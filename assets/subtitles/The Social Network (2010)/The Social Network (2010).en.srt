00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,937
You know there are more people
with genius IQ living in China

3
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:19,975
than they're people of any
kind living in United States.

4
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,041
That can't be possible be true.

5
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:21,858
That is.

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,643
What would account for that?

7
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:24,074
First, awful lot people living in China.

8
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:25,550
But, here's my question.

9
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,214
How do you distinguish yourself than

10
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:29,277
population of people who
all got 1600 under SAT's?

11
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:31,513
- I didn't know they take SAT's in China.
- They don't.

12
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:33,607
I wasn't talkin' about China anymore.
I was talkin' about me.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,841
You got 1600?

14
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:36,959
Yes. I can sing in a Capella group,
but I can't sing.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,220
Does that mean you
actually got nothing wrong?

16
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,380
I could row crew or invent a 25 dollar PC.

17
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:42,920
- Or you get into the "Final Club"?
- Or I get into the "Final Club".

18
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:44,411
You know, from a woman's perspective...

19
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,610
Sometimes, not singing in
a Capella group is a good thing.

20
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:47,107
This is serious.

21
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:48,939
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

22
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:51,042
Well, I can't do that.

23
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:52,158
I was kidding.

24
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:53,435
Yes, I got nothing wrong in test.

25
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:54,582
Have you ever tried?

26
00:00:54,615 --> 00:00:55,661
I'm trying right now.

27
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:56,357
To row crew?

28
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,335
Gettin' into "Final Club". To row crew? No!
Are you like... whatever, delusional?

29
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,545
Maybe, sometimes you said 2 things at once,

30
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:03,265
I'm not sure which one I
suppose to be aiming at...

31
00:01:03,298 --> 00:01:04,879
But you seen guys who row crew, right?

32
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:06,177
No.

33
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,957
Ok, well, they bigger than me.
They world class athlete.

34
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:09,921
Like a second ago you said
you like guys who row crew.

35
00:01:09,956 --> 00:01:10,634
So I assumed you've met one.

36
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:13,909
I guess, I just meant like the idea of it,
you know the way a girl likes cowboys.

37
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:15,831
Ok.

38
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,722
Should we get something to eat?

39
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:18,966
Would you like to talk about something else?

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,763
No, it just that since the beginning of
the conversation about the "Finals Club"

41
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:24,617
I think I may have miss a birthday.

42
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,278
There are really more people in
China with genius IQ's than entire...

43
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:31,623
"Phoenix" is the most diverse.
The "Fry Club", Roosevelt punched the porc.

44
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:32,353
Which one?

45
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:34,276
"The Porcellian, the Porc,
it's the best of the best"

46
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,240
Which Roosevelt?

47
00:01:35,274 --> 00:01:36,435
Theodore

48
00:01:37,454 --> 00:01:39,371
Is it true they send a bus
around to pick up the girls?

49
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:41,292
Who wanna party with next phoenix chairman.

50
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:43,356
So you can see why it's
so important to get in.

51
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,063
Well, which is the easiest to get into?

52
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:48,743
Why would you ask me that?

53
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:49,996
I was just asking.

54
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:51,990
None of them.
That's the point.

55
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:55,367
My friend, Eduardo made $300.000
betting oil futures one summer.

56
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:58,710
And Eduardo won't comes close to get in. The ability
to make money doesn't impress anybody around here.

57
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:01,793
Must be nice.
He made $300.000 in a summer.

58
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:02,884
He likes meteorology.

59
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:04,332
You said it was oil futures.

60
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,073
You can read the weather, you can
predict the price of heating oil.

61
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:09,128
I think you ask me that because you think
the "Final Club" that's easiest to get into

62
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,997
Is the one, where I'll have the best chance...

63
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,616
What?

64
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:14,219
You ask me which one is the easiest to get into

65
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:16,551
Because you think that the one,
where I have the best chance.

66
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:18,686
The one that the easiest is to get into,

67
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,615
Would be the one where
anybody has the best chance.

68
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,330
You didn't ask me which
one was the best one.

69
00:02:22,364 --> 00:02:23,937
You ask me which one was the easiest one.

70
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:25,483
I was honestly just asking, ok...

71
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:29,192
I was just asking to ask...
Mark, I'm not speaking in code.

72
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:29,915
Erika,

73
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,566
You obsesses with "Finals Clubs"

74
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:33,418
You have "Finals Clubs"- OCD

75
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,762
You need to see someone about it.

76
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:36,038
who'll prescribe you some sort of medication

77
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,185
You don't care if the side
effect may include blindness.

78
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:41,625
"Final Clubs" not "Finals Clubs"

79
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:44,515
And there's a difference between
being obsessed than being motivated.

80
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:47,067
Yes, there is.

81
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,371
Well, you do that, it's was cryptic,
so you do speaking code.

82
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,420
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

83
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:53,871
I'm just saying I need to do something substantial
in order to get the attention of the club.

84
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:54,423
Why?

85
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,912
Because they're exclusive and fun.

86
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:58,156
And they lead to the better life.

87
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,076
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get
elected for the president

88
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:01,467
because he was member from "Phoenix" Club?

89
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:03,623
He was a member of The
Porcellian, and yes he did.

90
00:03:03,657 --> 00:03:07,865
Why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you, you can be.

91
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:08,804
Did you really just said that?

92
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:09,711
I was kidding.

93
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:13,854
I wanna try to be straight forward

94
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:15,576
You might wanna be a little more supportive.

95
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,777
If I get in I will be taking you to the events

96
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:20,912
and the gatherings and will be meeting a
lot of people you won't normally get to meet.

97
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:24,556
You would do that for me?

98
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,877
We're dating.

99
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:32,640
Ok, well I wanna try and be straight forward
even let you know that we're not anymore.

100
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:33,312
What you mean?

101
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,379
We're not dating anymore.
I'm sorry.

102
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:36,134
This is a joke?

103
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:37,167
No, it's not.

104
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,441
You're breaking up with me?

105
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:41,399
You gonna introduce me the people I
wouldn't normally have the chance to meet.

106
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:42,442
What the f...

107
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:44,156
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Wait, settle down.

108
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:44,884
What is it supposed to mean?

109
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:46,344
Erica, the reason we're able
to sit and drink right now,

110
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:49,028
because you used to
sleep with the door guy.

111
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,026
"The door guy" his name is Bobby.

112
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:52,897
I have not slept with "the door guy".

113
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,319
"The door guy" is a friend of mine.

114
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:56,655
And he's the perfectly good class of people.

115
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:59,534
And what part of Long Island you from?
Wimbledon?

116
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:01,360
- Wait
- I'm going back to my dormy.

117
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:02,847
- Wait, wait is this real?
- Yes.

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,066
Ok, than wait, I apologize, ok...

119
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,252
- I have to go study.
- Erika...

120
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,344
- Yes?
- I'm sorry, I meant it.

121
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:09,128
I appreciate that but
I have to go study.

122
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:09,849
Come on.
You don't have to study.

123
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:10,987
You don't have to study.
Let just talk.

124
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,063
- I can't
- Why?

125
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:14,860
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a stairmaster.

126
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,004
All I meant is that you not likely to...

127
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,774
Currently, I wasn't making
a comment on you're parents.

128
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:19,565
I was saying that you go to B.U. *Boston University*

129
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:20,612
I was studying a fact.
That's all.

130
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:21,668
If it's seem rude,
than of course I've to apologize.

131
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,586
I have to go study.

132
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,471
You don't have to study.

133
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:24,487
Why you keep saying that
I don't need to study.

134
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:26,375
Because you go to B.U.

135
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,422
Wanna get some food?

136
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:33,276
I'm sorry you're not sufficiently
impressed with my educations.

137
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,838
I'm sorry, I don't have a row boat.

138
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:36,500
- So we're even.
- I think we should just be friend.

139
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:37,649
I don't want friends.

140
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:40,269
I was just being polite. I have no
intention of being friends with you...

141
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:42,235
I'm under some pressure
right now from my OS class.

142
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:44,168
If could just order some food.
I think we should...

143
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,750
Look, you will probably going to
be very successful computer person.

144
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:52,183
You gonna go thru life thinking
that girls don't like you,

145
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:54,298
Because you're a nerd...

146
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,250
I want you know, from the bottom
of my heart that won't be true.

147
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:03,271
It would be because you are an asshole.

148
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:27,079
<i>Harvard University, Fall 2003</i>

149
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,559
Kirkland House

150
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:58,300
Erika Albright's a bitch

151
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,470
You think that's because her family
changed their name from Albrecht?

152
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:03,858
Or do you think because
all B.U. girls are bitches?

153
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:09,494
For the record, she may look like a 34C.

154
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:12,245
But she's getting all kind of help
from our friends at "Victoria's Secret"

155
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:15,293
She's a 34B, as in
barely anything there.

156
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,254
False Advertising.

157
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:23,649
The truth is she has a nice face. I need
to do something to take my mind of her.

158
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:26,571
Easy enough, except I need an idea.

159
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:34,585
I'm a little intoxicated.
I'm not gonna lie.

160
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:37,505
So, what if it's not even 10pm
and it's a Tuesday night?

161
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:39,471
The Kirkland's facebook
is open on my desktop

162
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:43,159
And somebody of these people with
pretty horrendous facebook pics.

163
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:44,312
Billy Olsen's sitting here had the idea,

164
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,807
putting some of the picture
next to picture of farm animal,

165
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:48,150
and have people vote who's hotter.

166
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,110
Good call, Mr. Olsen!

167
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:58,129
Yeah, it's on.

168
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:01,298
I'm not gonna do the farm animal but I
like the idea of comparing two people together.

169
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:04,793
It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel since
people's rating of the picture is more implicit...

170
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:08,806
Than say, choosing a number to represent each
person's hotness like they do on hotornot. com

171
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,066
The first thing we're going
to need is a lot of picture

172
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,484
Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't
keep a public centralized facebook,

173
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:16,827
So I'm going to get all the images from
the individual houses that people are in,

174
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:19,706
Let the hacking begin!

175
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:39,259
First up is Kirkland, they keep everything open
and allow indexes in their Apache configuration,

176
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:43,168
So a little wget magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirkland facebook.

177
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:44,318
Kid's stuff.

178
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:03,624
Next is Eliot. They're also open,
but with no indexes in Apache.

179
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:07,408
I can run an empty search and it returns all
of the images in the database in a single page.

180
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,626
Then I can save the page and Mozilla will save all
the images for me. Excellent. Moving right along.

181
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:12,547
Excellent.
Moving right along.

182
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:14,418
Excuse me, everybody...

183
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:20,778
You're in one of the oldest, one of the most
exclusive club, not just Harvard but in the world.

184
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:25,284
Now, I wanna welcome you all, The Phoenix
Club First Party of the fall semester.

185
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:35,393
Lowell has some security they require
username/password combo.

186
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:37,889
I'm gonna go ahead and says the don't have an access to main fas user database

187
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,192
So they have no worry detecting an intrusion.

188
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:44,100
Adams has no security but limit
the number of result to 20 of pages,

189
00:10:44,134 --> 00:10:48,009
All I need to do is to break up some
script I use on Lowell and reset.

190
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:50,518
Quincy has no online facebook,
what a shame!

191
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,741
Nothing I can do about that.

192
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:56,895
Dunster is intense not only there's no public
directory but there's no directory at all.

193
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,605
You have to do searches. And if you're search
return more than 20 matches, nothing's get return.

194
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:02,855
Once you do get result, they
don't link directly to images.

195
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:04,696
They link to PHP that
redirect to something.

196
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,354
Weird! That's maybe difficult,
I'll come back later.

197
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:08,320
- Hei, Mark!
- What?

198
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:10,620
Great one.
Beautiful fish.

199
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:13,105
Leverett is a little better.
They still make you search.

200
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:16,201
But you can do an empty search and get
links to pages with every students pictures

201
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:18,620
I slightly obnoxious that they only
let you view one picture at a time...

202
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:21,445
There's no way I'm gonna go to 500
pages to download pics one at a time

203
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:25,033
So it's definitely necessary to break
out emacs and modify that Perl script.

204
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,345
Done.

205
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,609
Hey, what's goin' on?

206
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,798
Perfect timing.

207
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:48,076
Eduardo is here and he is going
to have the key ingredients

208
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:49,642
- Hey Mark,
- Eduardo...

209
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:52,066
You and Erica split up?

210
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:53,022
How did you know that?

211
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:55,508
It's on your blog.

212
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:55,989
Yeah.

213
00:11:55,989 --> 00:11:56,767
Are you alright?

214
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:58,568
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.

215
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,515
No, I need the algorithm you
use to rank chess players.

216
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:02,500
Are you ok?

217
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:05,640
We're ranking girls.

218
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:07,688
- You mean others student.
- Yup.

219
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:09,705
You think this such a good idea?

220
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:14,263
I need the algorithm, alright.
I need the algorithm.

221
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:16,086
Each girl base rating 1400.

222
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:20,561
At any given time "Girl A" has a rating
R-a and "Girl B" has a rating R-b.

223
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:21,938
When any 2 girls are matched up,

224
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,393
there's an expectation of which will
win based on their current rating, right?

225
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:27,312
And all those expectations
are express this way.

226
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:29,231
Let's write it.

227
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:45,682
The one on the left.

228
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:48,815
The right.

229
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:49,197
It works.

230
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:51,250
Who should we send it first?

231
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:51,427
- Dwyer
- Neal

232
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,360
Who will you send it to?

233
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:58,062
Just to couple of people.
Question is: who are they gonna send it to?

234
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:29,297
Hey, guys check this out.

235
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:34,044
Right or left.

236
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:34,563
Look this hot.

237
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:41,142
She's my room mate.

238
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:46,019
This is pathetic.

239
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:55,028
Albright?

240
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:57,134
He blog about you.

241
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,956
You don't wanna read it.

242
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:10,496
Erika, is this yours?

243
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:25,202
Awful lot of traffic.

244
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:29,750
You think maybe we should shut
it down before get into trouble.

245
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:39,559
Hello?

246
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:43,751
Wa-wait... what?

247
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:44,496
At 4 in the morning?

248
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,072
Well, this very an usual amount of
traffic to the switch of Kirkland.

249
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:50,020
You're saying it's unusual
for 4 in the morning?

250
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:53,373
No, this should be unusual
for half time at the superbowl.

251
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:55,376
Alright.

252
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:00,139
I'm gonna go in.

253
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:01,340
What's goin' on?

254
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:04,803
Harvard network is about to crash.

255
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:12,703
You don't think...

256
00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:14,465
I do...

257
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:18,222
Go to see if it's everybody...

258
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:23,095
I can't comin'

259
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,850
The network's down.

260
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:29,067
Unless, it's coincidence,
I think this is us.

261
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:30,236
It's not a coincidence.

262
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,921
Holy shit...

263
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:38,052
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

264
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:39,030
That's not what happen.

265
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,147
You weren't called in front
of the Administrator Board?

266
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:44,207
No, back, I mean... that's,
back at the bar with Erica Albright.

267
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,533
She said all that?
That I said that stuff to her.

268
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,400
I was reading from the
transcript for the deposition.

269
00:15:48,433 --> 00:15:50,201
Why we do even need to depose her?

270
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:51,356
That really for us to decide.

271
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,354
Miss, You think if I know she
can make me look like a jerk.

272
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:54,937
- I'll be more likely to settle.
- Mark...

273
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:57,063
Why don't we stretch our legs for
a minute, can we do that?

274
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:58,345
It's been almost 3 hours.

275
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:00,745
And frankly you did spend
awful lot of the time...

276
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:03,331
Embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg with
the girl's testimony from the bar.

277
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:05,193
I'm not embarrassed.
She just made a lot that up.

278
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:06,466
She was under oath.

279
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,719
I guess there would be the first
time somebody's lies under oath.

280
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:21,933
You got 22 hundred hits within 2 hours?

281
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:25,338
- Thousands.
- What?

282
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:29,769
Twenty-two *thousands*.

283
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,730
WOW...

284
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:49,274
These guys are pretty fast.

285
00:16:54,552 --> 00:16:57,346
Sure anybody make this a fair fight?

286
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,110
Jump up and swim.

287
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,424
I think we'd have to jump up and drowned.

288
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:04,259
Or you could row forward,
I could row backward.

289
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,671
We're genetically identical, science
says we'd stay in the one place.

290
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:10,631
Just row the damn boat.

291
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:18,262
- You guys here about this?
- What?

292
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:21,974
Two nights ago, a sophomore shut
the network from laptop at Kirkland.

293
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,436
- At 4AM.
- How?

294
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,074
He set up a website, where you vote
on the hotness female undergrads.

295
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:29,570
What were we doing that none
of us heard about this?

296
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:32,740
I do not know, 3 hour
technical row before breakfast

297
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:34,547
Full course load, studying.

298
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:36,410
Another 3 hours in
the tank then studying.

299
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:38,271
I'm not sure how we missed it.

300
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:39,957
How much activity was on those thing?

301
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,487
Twenty two thousands pages request.

302
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,855
This guy hack the facebook from 7 houses.

303
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,192
He set up the whole site in 1 night.
And he did it while he was drunk.

304
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:49,750
Twenty two thousands?

305
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:50,867
How do you know his drunk?

306
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:53,388
He was blogging simultaneously,

307
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:56,197
- You know what I think?
- I'm way ahead of you

308
00:17:56,198 --> 00:17:58,872
This is our guy.

309
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:04,436
Cameron Winklevoss, W-i-n-k-I-e-v-o-s-s,
Cameron spell the usual way.

310
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,913
Tyler Winklevoss, Tyler spell the usual way.
And my last name the same as my brother's.

311
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:12,949
Mr. Zuckerberg, This in an
Administration board hearing.

312
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:17,567
You're being accused of intentionally
breaching security, violating copyrights,

313
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,201
Violating individual privacy by
creating the website www.facemash.com.

314
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:27,751
You're also charge with being in violation university
policy on distribution of digitized imaging.

315
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:32,035
Before we begin with our questioning you're allowed
to make a statement, would you like to do so?

316
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:39,682
I've, You know, I've already apologize
to the Crimson, to the ABHW...

317
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:45,164
To Fuerza Latina, and to any women in Harvard may
have been insulted as I take it that they were.

318
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,806
As for any charges stemming from
the breach from the security,

319
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:51,108
I believe I deserve some
recognition from this board.

320
00:18:53,605 --> 00:18:54,601
I'm sorry?

321
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,010
Yes.

322
00:18:56,044 --> 00:18:56,971
I don't understand...

323
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:58,374
Which part?

324
00:18:58,407 --> 00:19:00,878
You deserve recognition?

325
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:03,214
I believe, I pointed out some
pretty gaping holes on your system...

326
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,589
- Excuse me, May I?
- Yes

327
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:11,201
Mr. Zuckerberg. I'm in charge of security
for all computer on the Harvard network.

328
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,596
And I can assure you of its sophistication.

329
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:17,387
In fact it was that level of sophistification
that led us to you in for less than 4 hours.

330
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,786
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

331
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:21,259
That would be impressive except if
you had know what you lookin' for,

332
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,742
You would've seen it written
on my dorm room window.

333
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:31,996
- So?
- Six month academic probation.

334
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:33,968
Well, they making an example out of you.

335
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:35,875
They have my blog.

336
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:38,131
I shouldn't have write nothing about
the farm animals. That was stupid.

337
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:41,710
But, I was kidding, for god sake.
Doesn't anybody have some sense of humour?

338
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:44,372
- But I tried to stop you.
- I know

339
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:45,484
How do you do these thing,

340
00:19:45,486 --> 00:19:47,480
How you manage to get
all girls to hate us.

341
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:49,017
- Why do I let you...
- I know.

342
00:19:49,402 --> 00:19:51,896
- Can't do that...
- Eduardo, I said enough.

343
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:54,134
Ok, let's look at a sample problem...

344
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:59,712
Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-bit
virtual address and a page size of 256 bytes.

345
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:04,653
The system uses one-level page
tables, which start at address 0x400.

346
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:08,377
Maybe you want to have DMA on
your 16-bit system, who knows?

347
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,894
The first few pages are
reserved for hardware flags, etc.

348
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:14,972
Assume page table entries
have eight status bits.

349
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:18,817
The eight status bits would then be...
Anybody?

350
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:22,672
And I see we have our first surrender.

351
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:26,021
Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberg, brighter men
than you have tried and failed at this class.

352
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:32,513
One valid bit, 1 modify bit,
1 reference bit and 5 permission bits.

353
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:34,447
That is correct.

354
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:36,173
Does everybody see how he got there?

355
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,318
Mark?

356
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:45,157
Are you Mark Zuckerberg?

357
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:46,096
Yeah.

358
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,363
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi...

359
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:49,478
Tyler Winklevoss.

360
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:51,099
Are you guys related?

361
00:20:51,133 --> 00:20:52,404
- It's good.
- Funny.

362
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:53,935
We never heard that before.

363
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,127
So what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

364
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:57,018
No, we didn't,

365
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:58,012
Actually... I don't know.

366
00:20:58,047 --> 00:20:58,976
We never asked.

367
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,045
Maybe we should do that...

368
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:02,516
Now, we have an idea we want to talk
you about.

369
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:04,986
You got a minute?

370
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:07,194
You guys look like
you spend some time at a gym.

371
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:08,991
We have to.

372
00:21:08,992 --> 00:21:12,219
- Why?
- We row crew.

373
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:15,244
- Yeah, I've got a minute.
- Great.

374
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:20,718
- So you ever been inside The Porcellian?
- No

375
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:23,365
Alright we gonna stay, we can't take you
past the bike room 'cause you're not a member.

376
00:21:23,397 --> 00:21:25,300
I've heard.

377
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:29,914
Wanna sandwich or something?

378
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:32,151
Ok, Mark, right?

379
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:34,127
- Mark, this is Divya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

380
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:35,759
We were really impressed with facemash.

381
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:38,302
And then we checked you out
and you also built CourseMatch.

382
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:39,275
I don't know CourseMatch.

383
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:41,606
You go online and you see what
courses your friend are takings...

384
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:44,049
You are really smart, man.

385
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,010
- Mark...
- Yeah.

386
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:48,931
We were talking about "CourseMatch"

387
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,483
It was kind of a no brainer.

388
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:53,490
And you invented something
in high school too, right?

389
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:57,271
An app for an MP3 player that
recognizes your taste in music.

390
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:59,346
Anybody try to buy it?

391
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,397
Microsoft.

392
00:22:01,432 --> 00:22:02,374
How much?

393
00:22:02,407 --> 00:22:04,299
I didn't sell it.
I uploaded for free.

394
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,726
- For free?
- Yeah.

395
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,894
Why?

396
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:12,720
Ok, well. We have something that we've been
working for a while. We think it's great.

397
00:22:12,752 --> 00:22:14,242
It's called HarvardConnection.

398
00:22:14,243 --> 00:22:17,144
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

399
00:22:17,145 --> 00:22:19,736
And then people could go
online, see your bio, request...

400
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:24,643
Yeah, how this different
from MySpace or Friendster?

401
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,931
Harvard-dot-E-D-U.

402
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:29,207
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country.

403
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,974
And the whole site kinda
base on the idea with girls...

404
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:35,244
- Not to putting anything in delicate.
- Girls wanna go with guys who go to Harvard.

405
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:37,644
Divya and my brother don't have
trouble putting things in delicate.

406
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:39,512
Many different between
what we're talkin' about

407
00:22:39,513 --> 00:22:42,564
and MySpace or Friendster any
others social networks inside...

408
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:45,317
Is that exclusivity...
Right?

409
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:46,720
Right.

410
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:48,300
Yeah, we'd love you
to work with this Mark.

411
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,398
We need a gifted programmer
and you're creative.

412
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,838
And we know you would
take this serious...

413
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,718
Womens group already declare a war...

414
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:57,340
You know, this could help
rehabilitate you image.

415
00:22:57,374 --> 00:23:00,326
Wow, you would do that for me?

416
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,556
We'd like to work with you.

417
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:06,458
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work at Google.

418
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:08,932
Our second programmer just got
overwhelmed with school work.

419
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:12,567
We will need you to build the site,
write the code and we'll provide...

420
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:13,624
I'm in...

421
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:17,958
- What?
- I'm in.

422
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,422
Awesome!

423
00:23:19,455 --> 00:23:21,653
That's what you said?

424
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:24,013
It was 3 or 4 years ago...
I don't know what I said.

425
00:23:24,048 --> 00:23:25,330
When did you come to Eduardo?

426
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:27,462
I don't understand the question.

427
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:29,563
Do you remember
answering an affirmative?

428
00:23:29,884 --> 00:23:30,864
The affirmative...

429
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:33,346
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for facebook?

430
00:23:33,381 --> 00:23:35,413
It was called "TheFacebook" then.

431
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,464
It doesn't need to be that difficult.

432
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:39,897
I'm35

433
00:23:39,898 --> 00:23:41,048
Did you answer affirmatively,

434
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:45,508
When Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Divya
Narendra ask you to build Harvard Connection,
4id I'd help.

435
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,140
Did you say, yes?

436
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:49,503
I sa currently in the middle
of 2 different law suits.

437
00:23:49,505 --> 00:23:52,576
When did you approached Mr. Saverin
with the idea for the facebook?

438
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:54,518
I wouldn't say I approached him.

439
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,383
Sy?

440
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:56,486
You can answer the question.

441
00:23:56,487 --> 00:23:58,884
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi

442
00:23:58,885 --> 00:23:59,961
What's that?

443
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:02,455
The jewish fraternity.

444
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,919
It was Caribbean night.

445
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:23,643
It's not that guys like me are
generally attracted to Asian girls.

446
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:26,787
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

447
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:30,459
I'm developing an algorithm to define the
connection between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

448
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:32,084
I don't think it's that complicated.

449
00:24:32,085 --> 00:24:36,170
They're hot, they're smart, they're
not Jewish and they can't dance.

450
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,000
- Hey, Mark's here.
- Mark.

451
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,121
I think I've come up with something.

452
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:54,087
Hang on, I've gotta tell you
something you're not going to believe.

453
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,559
- What?
- I got punched by the Phoenix.

454
00:24:58,674 --> 00:25:00,122
- Are You kidding?
- No.

455
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,137
I mean it's just the
first of the 4 step process,

456
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:04,729
But they slipped the invitation
under my door tonight.

457
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,455
I go to the first punch party tomorrow.

458
00:25:08,238 --> 00:25:10,262
You got punch by The Phoenix.

459
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:13,243
Yeah, probably, it was
just a diversity thing.

460
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:15,842
It was just a diversity thing.
I'll just ride that horse until...

461
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:18,057
What did you want to talk about?

462
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:18,863
- Mark?
- Yeah.

463
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,134
You said you've come up with something.

464
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:22,319
Yeah, I think I've come up
with something. Come outside.

465
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,865
It's 20 degrees outside.

466
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:28,663
I can't stare to that loop of Niagara falls which
has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean.

467
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:41,143
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

468
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:42,011
Yeah.

469
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:43,612
But it wasn't because the
saw pictures of hot girls.

470
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:45,211
You can go any around on the internet
and see pictures of hot girls.

471
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:45,945
Yeah.

472
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,778
That was because they saw
pictures of girls that they knew.

473
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:51,586
People wanna go on the internet
and check out their friends,

474
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:53,268
So why not build the
website that offers that?

475
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:56,822
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit, browse around.

476
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:59,799
Maybe its someone you just met at a party.
But I'm not talkin' about a dating site.

477
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:05,551
I'm talkin' about taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online.

478
00:26:05,553 --> 00:26:06,502
I can't feel my legs

479
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:09,971
I know, I'm totally psyched about this too.
But Wardo...

480
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:12,590
Yeah...
It would be exclusive.

481
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:15,748
You would've to know the people on
the site to get pass thru on page.

482
00:26:15,749 --> 00:26:17,528
Like getting punched.

483
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:19,096
That's good

484
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,404
Wardo, it's like a Final Clubs
except we're the president.

485
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:23,805
I told him I thought it sounded great.

486
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:26,364
It was a great idea.

487
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:27,866
There's nothing to hack.

488
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:30,904
People were gonna provide their own
pictures, their own information.

489
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:35,844
And people had the ability to invite
or not invite their friends to join.

490
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:39,249
See, in the world were the
social structure was everything.

491
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,029
Puff...
That was the "THING".

492
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,403
It was a big project.

493
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:46,201
And he was going to have to write
ten of thousands of lines of code.

494
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:48,710
So I wonder, why he was coming
to me and not to his room mate.

495
00:26:48,711 --> 00:26:51,483
Dustin Moskowitz and Chris
Hughes they're programmers.

496
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:55,324
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

497
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:56,855
So that was why.

498
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:58,707
- Did he offers terms?
- Yes.

499
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00,733
We'll split it.
70-30

500
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:03,159
Seventy for me, Thirty for you for
you, putting up a thousands dollar.

501
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,765
And for handling everything on the business end.
You're CFO

502
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:07,557
- And you said?
- I said "Let's do it"

503
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:11,506
- Ok, did he add anything else?
- Yes.

504
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:19,106
It probably was
a diversity thing but so what?

505
00:27:19,886 --> 00:27:21,044
Why do you think he said that?

506
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:23,269
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
But whose discovery it is?

507
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:25,509
- Sy, if you let me continue with my line of question...
- What do you suggesting?

508
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:28,433
They're suggesting I was jealous of
Eduardo for getting punched by Phoenix.

509
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:31,068
And began a plan to screw him out of
the company I haven't even invented yet.

510
00:27:31,102 --> 00:27:31,925
- Were you?
- Gretchen...

511
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:32,925
Jealous of Eduardo?

512
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:34,137
Oh, stop typing,
we're off the record.

513
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:35,349
Maam, I know you've
done your home work.

514
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:37,125
And so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life,

515
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:38,923
But at the moment I could buy
Mt. Auburn Street,

516
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,490
Take the Phoenix Club and
turn it into my pingpong room.

517
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:48,436
I'll let you know how the party is,

518
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:57,919
We recognize that you're a plaintiff in one
suit involving Facebook and a witness in another.

519
00:27:58,763 --> 00:28:00,563
- Yes, Sir.
- At any time In the weeks,

520
00:28:00,564 --> 00:28:02,363
Prior to Mark telling you his idea,

521
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:06,959
Did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron
Winklevoss, Divya Narendra or HarvardConnection?

522
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,605
Yes. He said they'd asked
him to work on their site.

523
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:13,059
But that he'd looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

524
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:18,226
He said even his most pathetic friends knew more about
getting people interested in a website than these guys.

525
00:28:18,835 --> 00:28:20,705
"These guys" meaning my clients.

526
00:28:20,707 --> 00:28:23,777
Yes. He resented, Mark
resented that they,

527
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:27,373
That your clients thought that he need to
rehabilitate his image after the Facemash.

528
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,916
But Mark didn't want to
rehabilitate anything.

529
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,055
With Facemash he'd hacked
into The Harvard computers,

530
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,192
He dumps his nose at the Ad Board.

531
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:34,819
He got a lot of honorarity.

532
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,445
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.

533
00:28:36,447 --> 00:28:39,741
Were you aware that while Mr.
Zuckerberg was building the Facebook,

534
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:41,246
He was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

535
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:44,477
Not at the time I wasn't.
But...

536
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:47,923
It really didn't have much to do
with The Winkelvoss dating site.

537
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:49,459
H- How would you know?
You' weren't even there...

538
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:53,624
Were you aware that while Mr.
Zuckerberg was building TheFacebook,

539
00:28:53,624 --> 00:28:56,378
He was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building HarvardConnection?

540
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,311
You're offering a conclusion
not found an evidence.

541
00:28:58,311 --> 00:29:00,041
We are about to finding new evidence...

542
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:05,869
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss
November 30, 2003

543
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:07,650
I read over all the stuff you
sent me re-HarvardConnection,

544
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:11,147
and it seems like it shouldn't
take too long to implement,

545
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:15,566
so we can talk about it after I get all
the basic functionality up tomorrow night.

546
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:20,303
From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron Winklevoss.
December 1, 2003.

547
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:23,297
"Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just
got about three of your missed calls.

548
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:26,173
I was working on a problem
set for my sytems class"

549
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:30,807
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler & Cameron Winklevoss.
December 10, 2003.

550
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:33,697
"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work"

551
00:29:33,698 --> 00:29:36,522
"So I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting."

552
00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:38,675
"I'm also really busy tomorrow"

553
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,557
Ok, anybody else feel like there
is somethin' up with this guy?

554
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:43,512
Tell him ok.

555
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:46,236
But we do have to make sure that we
meet up before we all head off for break.

556
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:19,820
- Hi Mark,
- Hi,

557
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:22,910
I need a dedicated Linux box running
Apache with a mySQL back-end.

558
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:24,782
It's gonna cost a little more money.

559
00:30:24,817 --> 00:30:26,710
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

560
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:29,545
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

561
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:34,082
- Do it.
- I already did.

562
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,420
Hey guess what...
I'm in the 2nd cut.

563
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:45,650
That's good. You should
be proud of that right there,

564
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:48,079
Don't worry if you
don't make it any further.

565
00:30:52,539 --> 00:30:53,500
I'll get out of here.

566
00:30:54,012 --> 00:30:57,814
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and
Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra.

567
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,684
December 15, 2003.

568
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:02,365
I have a cs problem set that
I'm just getting started with,

569
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:05,621
And It should be about 15 hours of
coding so I'll be busy tomorrow night,

570
00:31:05,622 --> 00:31:08,644
I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon.

571
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,954
I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

572
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:13,930
I've basically been in the
lab this whole time and also...

573
00:31:14,213 --> 00:31:18,053
Won't be able to do it Saturday as
I have to meet up with my parents...

574
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,046
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

575
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:31,306
It's also called The Statue of Three Lies.
What are the three lies?

576
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:33,509
Mr. Dowd.

577
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:34,684
The three lies,

578
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:37,041
First...
Shit!

579
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:38,988
- Take your pants off.
- I know.

580
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,367
Mr. Saverin.

581
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:47,141
1) Harvard was founded in 1636 not 1638.
2) Harvard was not founded by John Harvard

582
00:31:47,142 --> 00:31:48,842
and 3) That's not John Harvard.

583
00:31:48,843 --> 00:31:50,281
Who is it?

584
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:53,954
F- friend of the sculptor,
Daniel... Chester.

585
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,308
Keep you jacket on.

586
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:03,173
39 days after Mr. Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients

587
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:06,473
And he still hadn't completed
work on HarvardConnection.

588
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:10,125
But On January 11, 2004

589
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,770
Mr. Zuckerberg registered the domain
name theFacebook by Network Solution.

590
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:21,857
To the best of your knowledge, had he
even begun work on HarvardConnection?

591
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:25,973
Not to my knowledge.
No.

592
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,329
Hi Cameron, "I'm still
a little skeptical,

593
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,313
We have enough functionality in
the site to really draw the attention,

594
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:39,932
And gain the critical mass necessary
to get a site like this to run"

595
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,448
We'll speak soon?

596
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,781
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

597
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:47,645
Yes, he was

598
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:52,471
You'd sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,

599
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,605
And this was the first time he
indicated that he was not happy.

600
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:55,565
That's correct!

601
00:32:55,566 --> 00:32:58,693
He had 42 days to study our
system and get out ahead...

602
00:32:58,694 --> 00:33:00,795
Do you see any of your code on Facebook?

603
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:02,637
Did I use any of your code?

604
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:03,688
You stole our whole god damn idea.

605
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:04,647
Fellas,

606
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:06,633
What a match-dot-com for Harvard guys!

607
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:07,401
Can I continue with my deposition

608
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,183
You know you really don't need a
forensic team to get to bottom of this

609
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:15,842
If you guys were the inventors of
Facebook you'd have invented Facebook.

610
00:33:15,843 --> 00:33:18,971
I can't wait to stand over your
shoulder while you write us a check.

611
00:33:18,972 --> 00:33:20,075
No shit.

612
00:33:21,548 --> 00:33:22,738
Let's continue.

613
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:26,431
February 4, 2004

614
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:33,219
Mark...
Mark...

615
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,519
There is a girl in your art
history class name Stephanie Attis.

616
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:40,432
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

617
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:43,970
Have you ever seen her with anyone.

618
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:46,915
And if not, do you happen to know if
she's looking to go out with anyone?

619
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:49,890
Dustin...

620
00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:52,769
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says some...

621
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:25,942
We were supposed to meet at nine.

622
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:28,820
- Have you slept yet?
- I've to add something.

623
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,780
What?

624
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,976
Shit that's look good,
That's look really good.

625
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,184
It's clean and simple,
no disneyland...

626
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,103
But watch...

627
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:49,023
What'd you write?

628
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:53,250
Relationship status, Interested in,

629
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:55,905
This is what drives live in college.
Are you having sex or aren't you

630
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:58,844
It's why people take certain classes.
And sit where they sit.

631
00:34:58,878 --> 00:35:00,938
And do what they do, and
it's um, centre, you know,

632
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,858
That what's thefacebook
is gonna be about...

633
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,851
People gonna log on...

634
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,347
Because after all the cake and watermelon,
there's a chance they're actually gonna...

635
00:35:06,347 --> 00:35:09,202
- Get laid...
- Meet a girl. Yes.

636
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:11,003
- This is really good.
- And that was it.

637
00:35:11,228 --> 00:35:11,811
What d'you mean?

638
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:13,510
- It's ready.
- It's ready?

639
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:16,824
That was it, and here's the masthead.

640
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:18,778
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

641
00:35:18,811 --> 00:35:21,824
Eduardo Saverin, Co-Founder and CFO.

642
00:35:21,824 --> 00:35:24,000
You have no idea how what
that's gonna mean for my father.

643
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:25,438
Sure I do...

644
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:32,047
- When's it go on live?
- Right now, take your laptop out.

645
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:35,521
Why we do need my laptop.

646
00:35:35,554 --> 00:35:38,039
Because you've got e-mails
for everybody at Phoenix.

647
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:46,351
I'm not sure it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their...

648
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:47,784
It's not spam.

649
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:48,847
I know it's not spam

650
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,586
If we send it to our friends it'll
just bounce around the computer lab.

651
00:35:50,588 --> 00:35:52,181
I haven't gotten in yet.

652
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:55,724
These guys know people
and I need their e-mails.

653
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,686
- Sure
- Good.

654
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:00,177
Give me the mailing list.

655
00:36:00,177 --> 00:36:02,617
jabberwock12@harvard E-D-U.

656
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:03,476
These guys.

657
00:36:03,476 --> 00:36:06,768
They're literary geniuses 'cause the world's
most obvious Lewis Caroll reference is in their...

658
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:07,621
They're not so bad

659
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,275
I'm just saying.
Yeah, you're right.

660
00:36:16,722 --> 00:36:18,115
The site's live.

661
00:36:19,204 --> 00:36:22,804
You know, Let's go get
a drink and celebrate.

662
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:24,454
I'm buying.

663
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:28,188
Mark,

664
00:36:28,983 --> 00:36:32,586
Mark, are you praying?

665
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,949
What ever happened to Cole
Porter and Irving Berlin?

666
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:48,447
It's a Valentine's theme.
They playing love songs.

667
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:53,809
Good point, 'cause Cole Porter and
Irving Berlin never wrote any love songs.

668
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:57,722
Honey, just put your laptop away...

669
00:36:57,722 --> 00:36:59,737
Seventy four people
spam me the same link.

670
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:00,697
Casey...

671
00:37:00,697 --> 00:37:01,990
- What is it?
- I don't know

672
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:06,110
But I'm really hoping it's cat look like a
hitler 'cause I can never get enough of that.

673
00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:08,742
No, it's not.

674
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:16,527
Div?
What?

675
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,168
Div, w-what is wrong?

676
00:37:46,356 --> 00:37:48,083
- Hey!
- Not now!

677
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:50,615
- We need 20 mins.
- Ok.

678
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:56,527
I just want to let you know that
Zuckerberg stole our website.

679
00:37:56,528 --> 00:37:59,960
- Mark Zuckerberg?
- He stole our website.

680
00:38:00,922 --> 00:38:04,737
It's been alive for more than 36 hours.

681
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,117
Mr. Hotchkiss

682
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,599
Ty, the lawyer's on the phone with dad.

683
00:38:10,634 --> 00:38:12,539
Yes, Sir. I'm here with my brother
Tyler, our business partner, Divya.

684
00:38:12,572 --> 00:38:17,215
Welcome to theFacebook. theFacebook is an online directory
that connects people through different social networks.

685
00:38:17,248 --> 00:38:19,541
You must have a Harvard.edu
address to register.

686
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:20,501
That's right.
Yes, Sir.

687
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,760
I called earlier, I'm
looking for Mark Zuckerberg

688
00:38:22,762 --> 00:38:24,949
Yes, Sir. He's quoted a couple of times.
I can read it to you.

689
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:27,829
"Everyone's been talking a lot about
a universal facebook within Harvard"

690
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:32,336
I think it's kind of silly that it would take the
University a couple of years to get around to it.

691
00:38:32,336 --> 00:38:35,065
I can do it in class jobs than
they can't and I did it in a week.

692
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:37,802
- Tell him, Divya Narendra called, I appreciate it.
- That's how we talks.

693
00:38:38,284 --> 00:38:44,076
As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg set over
650 students to registered thefacebook.com

694
00:38:44,077 --> 00:38:47,672
He said that he anticipated 900 students
would've join the site by this morning.

695
00:38:47,706 --> 00:38:50,925
Divya was just reading that 650
students signed up on the first day

696
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:55,291
If I was I drug dealer I could give
free drugs to 650 people in one day.

697
00:38:55,324 --> 00:38:57,224
This guy doesn't have 3 friends to rob...

698
00:38:57,257 --> 00:38:58,528
Guys, please, come on...

699
00:38:58,561 --> 00:39:00,570
Alright that's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss

700
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:02,253
Then we e-mail it to you.

701
00:39:02,286 --> 00:39:04,547
You won't be able to get
on the website yourself.

702
00:39:04,581 --> 00:39:06,771
Because you don't have a harvard... uhm..

703
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:09,094
you know what it would be easy
for us to e-mail it to you.

704
00:39:09,128 --> 00:39:10,905
I'm sure you right... He's a good guy,

705
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:15,487
And he's very bright and I'm sure he
didn't mean to... do what he did.

706
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,559
Alright,
thank you very much...

707
00:39:17,592 --> 00:39:19,652
And Dad,
Love you too.

708
00:39:19,686 --> 00:39:20,347
He good guy?

709
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:22,179
We don't know that he's not a good guy.

710
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:23,443
We know he Stole our idea

711
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:24,675
We know that he lied to our
faces for a month and half

712
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:25,954
He never lie to our face

713
00:39:25,987 --> 00:39:27,875
He never saw our faces!
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts.

714
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:30,271
So he got himself 42-days head start

715
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,713
He knows what apparently you don't which
is that getting there first is everything.

716
00:39:33,713 --> 00:39:35,126
I'm a competitive racer, Div,

717
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:37,721
I don't think you need to school me on the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.

718
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:39,708
Alright, that's was your father's lawyer?

719
00:39:39,742 --> 00:39:40,525
Yeah, well his in-house counsel.

720
00:39:40,527 --> 00:39:44,193
He's gonna look at all this if he thinks it's
appropriate he'll send a cease and desist letter.

721
00:39:44,193 --> 00:39:45,909
What, do you wanna hire
an IP lawyer and sue him?

722
00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:49,177
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer!

723
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,329
- We don't have to do that.
- That's right.

724
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:51,494
We can do that ourself.

725
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:54,076
I'm six-five, 220lbs, and there's two of me.
I'm with this guy.

726
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:57,143
Whatever, I'm saying let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

727
00:39:57,175 --> 00:40:00,496
how much more information
are you waiting for.

728
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,461
We met with Mark 3 times, exchanged 52 e-mails,
we can prove that he looked at the code...

729
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:05,213
what is that on the bottom of page

730
00:40:05,246 --> 00:40:06,597
It's "A Mark Zuckerberg production"

731
00:40:06,632 --> 00:40:07,853
On the homepage?

732
00:40:07,885 --> 00:40:08,626
On every pages.

733
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:11,505
Shit. I need to let the
classiness waft over me.

734
00:40:11,507 --> 00:40:12,465
Ok, look...

735
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:14,452
They wrote, "Zuckerberg said that
he hoped the privacy options...

736
00:40:14,452 --> 00:40:19,123
...would help to restore his reputation
following student outrage over Facemash.com"

737
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:22,556
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us "the finger" in the Crimson

738
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:27,141
While we're waiting for dad's
lawyer to look this stuff over, we can at least...

739
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,940
No...

740
00:40:28,972 --> 00:40:32,601
We're not starting a knife fight in
the Crimson and we're not suing anybody.

741
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:35,853
Why not?

742
00:40:38,762 --> 00:40:40,146
He's gonna say it's stupid.

743
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:41,581
What, who?
Me?

744
00:40:41,614 --> 00:40:43,403
Say it why not?

745
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,556
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

746
00:40:46,556 --> 00:40:51,744
This is Harvard. Where you don't plant
stories and you don't sue people.

747
00:40:51,778 --> 00:40:54,260
You thought he was going to be the
only one who thought that was stupid?

748
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:58,030
During the time when you say you had this idea,

749
00:40:58,065 --> 00:41:01,434
Did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

750
00:41:01,434 --> 00:41:02,807
A family of means?

751
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:05,454
Did you know that his father was wealthy.

752
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:07,351
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

753
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:09,213
It's not important that you
be sure why I'm asking you.

754
00:41:09,246 --> 00:41:10,063
It's not important to you.

755
00:41:10,096 --> 00:41:11,012
Sy...

756
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:13,822
Did you know that they came from money?

757
00:41:13,856 --> 00:41:16,094
I had no idea whether they
came from money or not.

758
00:41:16,128 --> 00:41:21,266
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra you
reference Tate Winklevoss consulting firm.

759
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,507
If you say so.

760
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:26,248
Howard Winklevoss founded the firm and its
assets are in the hundreds of millions.

761
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:30,684
You also knew that Tyler and Cameron were members
of a Harvard Final club called the Porcellian.

762
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:31,643
They pointed that out?

763
00:41:31,644 --> 00:41:33,291
Excuse us for inviting you in.

764
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,907
To the bike room...

765
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,068
So it's safe to say you were
aware that my clients had money?

766
00:41:39,913 --> 00:41:40,653
Yes.

767
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:42,934
Let me tell you why I'm asking.
I'm wondering why...

768
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:46,833
If you needed a $1000 for an internet
venture you didn't ask my clients for it.

769
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:49,291
They'd demonstrated to you an
interest in this kind of thing...

770
00:41:49,324 --> 00:41:52,083
I went to my friend for the money because
that he's who I wanted to be partners with...

771
00:41:52,117 --> 00:41:56,606
Eduardo was presidents of the Harvard Inverstors
Association and he was also my best friend.

772
00:41:58,175 --> 00:42:01,519
Your best friend is suing
you for 600 million dollars.

773
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,490
I didn't know that.
tell me more!

774
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:06,045
Eduardo, what happen
after the initial lunch?

775
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,594
Sy would you mind addressing as Mr. Saverin

776
00:42:08,628 --> 00:42:09,393
Gretchen, they're best friend

777
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:10,130
Not anymore

778
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:12,030
I already went through this on the...

779
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:14,713
Nevermind, Mr. Saverin...

780
00:42:14,746 --> 00:42:16,061
It's exploded, everybody
on campus was using it

781
00:42:16,096 --> 00:42:21,353
"Facebook-me" was the common
expression after two weeks.

782
00:42:21,387 --> 00:42:23,114
and Mark...

783
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:26,809
And Mark was biggest thing on a campus
that included 19 Nobel Laureates,

784
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:30,090
15 Pulitzer Prize Winners,
two future Olympians

785
00:42:30,123 --> 00:42:31,559
and a movie star.

786
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:33,115
Who's the movie star?

787
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,802
Does it matter?

788
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:36,454
No.

789
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:47,766
Beautiful day. And I was up in my Radcliffe dorm.
He brought that magazine up and he saw it to me.

790
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:52,001
And he said, "Look, it's gonna happen
without us. We've got to start now."

791
00:42:52,034 --> 00:42:53,775
And I said... "Okay."

792
00:42:54,003 --> 00:42:55,538
Let's get basic hardware.

793
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,226
Now, most of you think you know the
rest of story that you may not.

794
00:42:58,226 --> 00:43:00,918
The beginning of the
industry were very humble...

795
00:43:00,952 --> 00:43:04,952
That kit computer on the cover of that
magazine, had an 8080 processor in it.

796
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:09,141
Unless you paid extra for 1K
memory board, you got 256bits,

797
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:11,059
So the challenges,
when I write the basic...

798
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:12,981
Wasn't just, uh... running 4Kbits

799
00:43:13,365 --> 00:43:17,780
But I also have to leave room for
users to run the programs in 4Kbits

800
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,909
Hi... your friend,
Isn't that Mark Zuckerberg?

801
00:43:21,943 --> 00:43:22,862
Yeah

802
00:43:22,896 --> 00:43:24,744
- He made facebook?
- Yeah.

803
00:43:24,744 --> 00:43:29,168
I mean both of us.
Yeah, we... yes.

804
00:43:29,202 --> 00:43:32,755
Cool. I'm Christy Lee.
This is Alice.

805
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:36,027
V- Very nice to meet you.

806
00:43:36,061 --> 00:43:38,570
Facebook-me when you get home
We can all go out and grab a drink.

807
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:43,331
Certainly, absolutely will do that.

808
00:43:48,753 --> 00:43:52,161
She said "Facebook-me" and we
can all go for a drink later.

809
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,697
Which is stunningly great for two reasons.

810
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,260
One she said "Facebook-me". Right?
And the other...

811
00:43:56,293 --> 00:43:57,251
- They wanna have drinks later.
- Yes

812
00:43:57,286 --> 00:44:00,675
Have you ever heard so many different good
things packed into one regular-sized sentence?

813
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,188
Excuse me. Mark?

814
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,416
Yeah

815
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:05,817
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your O.S. lab.

816
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:07,507
Sure.

817
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,570
- Awesome job with theFacebook.
- Awesome Job.

818
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,614
Thanks.

819
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:12,278
- I'm Bob.
- How are you doin'.

820
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,300
You know, I could swear he
was looking at you when he said

821
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,090
The next Bill Gates could
be right in this room.

822
00:44:17,123 --> 00:44:18,356
I doubt it

823
00:44:18,391 --> 00:44:22,221
I showed up late, I don't
even know who the speaker was.

824
00:44:22,253 --> 00:44:24,378
It was Bill Gates.

825
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,472
Shit... that's make sense.

826
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:28,804
Alright, thanks guys.

827
00:44:32,452 --> 00:44:33,784
Are you moron? Are you medically stupid?

828
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:35,148
You can't recognize Bill Gates
in front of you for an hour?

829
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,480
Mark Zuckerberg now thinks we got into Harvard
on a dimwit scholarship. I'm gonna get a Glock...

830
00:44:41,418 --> 00:44:42,840
It's time to monetize the thing.

831
00:44:42,873 --> 00:44:43,699
What are their natives?

832
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:45,311
- Did you heard what I just said?
- When?

833
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:47,684
I said it's times to monetize the site

834
00:44:48,336 --> 00:44:49,878
What is that mean?

835
00:44:49,911 --> 00:44:52,559
It means, it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

836
00:44:52,592 --> 00:44:55,940
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how do you want to do it?

837
00:44:55,974 --> 00:44:56,831
Advertising.

838
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:58,079
No.

839
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:00,288
We've got 4000 members.

840
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,501
'Cause theFacebook is cool.

841
00:45:01,534 --> 00:45:03,525
And if we start selling pop-ups
for Mountain Dew it's not gonna be cool.

842
00:45:03,525 --> 00:45:04,485
Well I wasn't thinking it would
be Mountain Dew but at some point,

843
00:45:05,445 --> 00:45:08,324
And I'm talkin' as the business
end of the company, the site...

844
00:45:08,324 --> 00:45:11,655
We don't even know what it
is yet, we don't what it is...

845
00:45:11,657 --> 00:45:12,615
We don't know what it can be.

846
00:45:12,617 --> 00:45:15,315
We don't know what it will be.
We know that it's cool,

847
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:18,016
That's a priceless asset
and I'm not giving it up.

848
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,144
- So it won't be finish?
- It won't be finish.

849
00:45:20,146 --> 00:45:21,856
That's the point, the way fashion never finish

850
00:45:21,858 --> 00:45:23,585
- What?
- Fashion, fashion is never finish.

851
00:45:23,585 --> 00:45:25,353
You talkin' about fashion, really you?

852
00:45:25,387 --> 00:45:28,157
I'm talkin' about the idea
I'm sayin' that never finish

853
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,644
Ok, but they manage to
make money, sellin' pants

854
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:34,134
Mark what is this?

855
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,554
What?

856
00:45:35,588 --> 00:45:37,686
It's called the cease and desist letter.
What were their names?

857
00:45:37,721 --> 00:45:39,000
- Who?
- The girls.

858
00:45:39,034 --> 00:45:39,751
When did you get this?

859
00:45:39,784 --> 00:45:42,161
About ten days ago.
Right after we launched the site

860
00:45:43,353 --> 00:45:44,112
Hey, the girls what were their names?

861
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:47,050
They're sayin'... the Winklevoss twins
are sayin' that you stole their idea.

862
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,264
I find that to be mildly annoying.

863
00:45:49,297 --> 00:45:52,701
They find it to be
Intelectual Property Theft.

864
00:45:52,733 --> 00:45:53,931
- Look...
- Why don't you show it to me?

865
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:55,577
It was addressed to me

866
00:45:55,612 --> 00:45:58,317
They're sayin' that we stole theFacebook
from Divya Narendra and the Winklevoss...

867
00:45:58,349 --> 00:45:59,347
I know what it says.

868
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,213
Did we?

869
00:46:00,246 --> 00:46:01,382
Did we what?

870
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:02,690
Don't screw around with me now.

871
00:46:02,724 --> 00:46:03,800
Look at me

872
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:05,606
The letter says we could face legal action.

873
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:07,347
No, it says I could face legal action

874
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,527
This is from lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds for...

875
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:11,556
The lawyer is their father's house counsel.

876
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:12,260
Do they have grounds?

877
00:46:12,295 --> 00:46:15,206
The grounds are our thing is cool and
popular and HarvardConnection is lame.

878
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,657
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise, I didn't use anything.

879
00:46:18,657 --> 00:46:21,916
Look, a guy who builds a really nice chair doesn't
owe money to everyone who's ever built a chair.

880
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,802
Ok, they came to me with
an idea. I had a better one.

881
00:46:24,123 --> 00:46:25,009
Why didn't you show me this letter

882
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:27,449
I didn't think it was a big deal

883
00:46:31,585 --> 00:46:34,940
If there's something wrong,
if there's ever anything wrong,

884
00:46:34,974 --> 00:46:37,025
You can tell me.

885
00:46:37,025 --> 00:46:37,985
I'm the guy that wants to help.

886
00:46:37,985 --> 00:46:38,945
This is our thing.

887
00:46:38,945 --> 00:46:42,583
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me

888
00:46:42,617 --> 00:46:45,880
No.

889
00:46:46,844 --> 00:46:48,693
What are we doing about this?

890
00:46:48,726 --> 00:46:51,965
I went to a 3-L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

891
00:46:51,998 --> 00:46:52,981
And what did you say?

892
00:46:53,014 --> 00:46:56,273
When we met in January, I
express my doubts about the site,

893
00:46:56,306 --> 00:47:00,387
where it stood with graphic, how much
programming was left that I had not anticipated...

894
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:02,306
...the lack of hardware we
had to deal with the site use,

895
00:47:02,307 --> 00:47:05,219
the lack of promotion that we go on
to successfully launch the website...

896
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:08,840
This was the first time you
raised any of those concern, right?

897
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:10,449
I'd raised concerns before.

898
00:47:10,483 --> 00:47:11,851
Bullshit
Not to us

899
00:47:11,885 --> 00:47:12,409
Gentlemen.

900
00:47:12,442 --> 00:47:16,052
I'm talkin about at the meeting in
January to which this letter is referring.

901
00:47:16,054 --> 00:47:16,981
Yeah.

902
00:47:17,014 --> 00:47:19,211
Let me re-phrase this.

903
00:47:19,213 --> 00:47:23,547
You sent my client 16 e-mails. In the
first 15, you did't raise any concerns

904
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:24,378
Is that a question?

905
00:47:24,413 --> 00:47:27,943
In the 16th e-mail you raised
concerns about the site functionality.

906
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:30,514
Were you leading them on for six weeks?

907
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:31,016
No.

908
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:34,012
Why didn't you raise any
of these concern before?

909
00:47:34,045 --> 00:47:34,929
It's raining.

910
00:47:34,963 --> 00:47:35,704
I'm sorry?

911
00:47:35,737 --> 00:47:36,818
It's just started raining.

912
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:40,391
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?

913
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:42,293
No.

914
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:44,661
Do you think I deserve it?

915
00:47:44,693 --> 00:47:45,753
What?

916
00:47:45,788 --> 00:47:49,025
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

917
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:52,264
I had to swear an oath before we began this
deposition, and I don't want to perjure myself,

918
00:47:52,297 --> 00:47:53,894
So I have a legal obligation to say no.

919
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:57,717
Okay - no.
You don't think I deserve your attention.

920
00:47:57,751 --> 00:48:00,447
I think if your clients want to sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,

921
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:01,940
They have the right to give it a try,

922
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,893
But there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

923
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:09,331
You have part of my attention -
you have the minimum amount.

924
00:48:09,365 --> 00:48:11,815
The rest of my attention is back
at the offices of theFacebook,

925
00:48:11,815 --> 00:48:14,204
Where my colleagues and I are doing
things that no one in this room,

926
00:48:14,204 --> 00:48:17,581
Including and especially your clients, are
intellectually or creatively capable of doing.

927
00:48:19,556 --> 00:48:23,277
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

928
00:48:29,793 --> 00:48:33,246
I have 12:45, why don't we say that's lunch.

929
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,699
Back at 02:30.

930
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:40,483
So what were their names?

931
00:48:40,516 --> 00:48:44,199
Their names are Christy and Alice.

932
00:48:44,233 --> 00:48:48,152
And They wanna have drinks tonight

933
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,351
I don't care.

934
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:40,447
Hey man, sorry, uhmm, couple of
girls refreshing up in there.

935
00:49:40,864 --> 00:49:42,860
Sweet...

936
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:49,603
We have groupies.

937
00:49:56,177 --> 00:49:58,420
I'll be right back
Hey, where you goin'?

938
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,088
Mark...

939
00:50:03,987 --> 00:50:04,945
Erica

940
00:50:07,248 --> 00:50:07,900
Hey

941
00:50:07,902 --> 00:50:08,902
I saw you from over there

942
00:50:08,936 --> 00:50:11,320
- I don't know you came to this club a lot.
- First time.

943
00:50:11,355 --> 00:50:12,525
Mine too.

944
00:50:12,557 --> 00:50:16,168
Can I talk you alone for a second?

945
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:17,525
I think I'm good right here

946
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:20,487
I just... I'd love to talk you alone

947
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:22,706
Right here is fine

948
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,543
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.

949
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:26,815
- No
- TheFacebook?

950
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,358
You called me a bitch on internet, Mark.

951
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,556
That's why, I wanna talk to you...

952
00:50:30,557 --> 00:50:31,708
- On the internet...
- If you could just...

953
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:33,010
That's why I came over

954
00:50:33,045 --> 00:50:34,864
Comparing women to farm animals?

955
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,268
I didn't end up doing that.

956
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:37,759
It didn't stop you from writing it.

957
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:44,108
As if every thought that tumbles through your head is
so clever, it would be a crime for it not to be share.

958
00:50:44,492 --> 00:50:47,132
The internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,

959
00:50:47,132 --> 00:50:49,755
And you published that
Erica Albright was a bitch.

960
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:54,342
Right before you made some ignorant
crack about my family's name, my bra size...

961
00:50:54,376 --> 00:50:56,692
And then rated women
based on their hotness.

962
00:50:56,693 --> 00:50:58,976
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

963
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:04,818
You write your snide bullshit from a dark room
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

964
00:51:05,525 --> 00:51:07,994
I was nice to you
don't torture me for it.

965
00:51:07,996 --> 00:51:09,815
If we could just go
somewhere for a minute...

966
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:12,210
I don't want to be rude to my friends,

967
00:51:12,211 --> 00:51:14,898
- Okay.
- Okay.

968
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:18,384
Good luck with your video game.

969
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:19,344
Dude, that's was great...

970
00:51:19,344 --> 00:51:22,195
That was right thing to do,
you apologize, right?

971
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,099
We have to expand.

972
00:51:29,516 --> 00:51:30,976
Is he mad about something?

973
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:34,501
Okay, we're expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

974
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:36,036
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.

975
00:51:36,038 --> 00:51:37,905
Chris, you're gonna be in
charge of publicity and outreach.

976
00:51:37,907 --> 00:51:40,489
You can start by gettin' a story in
B.U student newspaper. It's the bridge.

977
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:42,257
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

978
00:51:42,257 --> 00:51:44,416
Somebody at the newspaper will
be a computer science major.

979
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:46,646
Tell 'em Mark Zuckerberg will do 10
hours of free programming for them.

980
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:48,458
Why do you want a story
in the B.U. newspaper...

981
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:48,938
Because I do.

982
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:51,682
Now, here's the arrangement.
Eduardo's CFO and owns 30% of the company.

983
00:51:51,684 --> 00:51:55,960
Dustin's Vice President and Head of Programming
and his 5% of the company will come from my end.

984
00:51:55,994 --> 00:51:59,663
Chris is Director of Publicity and his compensation will
depend on the amount of work he ends up doing.

985
00:51:59,695 --> 00:52:00,960
- Any questions?
- Who the girls?

986
00:52:01,378 --> 00:52:03,887
Sorry, uhmm...
they are Christy and Alice.

987
00:52:03,983 --> 00:52:05,614
- Hi...
- Hi. Hello.

988
00:52:07,262 --> 00:52:09,766
- Is there anything we can do?
- No, that's it.

989
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,344
Yale and Columbia, let's go.

990
00:52:11,346 --> 00:52:13,273
- And Stanford...
- What?

991
00:52:13,275 --> 00:52:17,521
Standford. It's time for
them to see this in Palo Alto.

992
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:25,445
- You don't want any lunch?
- No.

993
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:26,686
You're welcome to some salad.

994
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:27,646
No, thank you.

995
00:52:34,365 --> 00:52:36,295
This must be hard.

996
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:38,190
Who are you?

997
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:40,711
I'm Marylin Delpy,
I introduced myself this morning.

998
00:52:40,713 --> 00:52:42,164
I mean, what do you do?

999
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:47,610
I'm a second year associate at the firm.
My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase.

1000
00:52:48,347 --> 00:52:50,632
What are you doin'?

1001
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:52,918
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

1002
00:52:52,952 --> 00:52:53,996
Bosnia?

1003
00:52:54,126 --> 00:52:57,190
They don't have roads
but they have Facebook.

1004
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:05,396
You must really hate the Winklevoss.

1005
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:07,748
I don't hate anybody.

1006
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,876
The Winklevii aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

1007
00:53:10,878 --> 00:53:13,342
They're suing me because for
the first time in their lives,

1008
00:53:13,344 --> 00:53:17,152
Things didn't work at the way
they were supposed to for them.

1009
00:53:23,137 --> 00:53:25,436
- He's expanding.
- What?

1010
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:28,940
He's expanding to Yale, Columbia and Stanford,
it's gonna be in the Crimson tomorrow.

1011
00:53:28,974 --> 00:53:29,947
Really?
Yeah.

1012
00:53:29,947 --> 00:53:33,123
Well, it's look like that Cease and desist letter
really scared the shit out of him, huh?

1013
00:53:33,155 --> 00:53:35,775
I want to hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief
and get this website taken down now!

1014
00:53:35,777 --> 00:53:36,032
Look...

1015
00:53:36,032 --> 00:53:38,844
Every minute, the site's up, Harvard
Connection become less valuable.

1016
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:42,838
I want an injunction, I want damages,
punitive relief and I want him dead.

1017
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,409
I want those things too!

1018
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:46,498
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?!
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?!

1019
00:53:46,498 --> 00:53:47,952
Because you're not thinking
about how it's gonna look.

1020
00:53:47,952 --> 00:53:48,831
How's it gonna look?

1021
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:52,563
Like my brother and I are in skeleton costumes
chasing the Karate Kid around a high school gym.

1022
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:56,211
Cam, he violated Massachusetts state law.

1023
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:59,380
When he goes to Connecticut, New York and
California he'll have violated federal law.

1024
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,530
And by the way, he's in violation of Harvard law.

1025
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,068
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1026
00:54:03,068 --> 00:54:05,983
Wait, Yes, there is.

1027
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:11,784
Harvard student handbook.

1028
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:14,664
Every freshman is issued one of this.
Somewhere in this book says...

1029
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:16,722
You can't steal from another student.

1030
00:54:17,969 --> 00:54:19,478
This is what we needed.

1031
00:54:19,704 --> 00:54:21,806
You can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1032
00:54:21,806 --> 00:54:25,304
My brother and I pay tuition at this
school, we carry a 3.9 GPA at this school,

1033
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:28,878
We've won trophies for this school and
We'll be rowing in the Olympics for this school.

1034
00:54:28,878 --> 00:54:31,329
I want a meeting with the
goddamn president of this school.

1035
00:54:32,322 --> 00:54:33,547
Why Stanford?

1036
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:36,882
W- Why do you think?

1037
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,641
I'm sorry, I'm late for Bio Chem..

1038
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:45,521
Okay.

1039
00:54:47,436 --> 00:54:49,534
You don't know my name, do you?

1040
00:54:49,568 --> 00:54:51,534
Is it Stanford?

1041
00:54:51,536 --> 00:54:53,443
I should just kick your ass.

1042
00:54:53,443 --> 00:54:55,320
How you go to party
and you meet somebody...

1043
00:54:55,322 --> 00:54:58,775
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda

1044
00:54:58,777 --> 00:55:02,293
Your father in commercial real estate
and your mother is 10 years sober.

1045
00:55:02,293 --> 00:55:03,847
What's my major?

1046
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:04,896
Trombone.

1047
00:55:04,896 --> 00:55:05,878
Really?

1048
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,715
I remember something about a trombone.

1049
00:55:07,717 --> 00:55:11,072
"Tu fais l'amour ŕ la jolie fille et la mets de côté"
*You make love to the pretty girl and put it aside*

1050
00:55:11,072 --> 00:55:12,675
- French...
- Oui

1051
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:13,635
Your major is French.

1052
00:55:13,635 --> 00:55:14,594
And yours?

1053
00:55:14,596 --> 00:55:14,981
Mine?

1054
00:55:15,494 --> 00:55:16,492
I don't have one.

1055
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,637
You haven't declared?

1056
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:20,072
I don't go to school.

1057
00:55:20,072 --> 00:55:22,313
- You kidding?
- No.

1058
00:55:22,826 --> 00:55:24,288
Where did you go to school?

1059
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:26,936
William Elementary for a little while,

1060
00:55:26,936 --> 00:55:30,561
Seriously, you're not like 15
years old or anything are you?

1061
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,858
No.

1062
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:34,215
But you're not like 15, are you?

1063
00:55:34,217 --> 00:55:35,751
No.

1064
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:37,869
So what do you do?

1065
00:55:39,137 --> 00:55:41,168
I'm an entrepreneur.

1066
00:55:41,202 --> 00:55:42,208
You're unemployed.

1067
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,364
I wouldn't say that.

1068
00:55:43,365 --> 00:55:44,550
What would you say?

1069
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,751
That I'm an entrepreneur.

1070
00:55:45,753 --> 00:55:47,387
Well then, what was your latest preneur?

1071
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:51,963
Well, I founded an internet company that
let folks download and share music for free.

1072
00:55:51,965 --> 00:55:53,235
Kinda like Napster?

1073
00:55:53,237 --> 00:55:54,726
Exactly like Napster.

1074
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,514
What do you mean?

1075
00:55:56,514 --> 00:55:57,849
I founded Napster.

1076
00:55:57,851 --> 00:55:59,735
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1077
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:01,463
Nice to meet you.

1078
00:56:01,463 --> 00:56:02,541
You're Sean Parker.

1079
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:07,338
Ah, you see, the shoe's on the other,
uh, table which has turned.

1080
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:09,311
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1081
00:56:09,311 --> 00:56:11,762
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1082
00:56:11,795 --> 00:56:13,047
You're zillionaire.

1083
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,273
Not technically

1084
00:56:14,306 --> 00:56:15,668
What are you?

1085
00:56:15,989 --> 00:56:18,045
Broke. There's not a lot of money in free music.

1086
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:20,855
Even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

1087
00:56:20,856 --> 00:56:22,452
This is blowing my mind.

1088
00:56:22,454 --> 00:56:23,221
I appreciate that

1089
00:56:23,222 --> 00:56:25,286
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1090
00:56:25,286 --> 00:56:28,742
Biochem, even know you are in French major,
whose name is Amy.

1091
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:30,663
You passed.

1092
00:56:30,664 --> 00:56:31,621
I'm a hard worker.

1093
00:56:33,733 --> 00:56:37,099
There's juice or anything else
you can find. Help yourself.

1094
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:38,186
You mind if I check my e-mail?

1095
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,858
Yeah. go ahead.

1096
00:56:49,454 --> 00:56:50,795
Amy...

1097
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:54,635
Amy?

1098
00:56:54,637 --> 00:56:55,596
Yeah!

1099
00:56:55,597 --> 00:56:56,760
Can you come out here?

1100
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:59,262
Just a second!

1101
00:57:01,398 --> 00:57:03,347
There's a snake in here, Amy.
What?

1102
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:06,940
Where?

1103
00:57:06,942 --> 00:57:08,860
Ok, there isn't snake but I need to ask you something.

1104
00:57:08,862 --> 00:57:10,960
Are you kidding me?
I could've been killed!

1105
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:11,998
How?

1106
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:15,826
By running to you fast and gettin' twisted...

1107
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,396
What do you need to ask me?

1108
00:57:17,429 --> 00:57:20,536
I went to check my e-mail
and there's a website open on your computer.

1109
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:24,125
Yeah. After you passed out last night,
I went on theFacebook for 'lil bit.

1110
00:57:24,157 --> 00:57:25,735
What's that?

1111
00:57:25,768 --> 00:57:28,791
TheFacebook? Standford had it for,
like two weeks now.

1112
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:32,451
It's really awesome except
it's freakishly addictive.

1113
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:34,768
Seriously, I'm on the thing like five times a day.

1114
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:36,586
You mind if I set myself an e-mail.

1115
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:38,373
Yes, everything okay?

1116
00:57:38,407 --> 00:57:39,867
Everything's great.

1117
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,967
I just need to find...

1118
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,045
You,
Mark Zuckerberg.

1119
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:49,864
I've never been in this building before.

1120
00:57:49,898 --> 00:57:52,947
This building is a hundred years
older than the country it's in.

1121
00:57:52,947 --> 00:57:54,483
So do be careful.

1122
00:57:55,155 --> 00:57:57,302
We're sitting in the chairs.

1123
00:57:57,302 --> 00:58:00,465
Yes. Very good.

1124
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:02,867
You can go in now.

1125
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:08,795
That's just their own stupidity,
I should have been there.

1126
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:13,177
Darkness is the absence of light and stupidity
in that instance was the absence of me.

1127
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:17,782
Catherine, I've got students in my office now.
Students. Undergrads.

1128
00:58:17,784 --> 00:58:22,208
I don't know, from the looks of it, they want
to sell me Brooks Brothers Franchise. Alright.

1129
00:58:23,268 --> 00:58:24,282
Good morning.
Good morning, Sir.

1130
00:58:24,315 --> 00:58:26,193
I'm Cameron Winklevoss and
this is my brother, Tyler.

1131
00:58:26,195 --> 00:58:29,766
And you here, because...

1132
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:31,273
Either of you can answer.

1133
00:58:31,306 --> 00:58:32,230
I thought you were reading the letter.

1134
00:58:32,231 --> 00:58:33,324
I've read the letter.

1135
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:36,246
Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called HarvardConnection...

1136
00:58:36,248 --> 00:58:38,400
That we've since changed
the name to ConnectU,

1137
00:58:38,626 --> 00:58:40,521
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

1138
00:58:40,556 --> 00:58:43,554
I'm understand. I'm asking
what you want me to do about it?

1139
00:58:43,556 --> 00:58:47,498
Well Sir, in The Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman...

1140
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,125
Under the heading "Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community"

1141
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,717
It says, The College expects
that all students to be honest...

1142
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:55,309
And forthcoming in their dealings
with members in this community.

1143
00:58:55,309 --> 00:58:58,936
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership.

1144
00:58:58,971 --> 00:59:00,775
Instances of theft, misappropriation or...

1145
00:59:00,777 --> 00:59:02,356
- Ann...
- Yes Sir.

1146
00:59:02,358 --> 00:59:04,409
Punch me in the face...
Go ahead.

1147
00:59:07,206 --> 00:59:10,826
Or unauthorized use will
result in disciplinary action,

1148
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:12,746
Including the requirement
to withdraw from the College.

1149
00:59:12,746 --> 00:59:14,987
You memorize that instead of doing, what?

1150
00:59:14,987 --> 00:59:18,757
What my brother and I come, here today,
to ask you, respectfully of course...

1151
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:21,291
Sir, it's against University rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

1152
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,675
You've spoken to your House-master.

1153
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:25,068
Yes Sir, and the House-master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board

1154
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,659
But the Ad Board won't hear us.

1155
00:59:26,693 --> 00:59:28,293
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

1156
00:59:28,327 --> 00:59:32,096
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of
our e-mails or phone calls for the last two weeks.

1157
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:34,202
He doesn't answer when we
knock on his door at Kirkland.

1158
00:59:34,202 --> 00:59:37,141
And the closest I've come to dealing with
him face to face is when I saw him on the quad,

1159
00:59:37,143 --> 00:59:38,547
And I chased him through Harvard Square.

1160
00:59:38,581 --> 00:59:39,170
You chased him?

1161
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:42,367
I- I saw him and I know he saw me
and after a minutes he disappeared.

1162
00:59:42,592 --> 00:59:44,505
I don't see this as the university issue.

1163
00:59:44,507 --> 00:59:46,159
Of course this is a university issue.

1164
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:48,271
There's a code of ethics and an
honor code and he violated them both.

1165
00:59:48,273 --> 00:59:52,168
You entered into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1166
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:55,648
I'm sorry President Summers, but
what you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1167
00:59:55,681 --> 00:59:57,030
I'm devastated by that.

1168
00:59:57,063 --> 00:59:59,612
What my brother means is if Mark
Zuckerberg breaking into our dorm room

1169
00:59:59,646 --> 01:00:02,045
And stole our computer, that
would be university issue.

1170
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,172
I don't know this office
doesn't handle petty larceny.

1171
01:00:04,206 --> 01:00:07,438
This isn't petty larceny. This idea
potentially worth millions of dollars.

1172
01:00:07,472 --> 01:00:08,594
- Millions?
- Yes.

1173
01:00:08,594 --> 01:00:11,117
You might just be letting your
imaginations run away with you.

1174
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,954
Sir, I actually don't think you're in
any position to make that call.

1175
01:00:13,987 --> 01:00:17,880
I was the U.S. Treasury Secretary,
I'm in some position to make that call

1176
01:00:17,913 --> 01:00:21,954
Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly
what we were told us to do in your freshmen address.

1177
01:00:21,987 --> 01:00:25,994
I would suggest that you let your imaginations
run away with you on a new project.

1178
01:00:26,027 --> 01:00:28,422
- You would?
- Yes, everyone at Harvard is eventing something.

1179
01:00:28,454 --> 01:00:32,943
Harvard Undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1180
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:36,856
So I suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new, new project.

1181
01:00:36,891 --> 01:00:38,327
I'm sorry, but that's not the point, Sir.

1182
01:00:38,362 --> 01:00:40,257
Please what's the point.

1183
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:43,056
You don't have to be an intellectual property expert
to understand the difference between right and wrong.

1184
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,481
And you're saying that I don't.

1185
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:45,762
Of course I'm not saying that.

1186
01:00:45,797 --> 01:00:47,161
I'm saying that.

1187
01:00:47,195 --> 01:00:47,983
- Really?
- Sir...

1188
01:00:48,802 --> 01:00:50,418
Ann... How do they get this appointment?

1189
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:52,601
Colleagues of their father...

1190
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:58,494
Let me tell you something Mr. Winklevoss,
Mr. Winklevoss, since you under subject of right and wrong.

1191
01:00:58,496 --> 01:01:02,429
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.

1192
01:01:02,463 --> 01:01:06,346
Is not worthy of Harvard,
Is not what Harvard saw in you...

1193
01:01:06,347 --> 01:01:08,266
You don't get special treatment!

1194
01:01:08,266 --> 01:01:09,623
We never ask for it...

1195
01:01:09,657 --> 01:01:12,826
Just start another project?
Like we're making a diorama for the science fair?

1196
01:01:12,827 --> 01:01:14,405
If you have problems with that Mr. Winklevoss

1197
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:15,606
We never ask for special treatment.

1198
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:18,077
The court are always at your disposal...

1199
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,527
Is there anything else, I could do for you?

1200
01:01:22,447 --> 01:01:23,405
Thank you very much for your time, Sir.

1201
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:33,211
Ups, broke 335 years old your door knob.

1202
01:01:34,961 --> 01:01:38,260
Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr.
Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1203
01:01:38,485 --> 01:01:40,014
What was the purpose of the trip?

1204
01:01:40,014 --> 01:01:44,661
Well, as CFO, I'd set up some
meetings with potential advertisers.

1205
01:01:44,983 --> 01:01:45,782
Who paid for the trip?

1206
01:01:45,784 --> 01:01:48,925
It was paid for out of the thousand dollar
account I'd set up a few months earlier.

1207
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:52,726
At this point your thousand dollars was the
only money that had been put into the company.

1208
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,318
Yes.

1209
01:01:53,414 --> 01:01:55,237
How did you feel the meetings went?

1210
01:01:56,282 --> 01:01:57,242
It went terribly.

1211
01:01:57,242 --> 01:01:58,253
Why?

1212
01:01:58,253 --> 01:01:59,211
Mark was asleep.

1213
01:01:59,213 --> 01:02:00,806
I was not asleep.

1214
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,213
Can I re-phrase my answer?

1215
01:02:02,215 --> 01:02:05,440
I wish he'd been asleep.

1216
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:10,534
So we're at 29 schools now
with over 75.000 members.

1217
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:14,666
People who go on theFacebook tend to stay
on longer than almost any other website.

1218
01:02:14,668 --> 01:02:19,333
Now here's the most impressive statistic,
61% of people who try it once, will come back...

1219
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:20,387
Now if you'll allow me...

1220
01:02:20,387 --> 01:02:22,434
Excuse me, one second...
What sound that he's making?

1221
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:24,583
Is that like a tsk...

1222
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,469
It wasn't tsk...

1223
01:02:28,143 --> 01:02:29,389
It was...

1224
01:02:30,349 --> 01:02:31,309
Like throttle sound

1225
01:02:32,269 --> 01:02:34,190
Almost a gag reflex

1226
01:02:35,949 --> 01:02:37,222
Guys, what is this?

1227
01:02:37,735 --> 01:02:39,996
There was one more meeting
scheduled for the New York trip.

1228
01:02:39,996 --> 01:02:40,956
Yes, it was a dinner.

1229
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,875
It was set up through my
girlfriend at the time.

1230
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,038
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

1231
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:48,342
Yes, very.

1232
01:02:48,344 --> 01:02:50,313
- Look, they're not gonna card us...
- They might.

1233
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:50,985
I mean look around.

1234
01:02:50,985 --> 01:02:51,945
It'll be embarrassing.

1235
01:02:52,137 --> 01:02:54,050
Tell him they're not gonna card us.

1236
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:55,010
They're not gonna card us.

1237
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:55,670
Mark...

1238
01:02:55,704 --> 01:02:56,807
Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1239
01:02:56,842 --> 01:03:00,431
Unless you're the Ballet Theatre of Hartford,
the purpose of a business is to make a profit.

1240
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:01,641
This isn't a business, yet.

1241
01:03:01,675 --> 01:03:06,269
That's tough for me because my job...
Nevermind.

1242
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:09,519
He's 25 mins late.

1243
01:03:09,905 --> 01:03:12,447
He founded Napster when
he was 19, he can be late.

1244
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:13,186
He's not a God.

1245
01:03:13,186 --> 01:03:14,351
Then what is he?

1246
01:03:14,351 --> 01:03:15,311
He's 25 minutes late.

1247
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:16,746
I think Wardo's jealous.

1248
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:19,940
I honestly wasn't jealous.
I was nervous.

1249
01:03:19,974 --> 01:03:21,168
Why?

1250
01:03:21,202 --> 01:03:25,360
I didn't know him at all but I
had done a search and asked around...

1251
01:03:25,362 --> 01:03:31,088
He struck me as kind of a wild card.

1252
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:31,929
Why?

1253
01:03:31,961 --> 01:03:35,802
He crashed out of two pretty big
internet companies in spectacular fashion,

1254
01:03:35,802 --> 01:03:36,766
He's had a reputation with drugs.

1255
01:03:37,086 --> 01:03:38,273
He also founded the companies.

1256
01:03:38,306 --> 01:03:40,130
We don't need him.

1257
01:03:40,164 --> 01:03:42,081
He's here.

1258
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:46,181
No, no, take your time.

1259
01:03:46,182 --> 01:03:47,429
And he does own a watch.

1260
01:03:47,813 --> 01:03:48,878
Stop it.

1261
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,190
I'm Sean Parker.

1262
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:51,572
How do you do.

1263
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:56,226
You must be Eduardo and Christy
and Mark, great to meet you.

1264
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,590
You guys don't have
anything in front of you.

1265
01:03:58,592 --> 01:03:59,072
Tori...

1266
01:03:59,264 --> 01:03:59,690
We were waiting...

1267
01:03:59,724 --> 01:04:00,722
Hey baby boy.

1268
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:02,170
Could you bring out some things?

1269
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:06,659
The lacquered pork with that ginger confit, tuna
tartar, and the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

1270
01:04:06,659 --> 01:04:10,233
Christy what do you like to drink?

1271
01:04:10,268 --> 01:04:11,112
An appletini

1272
01:04:11,146 --> 01:04:13,878
Great. Four of those.

1273
01:04:13,913 --> 01:04:16,585
From that point on it was a Sean-a-thon.

1274
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,079
The question was what did you talk about?

1275
01:04:38,871 --> 01:04:40,938
He took us through his episode with Napster.

1276
01:04:40,938 --> 01:04:43,818
I didn't want to spend my twenty
as a professional defendant

1277
01:04:43,818 --> 01:04:46,697
Who knew the music industry
doesn't have a sense of humor.

1278
01:04:46,914 --> 01:04:50,349
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 millions they said we owed in royalties,

1279
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:55,077
But I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen card to pay for the stolen gas.

1280
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:57,713
So we said, screw it,
we declare bankruptcy.

1281
01:04:57,713 --> 01:04:58,960
You made a name for yourself.

1282
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,521
And you are dry.

1283
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:02,081
- Tory...
- No, no, I'm good.

1284
01:05:02,081 --> 01:05:05,699
And then he went to his second business
venture which was an online rolodex.

1285
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:08,195
Says he got thrown off by Chase Equity.

1286
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:12,045
And I want to do it nice this time,
I put on a tie, I shine my shoes.

1287
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:13,815
But nobody want to take orders from a kid.

1288
01:05:13,815 --> 01:05:16,956
So let me tell you what happen...
to twenty-old to -- dot.com

1289
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:18,396
I'm not psychiatrist, but

1290
01:05:18,429 --> 01:05:19,514
I'm glad with got that on record.

1291
01:05:19,547 --> 01:05:22,003
You're not a psychiatrist, but what...

1292
01:05:22,003 --> 01:05:24,786
A psychiatrist would
say that he was paranoid.

1293
01:05:24,786 --> 01:05:26,681
They hire private detectives,
who follow you day and night.

1294
01:05:27,193 --> 01:05:29,829
You are target for hi press-escort.

1295
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:31,748
I can't prove it but I
know they tap my phone.

1296
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,628
Whatever it is that's gonna
trip you up, you're done already.

1297
01:05:34,628 --> 01:05:36,931
Private behaviour is
rally cover time gone by...

1298
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:39,811
And then somehow and someway you've
manage to live your life like a Dalai Lama

1299
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:40,771
Don't mixed it up.

1300
01:05:40,773 --> 01:05:43,380
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1301
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,608
And they want you to
say thank you while you,

1302
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,153
Excuse me... wipe your
chin and walk away.

1303
01:05:48,155 --> 01:05:49,298
That's what happen to you?

1304
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,539
And delusional.

1305
01:05:50,956 --> 01:05:52,030
Yes,

1306
01:05:52,063 --> 01:05:53,864
But... they'll be pay back.

1307
01:05:53,896 --> 01:05:57,570
In case I brought down the record company with
Napster and I left the company since then too.

1308
01:05:57,572 --> 01:06:00,961
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies. They won.

1309
01:06:00,963 --> 01:06:02,438
In court.
Yeah.

1310
01:06:02,472 --> 01:06:05,766
You wanna buy a Tower record, Eduardo?

1311
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:11,701
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

1312
01:06:11,702 --> 01:06:15,297
Parties at Stanford and down in LA,
friends who'd become millionaires,

1313
01:06:15,297 --> 01:06:20,164
But mostly how Mark had to,
he had to come to California.

1314
01:06:20,485 --> 01:06:23,190
And then he cut around to TheFacebook.

1315
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:25,456
So tell me about your progress.

1316
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:29,391
Well, we're in 29 schools now,
we got over 75 thousands members...

1317
01:06:29,393 --> 01:06:30,273
Tell me about the strategy.

1318
01:06:30,306 --> 01:06:34,760
Ok, for instance, we wanted Baylor in Texas but
Baylor already had a social network on campus

1319
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,110
So instead of going right after them, we made
a list of every school within a hundred miles

1320
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:39,632
And put TheFacebook on those campuses first.

1321
01:06:39,632 --> 01:06:41,744
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were
seeing their friends on our site.

1322
01:06:41,746 --> 01:06:43,001
- We were in.
- Its called a little bait for a big one.

1323
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:43,768
That's smart, Mark.

1324
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:44,601
Thanks that's was mine.

1325
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:44,996
Easy.

1326
01:06:44,996 --> 01:06:46,922
Hey you know what,
settle an argument for us,

1327
01:06:46,922 --> 01:06:48,847
I say it's time to start
making money from TheFacebook,

1328
01:06:48,847 --> 01:06:51,965
But Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1329
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:54,219
Neither of you yet.

1330
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:55,266
TheFacebook is cool,

1331
01:06:55,266 --> 01:06:56,311
- That's what it's got going for it.
- Yeah.

1332
01:06:57,016 --> 01:06:57,681
You don't want to ruin it with ads

1333
01:06:57,873 --> 01:06:59,248
- Because ads aren't cool.
- Exactly.

1334
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:01,239
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus.

1335
01:07:01,239 --> 01:07:03,036
And someone's saying,
it's gotta be over by 11:00.

1336
01:07:03,038 --> 01:07:04,050
That's exactly right.

1337
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,027
You don't even know what the thing is yet.

1338
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:07,778
How big it can get and how far it can go.

1339
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:09,704
This is no time to take your chips down.

1340
01:07:09,706 --> 01:07:11,581
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

1341
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:12,349
You?

1342
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,291
A billion dollars.

1343
01:07:19,851 --> 01:07:21,753
And that shut everybody up.

1344
01:07:21,786 --> 01:07:25,824
And that's where you're headed.
A billion dollar-valuation.

1345
01:07:25,826 --> 01:07:27,572
Unless you take bad advice,

1346
01:07:26,806 --> 01:07:29,318
In which case you might as well come up
with a chain of very successful yogurt shop.

1347
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:33,867
When you go fishing you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1348
01:07:33,867 --> 01:07:35,742
You ever walk into a guy's den and see a
picture of him standing next to fourteen trout?

1349
01:07:37,085 --> 01:07:38,809
No he's holding an 3000 pound marlin.

1350
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:39,956
- Yup.
- That's a good announce.

1351
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:42,835
But we all know, that marlin
won't weight 3000 pounds, right?

1352
01:07:42,869 --> 01:07:44,313
- I've seen a big one at close
- No, I haven't.

1353
01:07:44,313 --> 01:07:46,423
But I don't think the guy holdings
a marlin at size of a range rover.

1354
01:07:46,425 --> 01:07:49,179
That would really big fish
or a very strong guy.

1355
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:51,005
You think you might be
getting away from the point?

1356
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,148
I don't have a dog in this fight.

1357
01:07:52,148 --> 01:07:54,067
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1358
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:57,239
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1359
01:07:57,273 --> 01:08:01,021
He picked up the check, he told Mark
they'd talk again soon and he was gone.

1360
01:08:01,021 --> 01:08:04,574
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

1361
01:08:06,585 --> 01:08:11,135
Drop the "the".
Just Facebook. It's cleaner.

1362
01:08:14,494 --> 01:08:16,231
Shit.

1363
01:08:25,122 --> 01:08:27,828
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

1364
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:30,831
You want to end the party at eleven?

1365
01:08:30,864 --> 01:08:32,100
I'm trying to pay for the party.

1366
01:08:32,134 --> 01:08:35,032
There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1367
01:08:35,065 --> 01:08:36,434
What'd you think?

1368
01:08:36,435 --> 01:08:37,876
Yes, sure, let's drop the "the"

1369
01:08:37,877 --> 01:08:42,582
I meant catching the marlin instead of the 14 trouts.
Doesn't that sound good?

1370
01:08:42,615 --> 01:08:44,198
If you're a trout.

1371
01:08:44,199 --> 01:08:45,614
I'm going to enter this into the record.

1372
01:08:45,614 --> 01:08:49,329
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
and LLC registered in Florida,

1373
01:08:49,331 --> 01:08:51,563
- Why Florida?
- That's where my family lives.

1374
01:08:51,596 --> 01:08:55,587
And ask the respondent to stipulate that articles
of incorporation state the ownership as follows,

1375
01:08:55,588 --> 01:09:01,238
Sixty-five percent for Mark Zuckerberg,
30% for Eduardo Saverin and 5% for Dustin Moskowitz.

1376
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:02,109
We stipulate

1377
01:09:02,109 --> 01:09:04,189
And that was April 13th 2004

1378
01:09:04,189 --> 01:09:05,341
You can mark it.

1379
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:06,375
Do you have anything here?

1380
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:09,020
Yes, thank you.
Mr. Saverin,

1381
01:09:09,054 --> 01:09:15,213
Have you ever done anything that might be
considered legitimate ground for termination?

1382
01:09:15,247 --> 01:09:16,126
No.

1383
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:20,865
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardize it?

1384
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:21,457
No.

1385
01:09:21,793 --> 01:09:22,475
No?

1386
01:09:25,466 --> 01:09:26,506
No.

1387
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:30,399
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1388
01:09:30,431 --> 01:09:31,889
Wait.

1389
01:09:31,921 --> 01:09:33,096
You weren't?

1390
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:34,578
T- this not happening.

1391
01:09:34,613 --> 01:09:36,784
I have here an article from The Crimson...

1392
01:09:36,818 --> 01:09:38,673
Jesus Christ...

1393
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:39,710
I can't have this, Wardo.

1394
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:44,728
Come on, man this is bullshit, this is
another clubs playing a prank.

1395
01:09:44,761 --> 01:09:48,606
I'd gotten into the Phoenix. I'd been
accepted and as part of my initiation,

1396
01:09:48,608 --> 01:09:52,905
I had to, for one week, carry with me
all the times and take care of a chicken.

1397
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:57,259
They identify you as one of the founders
of TheFacebook, "Junior Eduardo Saverin,"

1398
01:09:57,292 --> 01:10:00,461
I'm not the expert but being connected to
torturing animals is probably bad for business.

1399
01:10:00,493 --> 01:10:05,064
I did not torture the chicken,
I don't torture chickens, are you crazy?

1400
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:06,819
No, and settle down, please.

1401
01:10:06,819 --> 01:10:08,483
I have here, an article from The Crimson...

1402
01:10:08,484 --> 01:10:09,868
This is scathing.

1403
01:10:09,902 --> 01:10:11,140
Nine-hundred-fifty-six.

1404
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:13,885
I was having dinner in the
Kirkland Dining Hall with Mark,

1405
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,293
And I had the chicken with me,

1406
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:18,395
Because I had to have the chicken
with me at all times. This was college.

1407
01:10:18,429 --> 01:10:20,087
Somebody gonna have to answer for this.

1408
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:20,908
Nine-hundred-sixty-nine.

1409
01:10:20,943 --> 01:10:24,537
Dining hall was serving chicken for dinner
and I had to feed my chicken.

1410
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:28,451
So I took... Little pieces of
chicken and gave it to the chicken.

1411
01:10:28,452 --> 01:10:30,595
Someone must have seen me
because the next thing I knew,

1412
01:10:30,596 --> 01:10:32,739
I was being accused
of forced cannibalism.

1413
01:10:33,283 --> 01:10:37,599
I didn't know you could't do that. I dealt
with the various animal rights groups,

1414
01:10:37,631 --> 01:10:42,041
I dealt with the Associate Dean of
the College, this was all resolved.

1415
01:10:42,074 --> 01:10:43,087
Nine-hundred-eighty-eight.

1416
01:10:43,122 --> 01:10:45,307
Someone from the Porc or
the Fly must have reported it.

1417
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:47,104
For all I know it was the Winklevoss...

1418
01:10:47,137 --> 01:10:48,675
Alright, let's just forget about it.

1419
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:51,720
This is absurd, I'm being
accused of animal cruelty.

1420
01:10:51,721 --> 01:10:53,006
Better to be accused of Necrophilia.

1421
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:54,356
It is better to be accused of Necrophilia.

1422
01:10:54,774 --> 01:10:56,006
I have to explain this to my father,

1423
01:10:56,006 --> 01:10:59,444
I'm gonna explain this to everybody, I'm
gonna... what is happening on that?

1424
01:10:59,444 --> 01:11:01,697
I have my final coming up for
"Postwar and Contemporary Art".

1425
01:11:01,698 --> 01:11:04,296
And I haven't been to class. I'm supposed
to write about those four paintings.

1426
01:11:04,331 --> 01:11:05,185
Is that a facebook page?

1427
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:08,414
Yeah, I opened it under an alias. I posted
the paintings and asked people to comment.

1428
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:11,216
Every once in a while, I hop on and
stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1429
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,274
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating on his final exam?

1430
01:11:13,309 --> 01:11:15,239
I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.

1431
01:11:15,273 --> 01:11:16,141
Then why not?

1432
01:11:16,176 --> 01:11:20,229
Because I'm not suing him for cheating on his
final exam and so that's not what friends do.

1433
01:11:20,262 --> 01:11:22,193
Well you just told us he was cheating.

1434
01:11:23,474 --> 01:11:25,967
Oops.

1435
01:11:26,002 --> 01:11:28,396
You told your lawyers I was torturing animals?!

1436
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:29,721
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1437
01:11:29,756 --> 01:11:32,576
Our litigators are capable
of finding Crimson article.

1438
01:11:32,577 --> 01:11:36,738
In fact when we raised the
subject with him he defended you.

1439
01:11:37,346 --> 01:11:38,587
Oops.

1440
01:11:38,622 --> 01:11:41,943
Nine-ninety-three, we are so close.

1441
01:11:41,976 --> 01:11:44,417
Oh yeah, that reminds me,
We're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1442
01:11:44,451 --> 01:11:46,823
I agree. More servers, more apps...

1443
01:11:46,856 --> 01:11:49,554
I'm interviewing two interns to come to Palo Alto
and we're gonna have to pay them something.

1444
01:11:49,587 --> 01:11:50,365
Sorry what?

1445
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:53,146
I already found a house for rent on a
street two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1446
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,787
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

1447
01:11:54,819 --> 01:11:56,393
When did you decide to go
to California for the summer?

1448
01:11:56,426 --> 01:11:57,621
You mean when did I actually decide?

1449
01:11:57,654 --> 01:12:00,944
Somewhere in the middle of
The Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1450
01:12:00,979 --> 01:12:03,502
He was right.
California's the place we've gotta be.

1451
01:12:03,534 --> 01:12:04,894
Is you Jed Clampett?

1452
01:12:04,895 --> 01:12:06,556
You guys got The Beverly Hillbillies in Brazil...

1453
01:12:06,557 --> 01:12:08,376
Yes, we got the show in Brazil,
it was genius.

1454
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:10,234
What is your problem with Sean?

1455
01:12:10,269 --> 01:12:12,113
He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1456
01:12:12,113 --> 01:12:13,958
He doesn't have money,
Dustin's a better programmer...

1457
01:12:13,992 --> 01:12:15,336
He's got connections to the VCs.

1458
01:12:15,368 --> 01:12:18,770
We don't need VCs, we need advertisers
and I've got connections to the VCs.

1459
01:12:18,805 --> 01:12:19,974
- The real players and...
- Look.

1460
01:12:20,006 --> 01:12:21,512
As someone who's really embarrassed
the company in a bad way...

1461
01:12:22,025 --> 01:12:23,342
It was the Winklevosses, Mark!

1462
01:12:23,344 --> 01:12:26,506
Hang on.
Hit refresh.

1463
01:12:26,506 --> 01:12:29,185
150.004

1464
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:31,655
150.000 members, Wardo.

1465
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:32,764
Congratulations, dude.

1466
01:12:32,797 --> 01:12:33,886
Congratulations.

1467
01:12:33,921 --> 01:12:37,377
You don't think it was strange?
That he was followed by private detectives?

1468
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,882
Who came up with nothing.

1469
01:12:38,917 --> 01:12:41,100
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls...

1470
01:12:41,135 --> 01:12:42,226
We don't know any of that's true.

1471
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,286
You can read about it.

1472
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:45,438
I can read about your torturing birds.
Since when reading something about...

1473
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:48,451
Don't fish eat other fish?!
The marlins and the trout?!

1474
01:12:51,019 --> 01:12:51,534
What's he talkin' about?

1475
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:54,436
I'm interviewing interns at 10
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1476
01:12:54,438 --> 01:12:57,693
Get on board with this man, you know...
I don't really know what else to say.

1477
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:32,756
What's goin' on?

1478
01:13:32,757 --> 01:13:35,469
They have 10 mins to get root
access to a Python web server,

1479
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:38,536
Expose its SSL encryption and then
intercept all traffic over its secure port.

1480
01:13:38,537 --> 01:13:39,015
They're hacking.

1481
01:13:39,591 --> 01:13:41,738
All behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

1482
01:13:41,773 --> 01:13:43,332
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

1483
01:13:43,365 --> 01:13:44,604
- I do know that.
- So what's the beauty?

1484
01:13:44,636 --> 01:13:46,273
Every 10th line of code written,
they have to take a shot.

1485
01:13:46,306 --> 01:13:47,697
And hacking's supposed to be stealth,

1486
01:13:47,698 --> 01:13:51,006
So anytime the server detects an intrusion,
the candidate responsible has to take a shot.

1487
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:54,576
I also have a program running that has a pop-up
window appear simultaneously on all five computers...

1488
01:13:54,577 --> 01:13:56,770
The last candidate to hit
the window has to take a shot.

1489
01:13:56,804 --> 01:13:58,492
Plus every three minutes
they all have to take a shot.

1490
01:13:58,525 --> 01:14:00,073
Three minutes.

1491
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:05,154
Can I ask, what part of the interns jobs
will they need to be able to do drunk?

1492
01:14:05,189 --> 01:14:10,108
You're right. A more relevant test would be
seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1493
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:11,375
That was mean.

1494
01:14:11,376 --> 01:14:12,335
Here...

1495
01:14:12,336 --> 01:14:13,954
What is this.

1496
01:14:13,988 --> 01:14:15,798
I opened a new account
and put $18.000 in it.

1497
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:19,529
Will that get you through the summer?

1498
01:14:27,175 --> 01:14:29,451
Welcome to Facebook.

1499
01:14:38,386 --> 01:14:39,818
- $18.000
- Yes.

1500
01:14:39,819 --> 01:14:42,411
- In addition to the $1000 you'd already put up.
- Yes.

1501
01:14:42,412 --> 01:14:44,502
A total of $19.000 now.

1502
01:14:44,536 --> 01:14:45,756
- Yes.
- Hang on.

1503
01:14:47,962 --> 01:14:50,185
I'm just checking your math on that.

1504
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,126
Yes, I got the same thing.

1505
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:53,867
May I continue?

1506
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:58,939
After expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg taking
the company and moving it to California for the summer,

1507
01:14:58,972 --> 01:15:02,101
Why did you turn around and put
$18.000 in an account for his use?

1508
01:15:02,136 --> 01:15:05,154
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

1509
01:15:05,188 --> 01:15:08,386
I figured Mark, Dustin and the
new interns could work on the site.

1510
01:15:08,387 --> 01:15:11,010
While I was on generating
advertiser interest in New York.

1511
01:15:11,043 --> 01:15:15,413
But mostly I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

1512
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:17,904
Go, go, go, go, go...

1513
01:15:17,905 --> 01:15:19,823
Aaargh...

1514
01:15:23,184 --> 01:15:24,623
- I didn't die.
- I know.

1515
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,255
- I made it.
- You did.

1516
01:15:28,078 --> 01:15:29,422
Ok, ready?

1517
01:15:29,423 --> 01:15:30,382
That was like an eight.

1518
01:15:30,384 --> 01:15:31,342
That was like a two.

1519
01:15:31,344 --> 01:15:33,262
- It was better than that.
- Yeah.

1520
01:15:41,903 --> 01:15:43,810
- I'm ok.
- You sure?

1521
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:44,966
Yeah.

1522
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:45,908
Yikes.

1523
01:15:47,347 --> 01:15:48,775
That's the doorbell.

1524
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:49,944
I didn't know we had a door bell.

1525
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:50,898
Andrew get the door.

1526
01:15:50,899 --> 01:15:52,663
No, he's wired in.

1527
01:15:52,664 --> 01:15:53,623
That's gonna cut into the security deposit.

1528
01:15:56,597 --> 01:15:57,672
Andrew...
Not now.

1529
01:15:57,706 --> 01:15:58,748
Good boy

1530
01:16:02,972 --> 01:16:04,507
- Sean
- Mark.

1531
01:16:04,573 --> 01:16:06,813
- Do you live here?
- Yeah. Do you?

1532
01:16:06,814 --> 01:16:08,590
We were right across the
street, we saw the chimney...

1533
01:16:08,622 --> 01:16:08,954
Yeah.

1534
01:16:08,988 --> 01:16:09,954
Is anybody hurt?

1535
01:16:09,988 --> 01:16:12,984
No. You live across the street.

1536
01:16:13,019 --> 01:16:14,132
I'm Sharon.

1537
01:16:14,167 --> 01:16:17,551
This is my... Sharon. She lives across the street
and I was helping her move out, we saw the chimney...

1538
01:16:17,585 --> 01:16:20,259
Yeah, we had a zip line to the pool.

1539
01:16:20,292 --> 01:16:23,238
You came to California.

1540
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:24,613
Yeah.

1541
01:16:24,645 --> 01:16:26,689
You made the right choice.

1542
01:16:32,335 --> 01:16:33,563
Here you go.

1543
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:38,354
Sharon.

1544
01:16:40,778 --> 01:16:42,079
- I'm so sorry.
- No problem

1545
01:16:42,081 --> 01:16:43,039
I don't know you're gonna...

1546
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:44,420
- Here you go.
- No, no, wait...

1547
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:50,885
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

1548
01:16:50,918 --> 01:16:52,149
I'm Sean Parker.

1549
01:16:52,182 --> 01:16:53,346
Oh, he's wired in.

1550
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:56,599
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1551
01:16:56,631 --> 01:16:58,139
Where's Eduardo?

1552
01:16:58,171 --> 01:17:00,840
He got an internship in New York.

1553
01:17:00,872 --> 01:17:03,143
Eduardo didn't come out?

1554
01:17:22,614 --> 01:17:24,725
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things.

1555
01:17:25,014 --> 01:17:29,039
But she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents place.

1556
01:17:29,073 --> 01:17:30,916
Homeless rockstar of Palo Alto.

1557
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:31,876
Alright.

1558
01:17:31,877 --> 01:17:33,506
What your plan for the summer?

1559
01:17:35,329 --> 01:17:37,054
Mark.

1560
01:17:37,342 --> 01:17:40,404
I'm sorry, I was looking
at the architecture.

1561
01:17:40,404 --> 01:17:41,497
I asked, "what's your plan for the summer?"

1562
01:17:41,497 --> 01:17:43,033
I hit school by the end of the summer.

1563
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,984
- I'm going to the rest room
- Okay.

1564
01:17:44,984 --> 01:17:45,944
I'll go with you.

1565
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,225
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1566
01:17:52,259 --> 01:17:53,610
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1567
01:17:53,645 --> 01:17:55,139
What do you mean?

1568
01:17:57,225 --> 01:18:00,269
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie.

1569
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:03,587
But he's too embarrassed to shop
for it at a department store.

1570
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:07,333
He comes up with an idea for a high end place
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1571
01:18:07,368 --> 01:18:11,047
He gets a $40,000 bank loan, borrows
another $40,000 from his in-laws,

1572
01:18:11,081 --> 01:18:14,413
Opens a store, and calls it Victoria's Secret.

1573
01:18:14,448 --> 01:18:18,537
Makes a half million dollars his first year.
He starts a catalog, opens three more stores

1574
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:23,949
And after five years he sells the company to Leslie
Wexner and the Limited for four million dollars.

1575
01:18:23,983 --> 01:18:25,163
Happy ending, right?

1576
01:18:25,164 --> 01:18:29,600
Except two years later,
the company's worth 500 million dollars.

1577
01:18:29,632 --> 01:18:32,780
And Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

1578
01:18:35,217 --> 01:18:38,203
Poor guy just wanted to buy
his wife a pair of thigh highs.

1579
01:18:39,547 --> 01:18:41,082
W- Was that a parable?

1580
01:18:41,355 --> 01:18:45,108
My date is a Victoria Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1581
01:18:45,783 --> 01:18:47,536
Don't be impressed by all of this.

1582
01:18:47,569 --> 01:18:48,689
I read your blog.

1583
01:18:48,722 --> 01:18:50,920
Oh, oh you don't know.
Thats for webprints.

1584
01:18:51,257 --> 01:18:53,039
You know how I started Napster.

1585
01:18:53,073 --> 01:18:55,077
Girl I love in high school.

1586
01:18:55,078 --> 01:18:57,823
Was with the co-captain of
The Varsity Lacrosse team

1587
01:18:57,823 --> 01:18:59,608
And I wanted to take her from him

1588
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:02,131
So I decided to come up to next big things.

1589
01:19:02,164 --> 01:19:03,127
I didn't know that.

1590
01:19:03,161 --> 01:19:04,706
Napster wasn't the faillure...

1591
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:07,979
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.

1592
01:19:08,012 --> 01:19:11,740
They might not have been a good
business but it piss a lot of people off.

1593
01:19:11,774 --> 01:19:15,953
And this now what your facemash was about,
they scare of me pal,

1594
01:19:15,954 --> 01:19:17,489
And they're gonna be scare to you.

1595
01:19:17,490 --> 01:19:21,592
What the VCs wanna to say, good idea kid,
grown up so we could take it from here.

1596
01:19:21,592 --> 01:19:25,059
But not this time, this is our time.

1597
01:19:25,091 --> 01:19:25,990
This time...

1598
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:28,233
You gonna hand them a business card
that says,

1599
01:19:28,234 --> 01:19:31,372
I'm a CEO... bitch.

1600
01:19:31,407 --> 01:19:33,965
That's what I want from you.

1601
01:19:33,998 --> 01:19:35,853
Where the hell was Eduardo?

1602
01:19:35,886 --> 01:19:37,324
He's in New York.

1603
01:19:37,326 --> 01:19:38,667
Suckin' up...

1604
01:19:39,153 --> 01:19:41,128
- He's got...
- An internship.

1605
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:45,328
The company's here.
A billion dollar company is here.

1606
01:19:46,033 --> 01:19:48,023
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

1607
01:19:48,056 --> 01:19:49,212
I know you do.

1608
01:19:49,213 --> 01:19:52,309
Eduardo want to be a businessman
for all I know he's gonna be a good one,

1609
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:55,188
But he shouldn't be in New York.
Kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1610
01:19:56,533 --> 01:19:59,988
This isn't once of a generation holy shit idea.

1611
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:04,048
And the water under
the golden gate is freezing cold.

1612
01:20:05,501 --> 01:20:08,662
Look at me face, tell me
I don't know what I talkin' about.

1613
01:20:11,043 --> 01:20:12,675
Do you ever thinkin' about that girl...

1614
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:14,025
What girl?

1615
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:17,766
The girl from high school
with the Lacrosse team.

1616
01:20:18,502 --> 01:20:19,434
No.

1617
01:20:22,355 --> 01:20:24,052
Hundred of schools by the end of the summer?

1618
01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:24,655
Yup.

1619
01:20:24,849 --> 01:20:26,587
I tell you what, gesture of a good faith.

1620
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:30,438
While you're getting into a hundred schools,
I put you on two continents.

1621
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:33,652
Two continents.

1622
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:38,963
If you don't get a place to crash,

1623
01:20:38,965 --> 01:20:40,903
I think you should definitely
come in live with us.

1624
01:20:41,939 --> 01:20:43,809
Let's line-up some shots.

1625
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:44,769
Excuse me...

1626
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:49,229
- Yes, Sir.
- You can take this away and bring back the 1942.

1627
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:51,256
Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

1628
01:22:40,851 --> 01:22:42,194
- Mr. Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

1629
01:22:42,195 --> 01:22:44,108
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

1630
01:22:44,141 --> 01:22:45,502
And this is my brother, Cameron.

1631
01:22:45,534 --> 01:22:47,610
Excellence.

1632
01:22:47,645 --> 01:22:51,072
His Royal Highness, Prince Albert.
Sir, this is Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

1633
01:22:51,104 --> 01:22:54,153
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

1634
01:22:54,154 --> 01:22:54,953
Yes, Sir.
Of course.

1635
01:22:54,953 --> 01:22:58,474
My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one
of the premiere rowers of his day.

1636
01:22:58,475 --> 01:23:00,394
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years.

1637
01:23:00,395 --> 01:23:02,314
And I've never seen the race that close.

1638
01:23:02,314 --> 01:23:04,328
Have you seen a race that close?
No, your Highness.

1639
01:23:04,328 --> 01:23:07,207
Mile and a half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.

1640
01:23:07,207 --> 01:23:10,159
Yes, that's absolutely right.
Brutally close.

1641
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:11,365
May I introduce my team mates...

1642
01:23:11,399 --> 01:23:13,206
I'm sorry you have to excuse us...
Until the Beijing.

1643
01:23:16,764 --> 01:23:19,641
So you flew out here to see that?

1644
01:23:19,643 --> 01:23:20,601
Wouldn't miss you brother.

1645
01:23:20,603 --> 01:23:21,310
How was the royalty?

1646
01:23:21,342 --> 01:23:23,060
I just want him to tell
me couple more times,

1647
01:23:23,061 --> 01:23:26,435
How close the race was just brutal,
brutally-brutally- excruciating.

1648
01:23:26,436 --> 01:23:30,322
Cam. The guy's the prince of a country the
size of East Hampton. Relax. Its fine...

1649
01:23:30,355 --> 01:23:31,344
- Boys.
- Dad

1650
01:23:31,377 --> 01:23:32,716
Mr. Winklevoss.

1651
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:33,684
That was a tough beat.

1652
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:35,391
I'm sorry You and Mom flew
all over here to see that.

1653
01:23:35,425 --> 01:23:40,314
Don't ever apologize to me for losing a race like that.
Don't ever apologize to anyone for losing a race like that.

1654
01:23:40,346 --> 01:23:41,338
Boys.

1655
01:23:41,372 --> 01:23:42,333
Mr. Kenwright.

1656
01:23:42,368 --> 01:23:45,270
Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright,
head of the host family this week.

1657
01:23:45,304 --> 01:23:46,784
Pleasure to meet you.
Good to meet you.

1658
01:23:46,819 --> 01:23:49,896
I just had a phone chat with my daughter.

1659
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:51,659
She told me that she and her friends
are all talking about the race,

1660
01:23:51,661 --> 01:23:53,198
Which they just seen by the computer.

1661
01:23:53,615 --> 01:23:57,046
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

1662
01:23:59,306 --> 01:24:01,779
I'm going to find your mother...

1663
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:04,045
is it something wrong?

1664
01:24:04,078 --> 01:24:05,591
Your daughter doesn't go to school in States?

1665
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:09,677
No, no. Cambridge. Majoring in French Literature,
though I wasn't aware these was such a thing.

1666
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:10,485
They have Facebook at Cambridge?

1667
01:24:10,487 --> 01:24:14,192
And apparently Oxford and the London School of
Economics because that's where her friends are.

1668
01:24:14,385 --> 01:24:15,152
It's awesome.

1669
01:24:15,997 --> 01:24:17,341
Good race, boys.

1670
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,140
I'm gonna go to rest room.

1671
01:24:26,314 --> 01:24:28,347
This is online.
I want to see it.

1672
01:24:28,349 --> 01:24:29,115
Stop it.

1673
01:24:30,077 --> 01:24:31,470
Stop it, Cam.

1674
01:24:32,078 --> 01:24:33,738
Knock it off.

1675
01:24:34,251 --> 01:24:36,720
I don't mind that we loss by
the Dutch today by less than a second.

1676
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,998
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.

1677
01:24:39,033 --> 01:24:39,850
And they'll see us again.

1678
01:24:39,884 --> 01:24:42,470
What I mind and what you should mind,

1679
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:46,207
is showing up on Monday for
race which run on Sunday.

1680
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,078
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter,

1681
01:24:48,078 --> 01:24:51,448
We tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the University.

1682
01:24:51,483 --> 01:24:53,935
Now I'm asking you.
For the last time.

1683
01:24:53,935 --> 01:24:59,265
Let's take the considerable resources at
our disposal and sue him in a federal court.

1684
01:24:59,298 --> 01:25:01,167
Come on...

1685
01:25:01,775 --> 01:25:03,034
I need a real drink.

1686
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:11,639
Screw it,

1687
01:25:12,694 --> 01:25:14,902
Let gut that friggin nerd.

1688
01:25:17,398 --> 01:25:18,740
That's what I'm talking about.

1689
01:25:20,938 --> 01:25:23,305
But check it out, I saw him today

1690
01:25:23,338 --> 01:25:26,654
Manningham, Mitchel Manningham,
my Chase Equity...

1691
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:28,570
Are you guys using spike or ghost, miss?

1692
01:25:28,604 --> 01:25:30,273
We don't know, we're just
shooting at each other.

1693
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:31,859
Use sweet kamikaze.

1694
01:25:31,891 --> 01:25:33,412
Like we know what that is.

1695
01:25:33,704 --> 01:25:36,998
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera,
and he saw me too,

1696
01:25:37,703 --> 01:25:38,890
I know he did.

1697
01:25:42,157 --> 01:25:44,417
Don't sweat it...

1698
01:25:44,452 --> 01:25:45,539
Bong hit.

1699
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:48,090
Is anybody hear that banging?

1700
01:25:48,123 --> 01:25:50,358
You don't hear anything,
you are writing code.

1701
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:51,912
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1702
01:25:51,912 --> 01:25:54,600
It's not a dish best serves cold.

1703
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,711
It's best serves immediately and

1704
01:26:00,551 --> 01:26:02,694
I'm gonna call you back.

1705
01:26:04,037 --> 01:26:05,921
- What's up
- What's up?

1706
01:26:08,194 --> 01:26:09,958
Mark was supposed to pick me
up at the airport an hour ago,

1707
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,469
I've been calling his cell.

1708
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:14,882
He was on a 36 hour coding tear
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1709
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:22,867
What happened here?

1710
01:26:22,868 --> 01:26:26,359
Not happened... happening.
The next big thing.

1711
01:26:26,394 --> 01:26:27,849
Wardo!

1712
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:28,636
Hey man.

1713
01:26:28,636 --> 01:26:30,140
- Back to work.
- Ok.

1714
01:26:39,085 --> 01:26:40,117
How old are they, Sean?

1715
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:41,555
It's not polite to ask.

1716
01:26:41,556 --> 01:26:43,003
Sean, how old are they?

1717
01:26:44,456 --> 01:26:45,688
You think you know me, right?

1718
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,005
I've read enough.

1719
01:26:47,038 --> 01:26:48,462
You know how much I've read about you?

1720
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:51,604
Nothing.

1721
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:55,867
Wardo.

1722
01:26:56,369 --> 01:26:58,322
I waited an hour for you at the airport.

1723
01:26:58,355 --> 01:26:59,648
What time is it?

1724
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,877
It's midnight. Or 3AM in New
York where I just came from.

1725
01:27:02,911 --> 01:27:04,596
You've gotta see some of
the new stuff we've got.

1726
01:27:04,694 --> 01:27:07,128
Hey, Dustin, show him the wall.
I'm just calling it the wall.

1727
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:09,563
Forget the wall, tell him about
the meeting I've got set up.

1728
01:27:09,596 --> 01:27:11,778
- You know Peter Thiel?
- No.

1729
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:12,591
No reason you should.

1730
01:27:12,626 --> 01:27:17,479
He just run a two billion dollar
hedge fund called Clarium Capital.

1731
01:27:17,512 --> 01:27:18,793
Why's he setting up meetings?

1732
01:27:18,795 --> 01:27:19,850
Thiel may want to make an angel investment.

1733
01:27:19,851 --> 01:27:22,953
I don't care if he's an actual angel,
why's he setting up business meetings?

1734
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:23,891
You've had a long flight.

1735
01:27:23,893 --> 01:27:25,648
No, I've had long wait
on the Tarmac at JFK,

1736
01:27:25,649 --> 01:27:27,962
Then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone at SFO,

1737
01:27:27,963 --> 01:27:29,511
And in between there was a long flight.

1738
01:27:29,546 --> 01:27:32,051
I'm the business end of this company,

1739
01:27:32,341 --> 01:27:34,560
He's a house guest living here rent-free.

1740
01:27:34,752 --> 01:27:37,822
On a very generous grant from
Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1741
01:27:37,823 --> 01:27:42,228
I heard about you big ticket advice,
Gerry's tuxedos, Harvard Bartending Course.

1742
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:45,391
You're just one small step away from
bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

1743
01:27:54,413 --> 01:27:55,876
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?

1744
01:27:55,908 --> 01:27:56,831
Sure.

1745
01:28:01,177 --> 01:28:03,748
Bong hit!

1746
01:28:05,627 --> 01:28:10,417
How's it going? How's the internship?
How's Christy?

1747
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:11,737
How's the internship?

1748
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:12,877
Yeah.

1749
01:28:14,207 --> 01:28:16,104
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

1750
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:20,274
We've talked about this on the
phone, we... I quit on my first day.

1751
01:28:20,306 --> 01:28:22,457
I do remember you saying that.

1752
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:23,889
So, how's Christy?

1753
01:28:24,818 --> 01:28:26,203
She's crazy.

1754
01:28:26,204 --> 01:28:27,152
Is that fun?

1755
01:28:27,153 --> 01:28:31,251
No. She's actually psychotic.
She's insanely jealous,

1756
01:28:31,252 --> 01:28:34,774
She's irrational and
I'm frightening of her.

1757
01:28:34,807 --> 01:28:37,179
Still, it's nice to have a girlfriend.

1758
01:28:39,565 --> 01:28:42,838
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

1759
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:45,570
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1760
01:28:45,572 --> 01:28:48,000
- Did you hear what I just said?
- The connections, the energy...

1761
01:28:48,033 --> 01:28:48,777
Mark...

1762
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:50,907
I'm afraid if you not come out here.
You gonna left behind.

1763
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,971
I want, I want, I need you.

1764
01:28:53,005 --> 01:28:54,556
Out here, please don't tell me...

1765
01:28:54,557 --> 01:28:55,789
What you just say?

1766
01:28:55,823 --> 01:28:58,382
Its moving faster than
any of us ever imagine...

1767
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:00,081
It's moving fast then Sean think...

1768
01:29:00,082 --> 01:29:01,100
Sean is not part of this company.

1769
01:29:01,101 --> 01:29:03,061
We've got over 300.000 members,
we're in 160 schools...

1770
01:29:03,063 --> 01:29:03,740
I'm aware of that.

1771
01:29:03,742 --> 01:29:04,350
Including five in Europe...

1772
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:07,625
- I'm aware of that, Mark, I'm the CFO.
- We need more servers than I ever imagined...

1773
01:29:07,658 --> 01:29:09,222
We need more programmers.
And we need more money.

1774
01:29:09,256 --> 01:29:11,798
He set up the Thiel meeting.
He's set up meetings all over town.

1775
01:29:11,832 --> 01:29:13,082
He's set up other meetings?
Yes.

1776
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:14,011
Without me knowing anything about it?!

1777
01:29:14,045 --> 01:29:14,524
You're in New York!

1778
01:29:14,525 --> 01:29:18,326
I'm in New York riding subways
14 hours a day try to find our...

1779
01:29:18,327 --> 01:29:20,135
And how's it going so far?!

1780
01:29:24,284 --> 01:29:27,037
What did you mean get left behind?

1781
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:31,978
Can I help you?

1782
01:29:31,979 --> 01:29:36,983
I'd like to freeze this bank account and
cancel all existing checks and lines of credit.

1783
01:29:39,029 --> 01:29:41,204
May I see some ID please.

1784
01:29:48,185 --> 01:29:50,413
- Sean they will be right with you...
- No problem.

1785
01:29:52,614 --> 01:29:54,855
You know this is where they
filmed Towering Inferno.

1786
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:56,591
That's comforting.

1787
01:29:58,436 --> 01:29:59,514
Guys... come at my back.

1788
01:30:01,009 --> 01:30:03,104
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah we're cool.

1789
01:30:05,064 --> 01:30:06,592
Come on in... You must be Mark.

1790
01:30:06,626 --> 01:30:08,229
Hi.

1791
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:11,641
We took a look everything
and congratulations.

1792
01:30:11,676 --> 01:30:16,068
We're gonna start you off
with a $500.000 investment.

1793
01:30:16,771 --> 01:30:20,426
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

1794
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:22,556
We'll file as a Corporation
in Delaware and come up...

1795
01:30:22,557 --> 01:30:24,654
With a stock structure
to allow for new investors in.

1796
01:30:24,689 --> 01:30:27,541
Now lemme ask you something.

1797
01:30:27,573 --> 01:30:30,391
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1798
01:30:49,045 --> 01:30:50,003
Jesus chris...

1799
01:30:53,844 --> 01:30:54,704
When did you get back?

1800
01:30:54,738 --> 01:30:56,000
You scared me. I need you to knock.

1801
01:30:56,001 --> 01:30:58,274
When-did-you-get-back?

1802
01:30:59,233 --> 01:31:01,061
I got back this afternoon.

1803
01:31:01,095 --> 01:31:02,573
And when you gonna call me?

1804
01:31:02,606 --> 01:31:05,480
Chris... it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired and...

1805
01:31:05,515 --> 01:31:09,162
Or answer one of my 47 texts?
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

1806
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:12,813
I did and I thought that was
incredibly normal behavior.

1807
01:31:12,845 --> 01:31:14,090
Are you mocking me?

1808
01:31:14,123 --> 01:31:16,335
I brought you a present.

1809
01:31:17,354 --> 01:31:19,636
Why does your status say
"single" on your Facebook page?

1810
01:31:19,670 --> 01:31:21,386
What?

1811
01:31:21,421 --> 01:31:24,993
Why does your relationship status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

1812
01:31:24,993 --> 01:31:26,436
I was single when I set up the page.

1813
01:31:26,438 --> 01:31:27,846
And you just never
bothered to change it?

1814
01:31:28,039 --> 01:31:28,423
I...

1815
01:31:28,425 --> 01:31:29,814
What?!

1816
01:31:29,847 --> 01:31:31,534
I don't know how.

1817
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:33,206
Do I look stupid to you?

1818
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:34,559
No. Calm down.

1819
01:31:34,591 --> 01:31:36,994
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook,

1820
01:31:36,996 --> 01:31:39,143
Doesn't know how to change his
relationship status on Facebook?

1821
01:31:39,144 --> 01:31:42,583
It's a little embarrassing so you should take it
as as sign of trust that I would tell you that.

1822
01:31:42,617 --> 01:31:43,456
Go to hell.

1823
01:31:43,489 --> 01:31:44,118
Take it easy.

1824
01:31:44,152 --> 01:31:47,771
You didn't change it so you could screw those
Silicon Valley slut every time you go out to see Mark.

1825
01:31:47,805 --> 01:31:48,840
That is not ever remotely
true and I can promise you...

1826
01:31:49,511 --> 01:31:53,804
That the Silicon Valley Slut don't care what
anyone's relationship status is on Facebook.

1827
01:31:53,837 --> 01:31:55,411
Please open your present.

1828
01:31:55,444 --> 01:31:56,554
Your phone does work.

1829
01:31:58,342 --> 01:31:59,771
It's Mark.

1830
01:31:59,805 --> 01:32:02,907
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1831
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:06,009
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1832
01:32:06,042 --> 01:32:06,916
This'll be your first.

1833
01:32:08,295 --> 01:32:08,756
You froze our account?

1834
01:32:08,788 --> 01:32:10,023
I did.

1835
01:32:10,056 --> 01:32:11,225
You froze the account.

1836
01:32:11,257 --> 01:32:12,356
I had to get your attention, Mark.

1837
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:13,891
Do you realize that you
jeopardized the entire company?

1838
01:32:13,893 --> 01:32:16,865
Do you realize that your actions could've permanently
destroyed everything I've been working on?

1839
01:32:16,899 --> 01:32:17,417
WE've been working on.

1840
01:32:17,417 --> 01:32:19,100
Without money, the site can't function.

1841
01:32:19,135 --> 01:32:22,590
Ok let me tell you the different between
Facebook and everybody else, we don't crash ever.

1842
01:32:22,591 --> 01:32:26,112
If the servers are down for even a day,
our entire reputation is irreversibly destroy.

1843
01:32:26,145 --> 01:32:26,601
Look...

1844
01:32:26,636 --> 01:32:28,179
Seriously, I think Friendster prove that!

1845
01:32:28,212 --> 01:32:31,278
Even a few people leaving would
reverberate through the entire user base.

1846
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:33,537
The users are interconnected,
that's the whole point!

1847
01:32:33,572 --> 01:32:35,194
College kids are online because
their friends are online.

1848
01:32:35,195 --> 01:32:37,801
And if one domino goes,
the other dominoes go!

1849
01:32:37,801 --> 01:32:40,091
I'm not going back
to the Carribean Night at A-E-Pi.

1850
01:32:40,126 --> 01:32:44,101
Holy shit...!

1851
01:32:46,386 --> 01:32:47,128
What's wrong with you!

1852
01:32:47,162 --> 01:32:48,875
Did you like being nobody?!

1853
01:32:48,876 --> 01:32:50,586
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?!

1854
01:32:50,619 --> 01:32:51,917
Hang on, hang on...

1855
01:32:51,951 --> 01:32:54,717
That was the act of a child, not a decent man.
And it truly wasn't the act of a friend.

1856
01:32:54,752 --> 01:32:58,645
You know how embarrassed I was
when I tried to cash a check today?

1857
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:00,878
I'm not going back to that life.
Maybe you were frustrated.

1858
01:33:00,912 --> 01:33:03,479
- Maybe you were angry,
- I was.

1859
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:07,963
But I'm willing to let bygones be
bygones because I've got a good news.

1860
01:33:07,965 --> 01:33:12,670
Look, I'm sorry.
I was angry and maybe it was childish.

1861
01:33:12,703 --> 01:33:15,671
But I had to get your attention.

1862
01:33:15,703 --> 01:33:17,613
Eduardo, I said I've got some good news.

1863
01:33:17,645 --> 01:33:18,386
What is it?

1864
01:33:18,421 --> 01:33:20,895
Peter Thiel just made an angel
investment of a half million dollars.

1865
01:33:20,927 --> 01:33:21,921
What?
half million dollars

1866
01:33:21,953 --> 01:33:26,177
And he's setting us up in an office.

1867
01:33:26,212 --> 01:33:27,731
They want to re-incorporate the company,

1868
01:33:27,733 --> 01:33:30,403
They want to meet you and they need
your signature on some documents.

1869
01:33:30,436 --> 01:33:34,029
So get your ass on the first flight
back to San Fransisco. I need my CFO.

1870
01:33:39,465 --> 01:33:40,332
I'm on my way.

1871
01:33:40,775 --> 01:33:41,876
Wardo.
Yeah.

1872
01:33:41,909 --> 01:33:43,140
We did it.

1873
01:33:46,372 --> 01:33:47,139
Wardo,

1874
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,009
You're going back there already?

1875
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:51,810
Yes.

1876
01:33:52,983 --> 01:33:55,453
And also I'm breaking up with you.

1877
01:34:03,014 --> 01:34:05,784
Four documents. These first two are
common stock purchase agreements,

1878
01:34:05,819 --> 01:34:08,766
Allowing you to buy stock in the
newly re-incorporated Facebook

1879
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:11,908
as supposed the old share
which is now worthless.

1880
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:13,243
The third is the exchange agreement,

1881
01:34:13,244 --> 01:34:15,908
Allowing you to exchanges
the old shares for new shares,

1882
01:34:15,908 --> 01:34:17,997
and then finally voter
holding agreement.

1883
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:20,283
How many shares of stock will I own?

1884
01:34:20,438 --> 01:34:22,706
1.328.334

1885
01:34:22,738 --> 01:34:24,939
Jesus Christ.

1886
01:34:24,974 --> 01:34:29,918
That's a 34,4% ownership share.
Why they increase from the original 30%?

1887
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:33,898
Because you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

1888
01:34:33,931 --> 01:34:35,396
I love working with business majors.

1889
01:34:35,398 --> 01:34:36,645
Economics.

1890
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:41,484
You should know that Mark's already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

1891
01:34:42,511 --> 01:34:46,091
Well, Mark doesn't care about
money and he needs to be protected.

1892
01:34:48,136 --> 01:34:53,654
Dustin Moskowitz owns 6,81%,
Sean Parker 6,47%

1893
01:34:55,728 --> 01:34:56,243
I can live with that.

1894
01:34:56,278 --> 01:34:58,685
And Peter Theil 7%

1895
01:35:01,858 --> 01:35:04,942
Would you like to use my pen?

1896
01:35:04,975 --> 01:35:07,585
Eduardo?

1897
01:35:09,434 --> 01:35:10,067
Can you please repeat the question?

1898
01:35:10,067 --> 01:35:12,369
No. It was an outrageously
leading question, the first time.

1899
01:35:12,371 --> 01:35:13,775
Now you want to hear it twice?

1900
01:35:13,810 --> 01:35:15,182
Would you re-read that please?

1901
01:35:15,216 --> 01:35:16,914
Go ahead.

1902
01:35:16,948 --> 01:35:18,557
And when you signed these documents,

1903
01:35:18,559 --> 01:35:21,342
Were you aware that you were
signing your own death certificate?

1904
01:35:21,377 --> 01:35:22,728
No.

1905
01:35:26,332 --> 01:35:30,402
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyer look over all the... uh,

1906
01:35:30,435 --> 01:35:33,149
In all honesty I thought
they were my lawyers.

1907
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:42,215
I was your only friend.
You had one friend.

1908
01:35:45,502 --> 01:35:47,037
My father won't even look at me.

1909
01:35:47,069 --> 01:35:51,353
Okay. Eduardo. Did Mr. Zuckerberg saying
anything to you after you signed the papers?

1910
01:35:51,386 --> 01:35:56,057
There was a lot of handshaking
and a lot of congratulations.

1911
01:35:56,091 --> 01:35:59,957
He'd already told me he wouldn't be coming
back to school for at least a semester.

1912
01:35:59,957 --> 01:36:03,567
So we were saying goodbye for a while.

1913
01:36:03,568 --> 01:36:04,774
And then before I left,
he said...

1914
01:36:04,775 --> 01:36:06,257
But you gotta come back.

1915
01:36:06,259 --> 01:36:08,409
Somewhere around the end
of November or early December.

1916
01:36:08,444 --> 01:36:10,711
Peter wanna throw us an amazing
party when we hit a million members,

1917
01:36:10,712 --> 01:36:13,051
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.

1918
01:36:13,085 --> 01:36:14,507
A million members.

1919
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:15,576
Yeah.

1920
01:36:15,609 --> 01:36:19,740
The algorithm on the window at Kirkland?

1921
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:21,346
Yeah.

1922
01:36:24,359 --> 01:36:26,295
Yeah, I'll be here.

1923
01:36:30,421 --> 01:36:32,536
- You sure about this?
- You're 20 mins late.

1924
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:35,128
You're gonna walk in there and say you overslept
and you didn't have time to get dressed.

1925
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:36,126
They're gonna pitch you.

1926
01:36:36,127 --> 01:36:39,073
Chase equity is going to pitch you.
They're gonna beg you to take their money.

1927
01:36:39,074 --> 01:36:43,752
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod, you're gonna nod
and then you're gonna say, "Which one of you is Ralph"

1928
01:36:43,752 --> 01:36:46,466
No, not Ralph... No Manningham.
Which one of you, Mitchel Manningham?

1929
01:36:46,498 --> 01:36:47,752
And he'll say I am.

1930
01:36:47,784 --> 01:36:52,070
Then you'll say, Sean Parker says "F*ck You."
Walk out.

1931
01:36:52,573 --> 01:36:53,364
Okay.

1932
01:37:05,996 --> 01:37:10,106
In late November I got the e-mail from Mark
telling me to come out for the millionth member party.

1933
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:11,868
What else did e-mail say?

1934
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:14,873
It said that we had to
have a business meeting.

1935
01:37:14,907 --> 01:37:18,698
That Mark and Sean had playing some
kind of revenge stunt to Chase Equity.

1936
01:37:18,731 --> 01:37:24,046
Manningham was so impressed that he was makin'
an investment offer that was hard to turn down.

1937
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:28,270
I went out to California and I
went straight to the New Offices.

1938
01:37:28,304 --> 01:37:34,951
I didn't know whether to dress for the party or
the business meeting so I kinda dressed for both.

1939
01:37:34,984 --> 01:37:35,716
But it didn't matter.

1940
01:37:35,716 --> 01:37:36,676
Why not?

1941
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:39,048
Because I wasn't called
out there for either one...

1942
01:37:39,082 --> 01:37:40,564
What were you called out there for?

1943
01:37:44,162 --> 01:37:45,893
An ambush.

1944
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:47,894
Mr. Saverin. Hi...

1945
01:37:58,884 --> 01:38:03,314
At first I thought he was joking,
giving me more contracts to sign.

1946
01:38:06,671 --> 01:38:09,279
But then I started reading.

1947
01:38:11,686 --> 01:38:13,894
What is this?

1948
01:38:13,926 --> 01:38:16,604
Well, as you know we had
some new investor that...

1949
01:38:16,637 --> 01:38:18,720
What is this?

1950
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:34,408
Mark...

1951
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:36,617
MARK...!

1952
01:38:36,618 --> 01:38:37,703
- He's wired in.
- Sorry

1953
01:38:37,737 --> 01:38:38,292
He's wired in.

1954
01:38:38,293 --> 01:38:38,773
- Is he?
- Yes.

1955
01:38:40,855 --> 01:38:42,689
How about now, you still wired in?

1956
01:38:42,722 --> 01:38:43,430
Call security!

1957
01:38:43,465 --> 01:38:46,801
You issued over 24-million
new shares of stock.

1958
01:38:46,835 --> 01:38:48,548
You were told that if new
investors came along...

1959
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:51,323
How much your shares are diluted?
How much are his?!

1960
01:38:51,324 --> 01:38:55,823
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

1961
01:38:55,858 --> 01:38:56,809
It wasn't.

1962
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:59,989
What was Mr. Moskowitz's
ownership share diluted down to?

1963
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:00,951
It wasn't.

1964
01:39:01,052 --> 01:39:04,443
What was Sean Parker's
ownership share diluted down to?

1965
01:39:04,444 --> 01:39:05,551
It wasn't.

1966
01:39:05,551 --> 01:39:08,337
What was Peter Thiels's
ownership share diluted down to?

1967
01:39:08,337 --> 01:39:09,536
It wasn't.

1968
01:39:09,537 --> 01:39:13,354
What was your ownership
share diluted down to?

1969
01:39:13,354 --> 01:39:15,445
Point-zero-three-percent.

1970
01:39:23,282 --> 01:39:24,743
You signed the papers.

1971
01:39:24,778 --> 01:39:25,927
You set me up.

1972
01:39:25,961 --> 01:39:28,140
You blame me because you were
the business head of the company,

1973
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:30,024
And you made a bad business
deal with your own company?!

1974
01:39:30,024 --> 01:39:31,641
It's gonna be like I'm not part of Facebook.

1975
01:39:31,643 --> 01:39:34,300
It won't be like you're not a part of Facebook,
You're not part of Facebook.

1976
01:39:34,332 --> 01:39:35,356
My name's on the masthead.

1977
01:39:35,390 --> 01:39:36,743
You may wanna check again.

1978
01:39:36,775 --> 01:39:38,117
This is because I froze the account?

1979
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:40,095
You think we were gonna let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits,

1980
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:41,554
Pretending you were running this company?

1981
01:39:41,587 --> 01:39:43,439
Sorry, my Prada is at the cleaners,

1982
01:39:43,471 --> 01:39:47,617
Along with my hoodie and my 'F*ck You' Flip-Flops,
you pretentious douche bag!

1983
01:39:47,618 --> 01:39:48,985
Security is here.
You'll be leaving now.

1984
01:39:48,987 --> 01:39:50,130
I'm not signing those papers.

1985
01:39:50,131 --> 01:39:52,193
We will get your signature.

1986
01:39:52,193 --> 01:39:54,695
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

1987
01:39:56,912 --> 01:40:00,853
You... you did it. I knew you did it.
You planted the story about the chicken.

1988
01:40:00,854 --> 01:40:02,405
I didn't planted the
story about the chicken.

1989
01:40:02,407 --> 01:40:04,365
What he talking about?

1990
01:40:04,367 --> 01:40:05,707
Seriously, what the hell with the chicken?

1991
01:40:05,707 --> 01:40:07,793
And I'll bet what you hated the most,

1992
01:40:07,795 --> 01:40:11,412
They said they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

1993
01:40:11,445 --> 01:40:14,199
Which I am!
You better lawyer-up, asshole,

1994
01:40:14,201 --> 01:40:20,240
'Cause I'm not comin' back for 30%
I'm comin' back for everything!

1995
01:40:24,555 --> 01:40:25,945
Get him outta here.

1996
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:28,167
It's okay. I'm going.

1997
01:40:29,256 --> 01:40:30,503
Hang on...

1998
01:40:32,702 --> 01:40:34,140
Almost forgot.

1999
01:40:35,101 --> 01:40:36,636
Here's your $19.000.

2000
01:40:36,637 --> 01:40:38,939
I wouldn't cash it though.
I drew it on the account you froze.

2001
01:40:44,029 --> 01:40:46,867
I like standing next to you, Sean.

2002
01:40:47,724 --> 01:40:50,117
It makes me look so tough.

2003
01:41:04,228 --> 01:41:05,368
That's it. That's our
show for tonight, people.

2004
01:41:07,131 --> 01:41:09,288
Look, I want to see everybody here
get geared up for a party.

2005
01:41:09,289 --> 01:41:11,636
We're gonna walk down to the
club like it's the Macy's Parade.

2006
01:41:11,670 --> 01:41:14,275
Mackey, put it up on the big
screen, we've gotta almost be there.

2007
01:41:17,744 --> 01:41:19,239
- You alright?
- Yeah.

2008
01:41:20,298 --> 01:41:22,117
You were kinda rough on him.

2009
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:24,189
That's life in the NFL.

2010
01:41:24,689 --> 01:41:26,159
No. You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2011
01:41:26,194 --> 01:41:27,631
Sean...

2012
01:41:29,344 --> 01:41:30,992
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2013
01:41:31,024 --> 01:41:32,605
He almost killed it!

2014
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:37,435
I'll send flowers.

2015
01:41:37,469 --> 01:41:42,135
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together
a party after party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

2016
01:41:42,136 --> 01:41:43,780
Ashleigh there's a sister.

2017
01:41:43,814 --> 01:41:44,765
Ashleigh.

2018
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:45,478
The Intern.

2019
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:47,399
I know who she is.

2020
01:41:47,431 --> 01:41:48,855
Are you guys?

2021
01:41:48,856 --> 01:41:50,791
Ashleigh and me... no...
A little bit.

2022
01:41:53,198 --> 01:41:54,082
Why?

2023
01:41:54,115 --> 01:41:55,920
Excuse me, Mark.

2024
01:41:55,953 --> 01:41:57,524
We were just talkin' about you,

2025
01:41:57,557 --> 01:41:59,425
You're doing a really good job.

2026
01:41:59,791 --> 01:42:01,657
Thanks. I appreciate that.

2027
01:42:02,905 --> 01:42:03,844
This came in for you.

2028
01:42:03,877 --> 01:42:06,682
Put on my desk.

2029
01:42:12,069 --> 01:42:13,820
What's the package.

2030
01:42:13,854 --> 01:42:15,572
Nothing.

2031
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:18,350
Mackey...

2032
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:18,921
Yes, Sir.

2033
01:42:18,921 --> 01:42:19,868
Refresh!

2034
01:42:28,171 --> 01:42:29,688
And you need a hugger, I know.

2035
01:42:33,865 --> 01:42:35,309
1 millions, who's got champagne?

2036
01:43:01,333 --> 01:43:04,751
The next transformative development
of picture sharing application.

2037
01:43:04,752 --> 01:43:07,631
A place that you view picture
and go share with your social life.

2038
01:43:07,631 --> 01:43:10,726
It is the true digitalization of your life.

2039
01:43:13,278 --> 01:43:16,885
You don't just go to a party anymore,
you go to a party with your digital camera,

2040
01:43:16,918 --> 01:43:20,400
And then your friends re-live the
party online. And tagging. The idea...

2041
01:43:20,435 --> 01:43:22,217
Would this be easier without the bra?

2042
01:43:22,251 --> 01:43:23,476
It's worth finding out.

2043
01:43:31,055 --> 01:43:32,846
Stop the music, now!

2044
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:39,594
I've spent hours...
watching what people do when they log on

2045
01:43:39,627 --> 01:43:41,301
They check friends status update,

2046
01:43:41,336 --> 01:43:42,224
That's weird, why the music off...

2047
01:43:42,225 --> 01:43:44,470
Checked to see which of their
friends had changed their profiles,

2048
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:45,373
Changed their photos and mostly...

2049
01:43:45,407 --> 01:43:46,942
Seriously, what happen with the music?

2050
01:43:46,943 --> 01:43:49,060
We lived on farms, and
then we lived in cities

2051
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:50,985
and now we're going to
live on the internet.

2052
01:43:50,987 --> 01:43:54,676
Sean. Stop, I think
something's goin' on downstairs.

2053
01:44:04,833 --> 01:44:06,176
Please... Time to go home!

2054
01:44:08,012 --> 01:44:09,279
Party is over.

2055
01:44:13,042 --> 01:44:14,149
It's the cops!

2056
01:44:14,184 --> 01:44:15,192
Shit.

2057
01:44:19,609 --> 01:44:21,314
Good to see you officer...
What can I do for you.

2058
01:44:22,856 --> 01:44:23,811
What's goin' on?

2059
01:44:23,845 --> 01:44:26,036
Was the music too loud?
We were havin' celebration.

2060
01:44:26,069 --> 01:44:27,795
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

2061
01:44:27,828 --> 01:44:29,524
I can tell them to turn the music down...

2062
01:44:34,135 --> 01:44:35,297
That's not mine.

2063
01:44:35,706 --> 01:44:38,609
Ok, we gonna need identification,
keep your hand where we can see 'em.

2064
01:44:40,153 --> 01:44:41,658
Anything else in your pocket,
I should know about?

2065
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:42,676
No, Sir.
No.

2066
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:45,143
- Don't be stupid now.
- I don't, I...

2067
01:44:49,694 --> 01:44:51,143
What this?

2068
01:44:51,176 --> 01:44:52,801
That's an Epipen.

2069
01:44:54,310 --> 01:44:56,457
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2070
01:44:57,335 --> 01:44:58,907
How old are you?

2071
01:45:02,847 --> 01:45:03,606
I'm 21

2072
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:06,030
Lying only would make it worst!

2073
01:45:06,646 --> 01:45:09,457
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2074
01:45:19,889 --> 01:45:23,891
- Hello?
- Listen, something's happen...

2075
01:45:30,186 --> 01:45:31,145
Shit.

2076
01:45:31,146 --> 01:45:33,796
It's alright, it's gonna be alright.
I've posted bond.

2077
01:45:33,828 --> 01:45:38,253
I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies...

2078
01:45:41,694 --> 01:45:44,488
- Interns...
- It was just a party

2079
01:45:46,795 --> 01:45:49,698
This gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online, any second.

2080
01:45:51,922 --> 01:45:52,993
I know.

2081
01:45:53,025 --> 01:45:53,851
You know with an intern...

2082
01:45:53,853 --> 01:45:56,122
It's cool, I have it under control

2083
01:45:56,122 --> 01:45:57,037
I will get it under control.

2084
01:45:57,878 --> 01:46:00,239
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

2085
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:02,465
But this gonna be news now.

2086
01:46:02,471 --> 01:46:04,351
You don't think Eduardo was involve, do you?

2087
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:06,333
- Do you think?
- No.

2088
01:46:07,519 --> 01:46:12,260
Or Manningham, one of them, somebody,
somebody sent the cocain there, 'cause it got in there.

2089
01:46:12,261 --> 01:46:14,179
You believe me, it's gonna be fine...

2090
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:18,979
Right?

2091
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:25,552
Go home Sean.

2092
01:46:38,177 --> 01:46:39,136
Mark...

2093
01:46:42,016 --> 01:46:42,975
Mark...

2094
01:46:44,896 --> 01:46:46,859
We're done for the day

2095
01:46:46,893 --> 01:46:49,875
Yeah, I was just sittin'...

2096
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:54,899
What happened to Sean?

2097
01:46:54,932 --> 01:46:57,250
He still owns 7% of the company.

2098
01:47:01,506 --> 01:47:04,443
All you had all day only was that salad,
you wanna get something to eat?

2099
01:47:04,476 --> 01:47:06,993
I can't.

2100
01:47:13,859 --> 01:47:15,462
I'm not a bad guy.

2101
01:47:15,463 --> 01:47:16,404
I know that.

2102
01:47:17,171 --> 01:47:20,203
Under emotional testimony,
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.

2103
01:47:21,163 --> 01:47:22,122
- And the other 15?
- Purgery

2104
01:47:23,578 --> 01:47:25,002
Creations myth needs a devil.

2105
01:47:28,587 --> 01:47:29,515
What happens now?

2106
01:47:30,917 --> 01:47:35,185
Sy and the others are having
a steak on University Avenue.

2107
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:37,019
Then they'll come back up to the office...

2108
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:39,524
And start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.

2109
01:47:40,064 --> 01:47:41,032
They're gonna settle?

2110
01:47:41,033 --> 01:47:43,779
Oh yeah... and you're gonna
have to pay a little extra.

2111
01:47:44,164 --> 01:47:44,773
Why?

2112
01:47:44,773 --> 01:47:47,403
So that these guy sign an
non-disclosure agreement.

2113
01:47:47,404 --> 01:47:50,315
They say one unflattering word about you
in public, you own their wife and kids.

2114
01:47:51,231 --> 01:47:52,211
I invented Facebook

2115
01:47:52,432 --> 01:47:54,210
I'm talking about what a jury.

2116
01:47:54,243 --> 01:47:56,759
I specialize in voir dire...
Jury selection.

2117
01:47:56,792 --> 01:47:58,472
What a jury sees when
they look at the defendant.

2118
01:47:58,506 --> 01:48:01,637
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likability...

2119
01:48:01,671 --> 01:48:02,814
Like-ability?

2120
01:48:02,849 --> 01:48:05,753
I've been licensed to practice
law for all of 20 months.

2121
01:48:05,787 --> 01:48:06,854
And I can get the jury to believe...

2122
01:48:06,854 --> 01:48:09,456
That you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

2123
01:48:09,552 --> 01:48:10,511
Watch, what else?

2124
01:48:11,088 --> 01:48:13,873
Why weren't you at Sean's
sorority party that night?

2125
01:48:13,907 --> 01:48:15,073
You think I'm the one
that called the police?

2126
01:48:15,074 --> 01:48:17,922
Doesn't matter, I ask the question,
now everybody's think about it

2127
01:48:17,923 --> 01:48:20,292
You've lost your jury
in the first 10 mins.

2128
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:23,256
- Farm animals?
- Yeah.

2129
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:27,497
I was drunk, and angry and stupid.

2130
01:48:27,497 --> 01:48:29,595
- And blogging...
- and blogging.

2131
01:48:30,926 --> 01:48:35,194
Pay them, on the scheme of things.
It's a speeding ticket.

2132
01:48:36,846 --> 01:48:38,716
That what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2133
01:48:39,787 --> 01:48:42,409
Do you think anybody would mind if I
stay and use the computer for a minute...

2134
01:48:42,443 --> 01:48:43,988
I can't imagine that would be a problem.

2135
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:44,956
Thanks.

2136
01:48:46,194 --> 01:48:48,220
I appreciate your help today.

2137
01:48:52,067 --> 01:48:54,434
You're not an asshole Mark...

2138
01:48:55,408 --> 01:48:57,279
You're just trying so hard to be...

2139
01:49:52,868 --> 01:49:58,756
Cameroon and Tyler Winklevoss received a settlement of
65 million dollars and signed a non-disclosure agreement.

2140
01:50:02,533 --> 01:50:08,431
They rowed for the U.S. Olympic Team
in Beijing and placed sixth.

2141
01:50:19,050 --> 01:50:25,079
Eduardo Saverin received an unknown settlement. His name
has been restored to the Facebook masthead as a Co-Founder.

2142
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:34,180
Facebook has 500 million members in 207 countries.
It's currently valued at 25 billion dollars.

2143
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,667
Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest
billionaire in the world.
