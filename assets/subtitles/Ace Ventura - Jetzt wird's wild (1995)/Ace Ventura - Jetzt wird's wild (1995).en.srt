1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Negative. No sign.

2
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,500
Wait a second. I think I got him.

3
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,600
You know...

4
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,400
...you could put someone's eye out
with that thing.

5
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,200
We airlifted out the last passengers, Ace.
We're heading out.

6
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,400
What about the animal cargo?

7
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,400
Don't worry. It's just one little raccoon.
If I were you, I'd turn back.

8
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,400
If you were me, then I'd be you!

9
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,800
And I'd use your body to get to the top!

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,700
You can't stop me, no matter who you are!

11
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,600
Loser!

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,400
L-o-o-...

13
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,900
...s-e-r.

14
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,100
Hungry, fella?

15
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
That should hold you for a while.

16
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,500
That's okay, Spike.

17
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,400
There's nothing more we can do.

18
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,500
Look, Spike!

19
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,500
Do not fret, my woodland friend.

20
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,200
Your life is in the hands of Ace Ventura...

21
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,900
...Pet Detective.

22
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,700
Whatever you do...

23
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,700
...don't look down.

24
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,500
Hang on!

25
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,100
Hang on, little buddy!

26
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
I got you!

27
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,600
I think I got you!

28
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Maybe not.

29
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,700
You're slipping!

30
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't let go!

31
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,600
My goodness.

32
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,600
Hello.

33
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,600
That was quite a shock.

34
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
It's extremely nice to meet you.

35
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,900
My name is Fulton Greenwall...

36
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,800
...and I am looking for an Ace Ventura.

37
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,100
No man here...

38
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,000
...carries with him...

39
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
...a label.

40
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,600
What?

41
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,500
Oh, yes.

42
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,500
No names. How silly of me.

43
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,900
He's an American.

44
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,400
We are all children...

45
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,000
...of the same life force.

46
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,900
Yes, of course we are.

47
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,600
He bends over and speaks from his rear.

48
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,100
Oh, him.

49
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,700
Right this way.

50
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,200
He came to us a broken man.

51
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,700
He had lost the will
to sustain his existence.

52
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes, I heard about that
unfortunate accident with the raccoon.

53
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
It was terrible for him.

54
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,200
But the life force...

55
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,500
...once again...

56
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,300
...smiled upon him.

57
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,600
He's now...

58
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,100
...at peace.

59
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
I will wait here.

60
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,000
I must apologize.

61
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,500
Quite. Well, no harm done.

62
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,400
Let me introduce myself.

63
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,700
My name is Fulton Greenwall,
and I'm here to employ your services...

64
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
...in the retrieval of a lost animal.

65
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,300
Can you help us?

66
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,600
Your request is like your intestine.

67
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,100
Stinky...

68
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,700
...and dangerous.

69
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,600
We can pay handsomely.

70
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,800
I am now a child of light.

71
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,800
Your earthly money holds no appeal to me.

72
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,500
$20,000.

73
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,300
Really?

74
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
No.

75
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,500
I cannot.

76
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,400
For I am sorely needed...

77
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,100
...here...

78
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,300
...at the ashram.

79
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,200
May I interject?

80
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,200
We're short of space.

81
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
And it's important for you
to use your talents.

82
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
Let me help you pack.

83
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,000
But I have yet to attain
omnipresent super-galactic oneness.

84
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,700
Wait!

85
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,700
There it is!

86
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,100
You've just attained it.

87
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,800
I have?

88
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,500
Just now.

89
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,400
You are one!

90
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,700
I can see it in your eyes.

91
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,200
You're more one than anyone.

92
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,900
What about my medallion
of spiritual accomplishment?

93
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,100
Take mine.

94
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,100
This took you 80 years to achieve!

95
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,200
That's okay.

96
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,700
I don't like it anymore. Really.

97
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,000
In light of this personal sacrifice
you've made...

98
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
...l have no choice...

99
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,500
...but to take the case.

100
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,800
Great!

101
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,600
I'll tell the others.

102
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,300
Master!

103
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,100
Break it to them gently.

104
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
I've never seen them act like that before.

105
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,700
Denial can be an ugly thing.

106
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,000
We should go, Mr. Ventura.
I've arranged a plane.

107
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,100
I'll meet you at the bottom.

108
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,400
There's still one more thing
I must do before I go.

109
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,600
Isn't this incredible?

110
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,100
It's going to be some kind of record!

111
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,300
"Everyone loves a Slinky

112
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,600
"You got to get a Slinky."

113
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,900
Go, Slinky, go!

114
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,700
Oh, man!

115
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,400
Can you believe it?

116
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
It was right there!

117
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,800
Can I do it one more time?

118
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,600
Forgive me, but if we don't hurry,
we might miss the plane.

119
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,500
Of course.

120
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,700
How selfish of me.

121
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,200
Let's do all the things that you want to do.

122
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,800
Canadian moose during mating season.

123
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,200
And now...

124
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,200
...a yak.

125
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,600
Peanut?

126
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Yes, I have one right here!

127
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,000
It's bulky, but I consider it a carryon.

128
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,600
Peanuts?

129
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,600
Oh, I see!

130
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,700
If we can get back to business,
Mr. Ventura?

131
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,600
The Wachati are a peaceful tribe.

132
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Since their sacred animal has vanished...

133
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,000
...they believe that there is a curse fallen
on their village.

134
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,900
It all started some time ago when,
one night....

135
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,300
So, the daughter of the Wachati chief...

136
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,200
...is set to wed the first son
of the Wachootoo tribe.

137
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,800
And the sacred animal was offered
as dowry for the marriage.

138
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,100
But...

139
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,700
...if it is not recovered...

140
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,600
...the result will be...

141
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,800
...the merciless slaughter of the Wachati.

142
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,800
Mr. Ventura?

143
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,000
There's...

144
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,400
...someone on the wing.

145
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800
Some...

146
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,200
...thing!

147
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,900
I'm sorry, what did you say?

148
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,300
The daughter of the Wachati chief...

149
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,900
...is set to wed...

150
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,700
...the first son of the Wachootoo tribe.

151
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,900
Spectacular!

152
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,400
This land holds great beauty!

153
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,200
How far to the crime scene?

154
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,800
I'm to bring you first to the consulate...

155
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,900
...which is beyond the trees...

156
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,900
...on the other side of the jungle.
So, you'll have to circle around....

157
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,000
Steering's a bit loose!

158
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,300
Alignment's off!

159
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,700
"Oh, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

160
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,200
"We love you

161
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,100
"And our pretty Chitty Chitty
Bang Bang loves us, too

162
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,900
"On Chitty Chitty Bang Bang we depend

163
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,400
"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
our fine four-fendered friend."

164
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,700
There's the consulate!

165
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,300
Oh, thank God!

166
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,900
If I can just find a parking spot....

167
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,000
Perhaps we should slow down
just a teensy bit.

168
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
Nonsense, poopy pants!

169
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,400
We're going a bit fast!

170
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,500
Really!

171
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,900
Look out!

172
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,900
Like a glove!

173
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,600
You should get this baby detailed.

174
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,400
The Consul General's car!

175
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,400
Down!

176
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,000
That's it. Down.

177
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,300
Come on, man!

178
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,500
Mr. Ventura, so looking forward
to your arrival.

179
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,100
Funny, it didn't seem that painful
when you did it to the horse.

180
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,300
Sir...

181
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,700
...Mr. Ventura has an affinity for animals.

182
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,700
Shall we?

183
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,700
Shalln't we?

184
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,600
Tell me, Mr. Ventura...

185
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
...just how good are you?

186
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,700
You're a workaholic.

187
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
You recently returned from a trip to Gotan,
in Northern Africa...

188
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,000
...and you just took a nasty spill
because of some...

189
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
...shoddy masonry work.

190
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,900
Very impressive.

191
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,000
May I ask how?

192
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,500
Surely.

193
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,700
The abrasion on your hand is the type
sustained in a three-to-five foot fall.

194
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,200
The remnants of plaster on your shoe
pointed to a careless mason.

195
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,600
Your new watch, a quality forgery, was...

196
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,200
...most likely purchased through
the North African black market!

197
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,300
And my work habits?

198
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,300
A workaholic.

199
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,000
The urine stain on your pants...

200
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,400
...would signify that you're a single-shaker!

201
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,800
Far too busy for the follow-up jiggle.

202
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,300
Brilliant, Mr. Ventura!

203
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,300
Simply brilliant!

204
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Spank you!

205
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,200
Spank you, very much!

206
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,500
We've been coexisting quite nicely
with the native cultures...

207
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,800
...for the past 200 years.
They're almost like family at this point.

208
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,700
Are they?

209
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,800
It is imperative that we recover
the sacred animal.

210
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,500
If not, the peaceable Wachati
will be obliterated.

211
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,200
The Wachootoo are bloodthirsty.

212
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,300
They consider its disappearance
both an insult and a curse.

213
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,500
Do I have something in my teeth?

214
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,100
Cadby!

215
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
Lovely brunch, I must say.

216
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,400
Quinn!

217
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,200
I'd like you to meet Ace Ventura.

218
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,800
This is Burton Quinn. He owns
and operates Quinnland Safari Park.

219
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,700
Most call me Quinn.

220
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,600
Say hello, Tinky.

221
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,200
Pleasure, Tinky.

222
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Corvus corax. Common raven.
Smartest of all birds.

223
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,700
Rare in these parts.

224
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,900
Excuse me.

225
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,100
That's quite a wrap you're wearing.

226
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,600
Perhaps I could get you
some fluffy new slippers...

227
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,100
...made from the heads of innocent
and defenseless baby seals!

228
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,300
Who is this ghastly man?

229
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,900
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

230
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
You must be...

231
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,100
...the Monopoly Guy!

232
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Thanks for the free parking.

233
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,000
Another activist, Maguire.

234
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Activist, yes.

235
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
Activist, yes.

236
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,100
Mr. Ventura...

237
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,700
...there's nothing wrong
with enjoying the fruits of nature.

238
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,300
You should try it some time.

239
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,200
All righty, then.

240
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,900
You know something?

241
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,500
You're right.

242
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,800
"Do not pass go.
Do not collect two hundred dollars."

243
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,400
It's lovely, but I fancy myself an autumn.

244
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,200
If you've quite finished, Mr. Ventura...

245
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,400
...we might make for the projection room.

246
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,900
Kooky.

247
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,100
I'd like you to meet Hitu,
chief of tribal security in the province.

248
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,500
Please!

249
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,700
Don't...

250
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
...get up.

251
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
At this point, we don't have any leads...

252
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,100
...but we've had similar problems
in the past.

253
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Sorry.

254
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,200
This is Derrick McCane...

255
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,100
...spotted several times in the province
in the past year. He makes a living...

256
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,000
...from rare and endangered species.

257
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,300
These two are Australians.

258
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
The bald one is Mick Katie.

259
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,800
The other is said to have been raised
by aborigine--

260
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,400
Aborigines.

261
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,200
The natives call him--

262
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Call him Gahjii...

263
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,000
...the hunter.

264
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,700
Both are known poachers
and have been seen in the area!

265
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,500
This wedding's in four days.
I cannot have bloodshed here!

266
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,700
We're counting on you!

267
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,500
Hi-ho, Silver!

268
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,000
Away!

269
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,600
I've assigned Greenwall to assist you.

270
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,300
Before you go, Mr. Ventura...

271
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,900
...l'd like to show you something
you may enjoy.

272
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,800
As one animal lover to another.

273
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,700
Something wrong, Mr. Ventura?

274
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,800
Of course not.

275
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,800
It's a lovely room of death.

276
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,100
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

277
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,300
Down, Boba!

278
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,900
Mr. Ventura, how could you?

279
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,300
Now, Mr. Ventura, I think the village
is about a mile ahead.

280
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,800
Excellent.

281
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,200
Flat tire!

282
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,700
I think this joke has run its course,
don't you?

283
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,400
Certainly.

284
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,200
I prostrate myself before you
and beg forgiveness.

285
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,800
Don't get me wrong.
I do enjoy the occasional prank.

286
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,700
It's just that my heel is getting rather raw.

287
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,200
We love you, Dark Continent! Good night!

288
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
Listen!

289
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,700
The majestic song
of the male silverback gorilla.

290
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,900
We should move along. It's their mating
season and they can get rather hostile.

291
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,300
Excuse me, Mr. Ventura.

292
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,000
I have to rest.

293
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,900
Of course you do!

294
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,100
The Wachati believe they draw their power
from these caves.

295
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Now they live in fear
since their sacred bat has vanished.

296
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
Bat?

297
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
What...

298
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
...bat?

299
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,600
The one we're here to find, Mr. Ventura.

300
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,100
You didn't say anything about a bat.

301
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,300
What's the difference?

302
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,100
What's the difference?

303
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,800
Have you seen one? They're hideous.

304
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,700
Lifeless, beady eyes, clawed feet,
huge grotesque wings. Even fangs.

305
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,500
They give you rabies.

306
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,900
Yes, quite. I see your point.

307
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,100
But are you saying
that you won't take the case?

308
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,300
No.

309
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,100
As a being of light, I must show
compassion for all living things.

310
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,300
Good.

311
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,500
I'm not touching it, though!

312
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,400
No, spank you.

313
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,800
The Wachati are a peaceful people.

314
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,500
They find all forms of life sacred.

315
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,500
I like them already.

316
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,500
Bumbawae Atuna.

317
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,700
Nice to see you.

318
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,000
Bumblebee Tuna.

319
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,700
Bumblebee Tuna.

320
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,500
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

321
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,900
How are you?

322
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,000
All righty, then.

323
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,500
Excuse me.

324
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,500
Your balls are showing.

325
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,400
Bumblebee Tuna.

326
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,800
They have lived in the same state
for thousands of years.

327
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,600
They did not know about disease
until the white man came.

328
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,500
What's going on over here?

329
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,300
All young Wachati warriors
must face five days...

330
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,000
...of balance and concentration.

331
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,500
Should he lose his focus and fall...

332
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,900
...he must start over again.

333
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,800
Earthquake test!

334
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,100
He's good.

335
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,200
With my help, he could be the best.

336
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,800
We should see the chief, Mr. Ventura.

337
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,500
This way.

338
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,900
Neato!

339
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,200
The chief says he knew you would come.

340
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,300
"Chim-chiminy chim-chim-cheroo!"

341
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,700
The chief has not understood
the dialect you're using.

342
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,100
Say I'm happy to meet him.

343
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,100
And that his sacred...

344
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,600
...bat...

345
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,500
...is as good as found.

346
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,900
My goodness. The chief really seems
to like you.

347
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,400
That is a great sign of affection
in the Wachati tribe.

348
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,900
Really?

349
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
This is the chief's son, Ouda.

350
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,000
The missionaries came through
and taught him English.

351
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,600
I like you!

352
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,200
My....

353
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Aren't I the popular one?

354
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,900
Allow me to display my affection.

355
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,000
It is the mucus...

356
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,000
...that binds us.

357
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,100
The chief says that
the sacred hut is over there.

358
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,300
How'd they pass the guard?

359
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm afraid he was found shortly after...

360
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,900
...sleeping.

361
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,100
At ease, Soldier.

362
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
We all make mistakes.

363
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Quite an auspicious dwelling
for a filthy, flying weasel.

364
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,500
Please, Mr. Ventura!

365
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,600
That is sacred ground. I'm sorry,
but only the Wachati are allowed there.

366
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,600
Take it easy.

367
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,700
I'm the lougie guy, remember?

368
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,000
Yes, yes, Chief. Thank you.

369
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,000
Thank you.

370
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,300
The chief says that unless
the sacred bat is returned...

371
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,200
...before the marriage of the princess,
the Wachati tribe will meet their death.

372
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,000
What type of bat are we talking about?

373
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,700
The great white bat, of course.

374
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,000
Crepuscular Chiroptera?

375
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,200
But to the natives:

376
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,500
Shikaka.

377
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
Shikasha!

378
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,800
Shish kebab.

379
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,000
Shawshank Redemption.

380
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,500
Chicago!

381
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,600
You're out of there!

382
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,100
Go on. You're gone. Go on!

383
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,500
Were you going to eat these?

384
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,000
I've got to inspect that cage.

385
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,700
My, my, my.

386
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,500
This fruit paste is delicious!

387
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,500
The pottery is lovely!

388
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,900
It's made from guano.

389
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,500
Guano?

390
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,300
That sounds so familiar.

391
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,100
Bat droppings.

392
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,400
It's a chief resource of the Wachati.
They use it to make things.

393
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,500
Yummy!

394
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:56,000
Now this is really fascinating.
This is a great Wachati tradition.

395
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,700
The virgin's dance of seduction.

396
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,900
I am now a holy man.

397
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,800
I think of women only as mothers
of our children.

398
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,600
They are a sanctuary
for the reproductive organs.

399
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,100
A temple to house the miracle
of procreation.

400
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,700
Do you have $1?

401
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,700
Thank you so much!

402
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,100
I've not danced in years!

403
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,000
Hi.

404
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,000
Don't mind me.

405
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,800
Sleep.

406
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,000
Sleep!

407
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,900
Fe...Fi!

408
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Fo...fum!

409
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,900
I smell the fingerprints of scum!

410
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,500
Better dust the place.

411
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,900
Totally clean.

412
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,600
Not one damn clue.

413
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,200
Unless....

414
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Here she comes. Oh, boy.

415
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,700
Holy, holy, holy, holy.

416
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,600
Good thoughts in, bad thoughts out.

417
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,700
You have come to help us.

418
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,600
We are in...

419
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,900
...great appreciation.

420
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,400
You...

421
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
...speak English.

422
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,500
Yes!

423
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,200
The missionaries came with books.

424
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,000
You are very good with that!

425
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,200
It's incredibly accurate.

426
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,500
Care to try?

427
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,700
Not bad!

428
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,300
Try again. Relax your shoulders.

429
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,800
Breathe.

430
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,700
And release.

431
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,300
There you go!

432
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,100
You make me smile.

433
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,400
And yet...

434
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,300
...l am troubled.

435
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,200
You see...

436
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,400
...the man my father wants me to marry...

437
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,900
...l am worried I will not please him.

438
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,100
I've never known a man.

439
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,400
I'd love to help.

440
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,000
But you see...

441
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,800
...l have vowed to take a life of celibacy.

442
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,800
Well....

443
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,200
Perhaps this...

444
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,900
...will assist your decision.

445
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,700
Those are very nice.

446
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,300
But I am a child of light. A pure spirit.

447
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,600
I'm no longer encumbered
by sexual appetites.

448
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,100
Oh, mama, oh, mama...

449
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,000
...oh, mama, oh, mama....

450
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,000
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ventura....

451
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,900
That's okay.

452
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,200
I was just...

453
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,700
...practicing my mantra.

454
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,000
Didn't you want to visit the sacred caves?

455
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
I do!

456
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,600
Meet me outside in ten minutes.

457
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,100
If I don't finish my meditation...

458
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,900
...l tend to get a little cranky.

459
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

460
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,200
Everything here seems good!
Big load off my mind!

461
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,400
You can speculate all you want,
but unless you check it out yourself...

462
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,800
...you never know.

463
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,700
Let's go back.

464
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,700
Don't you think you should investigate?

465
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,500
There's no reason to go in there. Ever.

466
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,500
I sense it as a holy man.

467
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,900
-You said you wanted--
-It's dark!

468
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,700
I could fall into a precipice.

469
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,400
Take this.

470
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,100
Spank you, Helpy Helperton.

471
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,300
I am not afraid!

472
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,500
I am not afraid.

473
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,800
I really like it here.

474
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,400
My medallion!

475
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,900
I will fear no living creature...

476
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,100
...as long as I keep this near me.

477
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,500
Take that, you winged spawn of Satan!

478
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,500
That's okay.

479
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,500
All I really need is my torch.

480
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,100
Die, devil bird!

481
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,900
I'm okay.

482
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,100
They're in my hair!

483
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,100
They're in my hair!

484
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,100
God in heaven! Help me!

485
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,300
There is nothing in your hair.

486
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,200
Exactly.

487
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,300
I was merely running a drill.

488
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Just as I suspected.

489
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,200
Quinn.

490
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
What?

491
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,700
We met him at Cadby's soirée.

492
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,700
His bird is a raven, Tinky.
I found that inside the cave.

493
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,400
You don't understand.
Burton Quinn is a powerful man.

494
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,200
Worry not.

495
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,200
For l...

496
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,400
...am a master...

497
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,400
...of disguises.

498
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,000
Eat up, guys!

499
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,600
None of this animal goes to waste.

500
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,500
Mr. McCane.

501
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
How're you?

502
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,800
I'm doing well.

503
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,100
Don't mind me, Mr. Quinn.

504
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,600
I'm just a curious little rhino.

505
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,900
I appreciate your...

506
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,400
...agreeing to undertake this.

507
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,300
Meeting secretly with sinister types much?

508
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Ah, not too much. Ah, much too much.

509
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,200
Kind of hot in these rhinos.

510
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,000
Warm!

511
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,500
I had a dog and his name was...

512
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,400
...Bingo!

513
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,300
Time to get some oxygen.

514
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,800
Come on!

515
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,900
Mayday!

516
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,200
Must...

517
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,600
...have...

518
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,300
...air!

519
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,300
Come on!

520
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,900
Quiet, quiet, quiet. Look, look.

521
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,500
Oh, look!

522
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,700
The mother rhino is giving birth!

523
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,400
Oh, God.

524
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,800
Mommy!

525
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,800
Cool!

526
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,400
We have to get out of here!

527
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,200
Quick, get in the jeep.

528
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,000
Quick, girls, get in!

529
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Welcome to Quinnland.

530
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,800
And you, too, my friend.

531
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,100
I know, you'll be happy here.

532
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
How did you get out, fella?

533
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,100
You're a cute little devil.

534
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,900
What you got?

535
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,900
Where's the bat?

536
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,400
What's this about?

537
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,900
Who are you?

538
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,700
Where...

539
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,500
...is...

540
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,500
...the bat?

541
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,300
I know who you are.

542
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,900
I met you at Cadby's!

543
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,400
You're that...

544
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,900
...Ventura fella!

545
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,900
Last chance!

546
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,200
Where is that darn bat?

547
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,000
What're you going to do?

548
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,000
What're you going to do?

549
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,900
Whatever I have to get some answers.

550
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,500
Stop!

551
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,800
Stop it!

552
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,700
You'd like me to stop it.

553
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,500
Getting to you?

554
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,400
I won't tell you anything.

555
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,100
A tough guy, huh?

556
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,800
I know what to do with tough guys.

557
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,200
My brother used to do that!

558
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,100
You sadistic bastard!

559
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,600
Stop it!

560
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,300
All right! I'll talk!

561
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,300
Spill it!

562
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,800
I paid Derrick McCane to find the bat.

563
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,800
I thought it could be an attraction.

564
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,600
Business has been a bit off lately.

565
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,000
So...

566
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,600
...you don't know who...

567
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,500
...took the bat?

568
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,300
Neither does McCane.

569
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,300
I'm going to untie you now.

570
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,100
Before I do, I want you
to know that I'm really...

571
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,400
...truly...

572
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,500
...very...

573
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,600
...sorry!

574
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,300
Appreciate the lift!

575
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,400
We'll walk from here.

576
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:23,600
Quinn is out of the picture.
We have no more suspects or clues.

577
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,300
But I have instincts.

578
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,300
And my instincts tell me
we're getting closer.

579
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,000
I can feel it.

580
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,900
I can feel it like it's right...

581
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,900
...in my neck!

582
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,500
Run!

583
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,100
Starting to get numb!

584
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,500
Three darts...

585
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,100
...is too much!

586
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,800
I think...

587
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,200
...l lost them!

588
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,900
Flowers...

589
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,800
...for me?

590
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,500
I do declare, Mr. Beauregard.

591
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,600
You are my hero.

592
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,800
Was l...

593
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,900
...talking in my sleep?

594
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,100
You've been suffering hysteria.
It's a natural reaction to the poison.

595
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,700
Water.

596
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,100
Guano bowls.

597
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,600
Collect the whole set.

598
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,200
Ace, did you see the shooter?

599
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,800
Only their feet.

600
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,800
Not enough for a positive ID.

601
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,300
It's the dart of a Wachootoo shaman.

602
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,600
The whaty whatan?

603
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:55,700
The Wachootoo shaman, or medicine man,
has protested the intertribal wedding.

604
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,300
Has he?

605
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,400
You do not speak Wachootoo.

606
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,500
I go with you.

607
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,400
Ouda will be my interpreter.

608
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,200
Please, take care.

609
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,400
The Wachootoo are savages.
If they catch you, they'll be merciless.

610
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,900
Worry not.

611
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,900
I will be as a fly on the wall,
a grain of salt in the ocean.

612
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,800
I will slip amongst them
like a transparent...

613
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,400
...thing.

614
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,500
The sacred bat must be in a hut.

615
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,500
We'll never know until
I can walk freely among them.

616
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,300
Wunderbar!

617
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,800
He exclaimed with great relish.

618
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,000
Come on, girls, show them what you got.

619
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,400
I'm sure it's fine.

620
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,000
Ouda is probably going for help right now.

621
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,900
Hello, Ace!

622
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,600
They found me!

623
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,200
No sweat!

624
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,800
Don't beat yourself up.

625
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,700
You know...

626
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,900
...gingivitis is the No.1 cause
of all tooth decay.

627
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,500
What does equinsu ocha mean?

628
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,100
White devil.

629
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,700
Tell him I'm not.

630
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,600
I only met you. How do I know?

631
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,000
-He said--
-Let me guess. "White devil"?

632
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,800
You speak Wachootoo?

633
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,000
Tell them what I'm saying:

634
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,800
I come in peace!

635
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,900
I couldn't help but notice
the equinsu ocha part.

636
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,900
Did you refer to me as "White Devil"?

637
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,500
That's how they know you.

638
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,900
Leave that part out from now on.

639
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,000
I represent the princess!

640
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,200
"War...

641
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,000
"...is hell."

642
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,700
The last thing we want...

643
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,700
...is a fight.

644
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,800
The chief said...

645
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,100
...if you pass all Wachootoo tests...

646
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,100
...you do not die.

647
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,100
Kooky.

648
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,100
My entrance to the winner's circle!

649
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,400
Your admiration is well-founded,
but I'm merely a servant.

650
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,900
Do not worship me!

651
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,000
Chief says you have passed all tests
but one.

652
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,600
Only left is Wachootoo Circle of Death.

653
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,400
Funny...

654
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,800
...that's my specialty.

655
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,300
This is it?

656
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,600
I have to beat him?

657
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,400
All righty, then!

658
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,600
I must tell you...

659
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,600
...l don't wish to fight.

660
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,500
Violence is no longer in my nature...

661
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,800
...but if you want it, you got it, sister.

662
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,400
Biting, I see.

663
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,200
I was unaware that the Wachootoo...

664
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,300
...were biters!

665
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,300
Why don't you try this on
and see how it fits?

666
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,100
He much better fighter than you.

667
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,900
Doi!

668
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,200
All right!

669
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,100
This White Devil thing
has gone far enough.

670
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,800
Nobody...

671
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,500
...messes...

672
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,800
...with the "do"!

673
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,900
He said, sorry, White Devil...

674
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,900
...but he must kill you.

675
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,000
I'll have you know
I have the reflexes of a cat.

676
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,600
And the speed of a mongoose.

677
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,300
Throw it!

678
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,100
I dare you!

679
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,300
Ouda, don't just stand there.
Throw me a spear!

680
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,100
It's in the bone! It's in the bone!

681
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,800
It's in the bone!

682
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,400
He says you make him laugh.

683
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,100
You are like sissy girl!

684
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,700
Wachootoo Chief say,
"You friend to Wachootoo."

685
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:21,200
But if the curse of Shikaka not lifted
by tomorrow's sun at top of sky...

686
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,700
...Wachootoo kill all Wachati
and smash your head on a rock.

687
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,700
Super.

688
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,800
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

689
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,500
Take care, now. Super. Bye-bye, then.

690
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,700
Are your legs sore?

691
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,600
Want me to carry you?

692
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,700
That won't be necessary.

693
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,500
I have a high pain threshold.

694
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,400
Holy monkey!

695
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,500
Ace, why you stopped?

696
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,000
The Wachootoo didn't take Shikaka.

697
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,800
Hi, welcome back.

698
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,100
What would you say this is?

699
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,900
Dart of Wachootoo shaman.

700
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,600
Precisely.

701
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,600
And when compared to one of the darts
that hit me before?

702
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,600
Same.

703
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,500
Only to the untrained eye.

704
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,400
The Wachootoo dart is made of wood
from a mimosa tree...

705
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:43,000
...while the other is carved
from a red fungus-bearing acalla.

706
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,100
And there's only one area
of the jungle with red...

707
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,100
...fungus-bearing acallas.

708
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,700
Go back to the village.

709
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,800
Tell them the Wachootoos attack
tomorrow at noon.

710
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,600
This little hound dog
just picked up a scent.

711
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,800
Won't be long now, Katie.

712
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,600
Big night tonight.

713
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,900
You're going to meet your new owner.

714
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,600
G'day.

715
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,500
Disgusting rat!

716
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,600
Gravy!

717
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,700
Did you hear that?

718
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,800
What is it?

719
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,400
Silverback.

720
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,200
Female.

721
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,300
Big.

722
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,400
About 200 meters...

723
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,200
...south.

724
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,400
We'd get $5,000 for one of those.

725
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,100
-What about the rat?
-Don't worry about it.

726
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,200
We'll be back in no time.

727
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,200
Stay downwind of it.

728
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,000
You're even uglier than I thought.

729
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,000
She's a big one, isn't she?

730
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,600
Oh, boy.

731
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,700
Deciduous trees on the bank.

732
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,500
Suman shrubs with extreme protococcus.

733
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,700
Steadily increasing water current.

734
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,000
Spike...

735
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:23,100
...l think we could assume
the stream gets pretty rough up ahead.

736
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,200
As soon as I get you loose,
you can chew through my ropes.

737
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,900
That's it!

738
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,200
That's it!

739
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,200
Yes. Your turn.

740
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,600
All right!

741
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,900
I'm alive!

742
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,900
I'm alive!

743
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,500
Say "uncle"! Say "uncle"!

744
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,000
Don't start what you can't finish!

745
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,900
Quit hitting yourself!

746
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,800
Quit hitting yourself!

747
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,400
Oh, water tastes good, yes!

748
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,700
This isn't over yet.

749
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:31,700
There's something I missed.
Some clue or motive I've overlooked.

750
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,600
And that motive is...

751
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,000
...plah!

752
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,600
Think!

753
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,800
Someone wants the tribes
to destroy each other.

754
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,700
There must be something valuable
in this equation.

755
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,300
Perhaps we should meditate, Spike.

756
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,600
For it is said that when seeking answers,
one must...

757
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,400
...quiet the soul in order to hear them.

758
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,700
What is it the Wachati possess...

759
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,300
...that is of great value to other men...

760
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,400
...besides the princess
with the amazing rack?

761
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,600
All righty, then.

762
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,000
You're back?

763
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,200
You can dispense with the smallpox,
all-knowing one.

764
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,500
I'm here on business,
and time is of the essence.

765
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,400
Very well.

766
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,300
What answer do you seek?

767
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,900
What do the Wachati possess...

768
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,600
...that is of great value to civilized man?

769
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,600
The medallion will lead you to the answer.

770
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,300
You do still have the medallion, don't you?

771
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,700
Medallion?

772
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,700
Why, surely.

773
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,700
I left it back...

774
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,900
...with my body.

775
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,700
Your aura...

776
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,200
...is weakening.

777
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,900
Okay! I threw it in a cave!

778
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,500
What do you want from me?
What are you? Mr. Perfect?

779
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,200
Where is it?

780
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,300
It's probably lying...

781
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,000
...in a big pile of....

782
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,100
Guano!

783
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,100
They have guano!

784
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,800
Like...

785
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,900
...a glove.

786
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,000
Hi, Chief!

787
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,700
Appreciate your meeting me here.

788
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,100
Let's go kick some...

789
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,400
...consulate butt.

790
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,900
Hello, Ace.

791
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,800
You want your money?

792
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,600
Wrong again, Sweeney Toad.

793
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,500
I've come for the sacred bat. Where is it?

794
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,800
Why...

795
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,900
...whatever can you mean?

796
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:14,400
Guano!

797
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,800
Hello!

798
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,800
Does "poop" ring a bell?

799
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,700
"Guano mines as a source of nitrate...

800
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,400
"...producing 84 percent
of the world's fertilizer...

801
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,100
"...a $1.4 billion industry."

802
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,300
That's what this war is about.

803
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:34,400
You can't take possession of the caves
while the Wachati inhabit the area.

804
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,000
And you want that dookie so bad...

805
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,700
...you can taste it.

806
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,000
I thought that--

807
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,300
Yes, thank you, Fulton.

808
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,500
That's a fine theory, Mr. Ventura.

809
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,100
What's it got to do with me?

810
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,900
I thought you'd...

811
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,700
...never ask.

812
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,000
When I met you, there was
a white substance on your shoe.

813
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,100
Yesterday, I saw the same substance
outside the hut...

814
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,300
...and it hit me that
the Great White Bat has white guano.

815
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,600
That's what you slipped in!
It was on your shoe!

816
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,500
And that explains the abrasion
on your palm!

817
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,800
Let me run that back for you.

818
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,800
That's what you slipped in!
It was on your shoe!

819
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,400
And that explains the abrasion
on your palm!

820
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,500
Damn, I'm good!

821
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,200
Can you feel that?

822
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:32,700
Can you feel it...

823
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,400
...Captain Compost?

824
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:39,000
The day of redemption is at hand!

825
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:42,000
Repent!

826
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,800
And thou shall be saved.

827
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,100
Very good.

828
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,000
Very good.

829
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,600
I believe you've solved the case.

830
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:59,700
One thing I still don't understand,
Mr. Belvedere.

831
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,500
If you are the slime behind
this little flim-flam...

832
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,400
...why, oh, why...

833
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,400
...did you hire me?

834
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,700
I'm afraid there'll be an investigation
after the war.

835
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,300
You were my alibi...

836
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,300
...to prove I'd done everything I could
to stop it.

837
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,800
Arrest him.

838
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,800
Arrest him!

839
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,800
Please arrest him.

840
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,500
Simon says, "Arrest him."

841
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:40,000
I thought you loved all animals,
Mr. Ventura.

842
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,500
I thought you loved all animals,
Mr. Ventura.

843
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,500
Shall I stick him on the wall?

844
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,200
No, I don't think it'll be necessary, Gahjii.

845
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,700
Mr. Ventura has very cleverly stolen
the sacred bat of the Wachati.

846
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,200
Unfortunately, we were unable
to recover it in time to stop the war.

847
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,200
Hit the lights!

848
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,900
The switch is on the wall beside you!
Go for it!

849
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,100
Flick it!

850
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,500
All righty, then.

851
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,600
Shall we go to jail?

852
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,200
What are you? H.R. Shove-n-Stuff?

853
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,200
Get in!

854
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,500
Just one more thing.

855
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,700
What are you doing?

856
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:02,700
Stop it!

857
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,500
I said, stop it!

858
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,300
To the jungle, Boba!

859
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,200
Friends...

860
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,700
...rodents...

861
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,300
...quadrupeds!

862
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,800
Lend me your ears!

863
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,500
Imbecile! You let him get away!

864
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,600
You don't seem to understand.
The tribe will be killed.

865
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,900
Remind me to send a sympathy card.

866
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,600
We're going to get the bastard.

867
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,800
There's nothing he can do now.

868
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,700
We've got the bat, and it's nearly noon.

869
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,000
What the hell's going on?

870
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,100
You see...

871
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,200
...humans and animals can live in harmony!

872
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,200
Sorry for the delay, Ace.

873
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,100
Hey, Poachers!

874
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:30,700
Say hello...

875
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,800
...to my stinky little friend!

876
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,700
Get out! Get out!

877
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Not so fast, Sally!

878
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,200
Get it away!

879
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,500
He wants to go off-road.

880
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,600
Nobody wants to play with me.

881
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,900
Loser!

882
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,100
From the consulate, right?

883
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,500
This is weird.

884
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,100
Noon.

885
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,200
The Wachati.

886
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,500
The spirit will overcome.

887
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,500
The spirit will overcome.

888
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,300
Headhunters!

889
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,700
Shikaka!

890
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,600
Coming through. Clear a path, people!

891
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,700
They will now consummate the marriage
as the tribe watches.

892
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,000
Well done, Ace.

893
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,700
You must be extremely proud.

894
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,900
Pride is an abomination.

895
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,800
One must forego the self...

896
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:05,400
...to attain spiritual creaminess...

897
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:08,500
...and avoid the chewy chunks...

898
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:10,700
...of degradation.

899
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,100
What'd he say?

900
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:23,400
I think he's saying, "She's not a virgin."

901
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,600
They can tell that?

902
