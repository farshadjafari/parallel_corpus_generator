1
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,190
China in the mid-19th century --

2
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,440
the suffering of its people
under the corrupt rule of the Qing dynasty

3
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,520
set the stage for the Taiping Rebellion.

4
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,350
During the chaos
of the 14 years long civil war,

5
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,100
70 million people died in battle
or from starvation...

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,060
The casualties equaled
the recorded death toll from WWII.

7
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,230
He said...

8
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,400
the day he crawled out from
the pile of corpses...

9
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,600
he was a dead man.

10
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,940
He also said...

11
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,400
it was an age when death came easy...

12
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,940
but living was hard.

13
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,650
All my men died.

14
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,650
I alone survived.

15
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,560
You were lucky.

16
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,940
I played dead.

17
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,850
My brothers... more than 1600 men...

18
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,230
fought for three days and nights...

19
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,850
They all died...

20
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,940
The Kui army were inhuman.

21
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,560
They only stood behind us and watched.

22
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,480
My brothers were slaughtered
one after another.

23
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,060
No one survived.

24
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,100
He met a woman that day.

25
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,350
They spent the night in a deserted house.

26
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,850
He didn't know if it was the woman
or the soup...

27
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,190
that brought him back to life.

28
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,900
Where can l find food?

29
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,900
Try the main street.

30
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,850
He said...

31
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,150
the first time he met me...

32
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,270
the sky was overcast, like his mood.

33
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,650
But I remember clearly...

34
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,480
that it was a glaringly sunny day.

35
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,150
Eat your food and let's get going!

36
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,690
Eat and get to work!

37
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,560
Dig in!

38
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,310
You sure know how to fight.

39
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,980
I should introduce you to my big brother!

40
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,150
Where are we going?

41
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,440
To rob!

42
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,940
From the rebel army!

43
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,270
He later told me he was outraged...

44
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,150
that bandits like us dared steal from troops.

45
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,310
What did we care? Famine is everywhere.

46
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,980
We either robbed or died.

47
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,690
Ride out!

48
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,730
Kill them!

49
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,560
Seize their leader, hurry!

50
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,850
He saved my life that day...

51
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,400
and taught me a lesson.

52
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,310
Strike the head... and the body will fall.

53
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,520
Brother Jiang...

54
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,730
Look!

55
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,850
That man gave them to you.

56
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,600
They're for generals.

57
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,060
Brother Jiang has become a general!

58
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,560
Brother Jiang has become a general!

59
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,560
What are you thinking about?

60
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,400
My home.

61
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,690
They've returned!

62
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,850
Come with me! We've got food!

63
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,230
I have good news, tonight we feast!

64
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,480
Why are you alone?

65
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,270
l ran away from home.

66
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,400
Is that a Yangzhou accent?

67
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,060
You noticed?

68
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,150
How could you tell?

69
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,230
Have you ever heard of Yangzhou Ponies?

70
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,270
You mean pretty young girls
who are trained as courtesans...

71
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,350
and sold to rich men?

72
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,850
Yes.

73
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,850
But when l turned 15...

74
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,730
and was about to be sold...

75
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,440
a man came and stole me away.

76
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,270
He was my childhood playmate.

77
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,690
He killed a few people.

78
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,480
We went into hiding and he became a bandit.

79
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,190
He thought he saved you,

80
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,400
but you were no longer the same peasant girl.

81
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,690
He's a good man.

82
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,310
Go in peace!

83
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,980
Go in peace!

84
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,310
Big brother laid down the rule...

85
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,560
to save seats and wine...

86
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,400
for the brothers who died.

87
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,480
Were you a general in the army?

88
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,230
Not anymore.

89
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,850
Why did you desert?

90
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,060
Drink up!

91
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,060
My troops and the Kui troops.

92
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,980
planned to join forces against the enemy.

93
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,230
But they betrayed us.

94
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,190
We were outnumbered...

95
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,060
and all my brothers were killed!

96
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,850
There's nothing more important
than the love between brothers.

97
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,020
That l agree.

98
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,060
These days, without brothers...

99
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,980
you can't survive.

100
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,730
Wu-Yang, dinner's here.

101
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,850
Are the new recruits staying?

102
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,900
No one wants to leave when there's food.

103
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,480
Except for Pang, he's not our kind.

104
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,480
I don't know if he's staying or not.

105
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,100
Pretty, isn't it?

106
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,150
l snatched it from a dead man.

107
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,310
Do you know what this is?

108
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,560
No.

109
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,980
lt protects you.

110
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,600
Did that night really happen?

111
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,350
I waited there for you...

112
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,520
wondering if it was all a dream.

113
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,850
lf you ran away, why did you come back?

114
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,400
I ran away many times,

115
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,980
had it all thought out.

116
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,730
But l always ended up back here.

117
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,600
Why did you come back?

118
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,060
You should decide for your own life.

119
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,520
Stay here!

120
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,520
"Kui".

121
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,900
Why are you robbing our food?

122
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,020
I dare you to hit me?

123
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,850
Go ahead!

124
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,350
Stop fighting!

125
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,190
l'm old enough to be your grandmother!

126
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,940
Stand back or l'll shoot!

127
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,940
I dare you!

128
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,940
I swear l'll shoot...

129
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,980
Go ahead! Kill me too!

130
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,440
You!

131
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,900
Nobody moves!

132
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,060
Look at me when l speak.

133
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,190
You think you can keep the food you robbed?

134
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,480
Consider this as a pay back to your country.

135
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,350
Let's go!

136
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,560
If only we had guns... we could fight them!

137
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,020
That's suicide!

138
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,060
I'd rather die than live like this!

139
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,900
Thieves are always on the run.

140
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,150
Why not join the army?

141
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,690
Once you're in the army...

142
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,940
you'll receive wages to feed your families.

143
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,310
You'll get guns so...

144
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,190
that no one will bully you.

145
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,900
This village will finally have peace.

146
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,150
We're bandits, will the army take us?

147
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,850
The Kui army is grandiose and powerful.

148
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,020
They couldn't care less about us.

149
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,980
But Lord Chen's army is desperate for men.

150
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,150
He wants to increase his power...

151
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,940
to rival the Kui army.

152
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,940
He should welcome us with open arms.

153
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,690
Er-Hu , use this opportunity

154
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,560
Then today's event... will never happen again.

155
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,100
Alright!

156
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,850
As bandits...

157
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,100
We have to be the biggest!

158
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,440
You deserted the Qing army,

159
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,850
now you want us to join them?
You're a two-faced man.

160
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,730
Why shall we trust you?

161
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,850
Take the blood oath!

162
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,480
To be blood brothers, we kill an outsider...

163
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,940
to show our loyalty to the brotherhood.

164
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,520
Only the lives of our brothers count.

165
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,100
The rest are expendable.

166
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,060
I asked him that day.

167
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,060
There's no turning back.

168
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,310
Are you certain?

169
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,690
He said nothing.

170
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,350
Let me...

171
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,560
Masters, what is it?!

172
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,060
What are you bastards doing?!

173
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,440
What did we do wrong?...

174
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,150
We were only passing through!

175
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:59,440
Have mercy on me... please...

176
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,980
Remember my face...

177
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,150
and take revenge in your next life!

178
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,900
We, Pang Qing-Yun,

179
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,850
Zhao Er-Hu,

180
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,020
and Jiang Wu-Yang...

181
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,520
join the brotherhood today.

182
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,980
We take the blood oath.

183
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,850
We pledge our lives.

184
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,730
Those who bring us harm...

185
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,020
must die.

186
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,020
A brother who harms another brother...

187
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,560
must die.

188
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,520
Heaven and earth bear witness...

189
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,230
and strike dead any man who breaks his oath.

190
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,560
We share one heart...

191
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,350
He told me later that...

192
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,940
he didn't believe in the pledge.

193
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,100
l asked him what he believed in.

194
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,350
He said Er-Hu...

195
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,020
and me.

196
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,400
Wait! Take these shoes with you.

197
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,150
Take care!

198
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,850
Mother may never see you again.

199
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,400
Good-bye, ma.

200
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,690
Er Hu!

201
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,310
Shi and his men are leaving!

202
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,730
He said that he'd rather die...

203
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,600
than serve the Qing army!

204
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,350
Your entire battalion perished...

205
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,020
in the battle against
the Taiping rebels in Hechuan...

206
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,270
and you disappeared for 2 months!

207
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,690
How dare you return now?

208
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,650
My Lord Chan.

209
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,100
Lord Jiang sent the Kui army...

210
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,150
to aid us in the battle at the Hechuan.

211
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,440
But they left us to fend for ourselves.

212
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,230
My men were slaughtered on the battlefield.

213
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,350
All your men died...

214
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,400
but you alone survived?

215
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,730
I stayed alive...

216
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,600
just to see you again...

217
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,060
Lord Jiang.

218
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,900
How many men do you have?

219
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,190
800.

220
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,690
Give me another 800...

221
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,310
and l will capture Shu City within 15 days.

222
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,520
Don't jest with me!

223
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,100
10!

224
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,400
I will capture Shu City in 10 days !

225
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,480
Well...

226
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,310
then...

227
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,900
I'll give you 1,500 fine soldiers...

228
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,850
but no wages.

229
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,850
We don't need wages;

230
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,560
we get half the spoils
once we capture Shu City.

231
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,100
Pang Qing-Yun.

232
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,690
Name your army "Shan".

233
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,440
Thank you, my lords.

234
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,480
You're gambling...

235
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,100
with 800 lives.

236
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,350
War is a gamble.

237
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,350
l won't gamble.

238
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,980
My 1500 men are the last of Lord Chen's army.

239
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,270
lf we lose them...

240
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,150
my lord will be powerless
at the imperial court.

241
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,900
Make me an offer!

242
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,560
My army...

243
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,600
will only give you a semblance of multitude.

244
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,600
This is your only chance for victory.

245
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:29,850
Otherwise...

246
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,480
you'll forever be at the mercy
of the Kui army!

247
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,480
Big brother!

248
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,020
They're all useless.

249
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,350
We'll be facing 200 rifles.

250
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,980
The odds are against us.

251
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,520
To win, we need to attack.

252
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,020
Break through their firing line...

253
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,850
Engage them in hand to hand combat.

254
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,730
Brothers!

255
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,400
Tell him who's the toughest?

256
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,020
We are!

257
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,850
The enemy will be 300 paces away.

258
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,350
Rifles have a range of 200 paces...

259
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,600
arrows have only 100.

260
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,150
We'll need a vanguard of 200 men...

261
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,850
to run straight at the firing range.

262
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,850
They must not dodge the bullets...

263
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,230
but must use their bodies as shields...

264
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,480
so that our archers...

265
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,600
who run behind them can get within range.

266
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,150
Many brothers will die in the process.

267
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,350
I'm in!

268
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,310
Who's with me?

269
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,400
Die and your family will receive
double your wages!

270
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,600
Live and you receive triple!

271
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,060
Don't you want to be rich?

272
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,350
Where are the real men?!

273
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,520
Come on!

274
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,480
Damn it, count me in!

275
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,690
Me too, l'm in...

276
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,270
Count me in...

277
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,940
me too...

278
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:29,730
l'm in...

279
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,560
Take Shu City!

280
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,560
Take their money, their food, their women!

281
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,480
Take Shu City!

282
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,850
Take their money, their food, their women!

283
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,060
Take their money, their food, their women!

284
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:48,350
Take their money, their food, their women!

285
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,150
You're vastly outnumbered...

286
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,850
victory is already ours.

287
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,230
Surrender and your life will be spared.

288
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:59,270
Kill them!!!

289
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,190
Fire!

290
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,350
Kill them!!!

291
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:57,980
Fire!

292
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,730
Fire!

293
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,690
Fire!

294
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,520
Kill them!!!

295
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,480
They're dying out there! Let's go!

296
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:27,850
Shut up and listen!

297
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,560
There's only one commander in a battle!

298
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,400
Kill them!!!

299
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,940
Shoot!

300
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,100
Shoot!

301
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,940
Brother!

302
00:36:55,850 --> 00:37:01,480
Brother!

303
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,230
Prepare!

304
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,100
Blinders on!

305
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,690
He's using himself to goad me into combat.

306
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,150
Go!

307
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,020
Big brother!

308
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,850
Brother...

309
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,350
No! Don't pull that out!

310
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,350
Hold steady!

311
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,850
We're really going to die this time.

312
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,900
We're blood brothers!

313
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,600
We die as one!

314
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:14,730
That's right!

315
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,060
We might as well take a few with us...

316
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,600
as we go down!

317
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,400
Let's go...

318
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,150
Kill them!

319
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,600
It's madness!

320
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,850
800 men manage to upset an army of 5000...

321
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,150
We can win!

322
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,150
We really need a victory badly!

323
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,560
Follow me!

324
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,020
Wu-Yang!

325
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,190
Wu-Yang!

326
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,850
Lord Di...

327
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,520
Pang Qing-Yun must be blessed.

328
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:01,730
Pang...

329
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,350
Fate has brought us together again.

330
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,150
How fortunate of you to capture Shu City...

331
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:09,190
you have made a name for yourself.

332
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,600
Pang...

333
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,440
how does 5 more battalions sound?

334
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,560
On top of that...

335
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,850
Lu Da-Shan... Sir

336
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,600
will be under your command.

337
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,020
Thank you, My Lord.

338
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,310
Pang Qing-Yun.

339
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,150
Your old friend from the Kui army
is waiting for you.

340
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:25,900
He Kui.

341
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:26,980
Sir.

342
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,850
Greetings, my lords.

343
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,850
It's been a long time, General Pang.

344
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:38,440
It'll be a reunion of old allies...

345
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,940
with you leading the attack...

346
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,020
and him bringing up the rear.

347
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,690
How do we divide the spoils?

348
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:44,730
Lord Di and...

349
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,190
Lord Chen...

350
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,230
no objections l trust?

351
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,480
I'm afraid he won't be able to keep up!

352
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,350
We'll take Suzhou, and then Nanking!

353
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,600
What are they laughing at?

354
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,230
Nanking is the enemy's capital.

355
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,350
To topple Nanking, we must first take Suzhou.

356
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:15,600
Since they have nothing to gain
when the war is over...

357
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,600
they won't let us take Suzhou.

358
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,850
If we attack, they can't stop us.

359
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,150
The Kui army was precisely sent...

360
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,190
to keep an eye on us.

361
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,350
They've returned!

362
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,980
Xiao-Wu

363
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:31,270
Xiao-Wu, Xiao-Wu...

364
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,730
Xiao-Wu's shoes...

365
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,650
Xiao-Wu...

366
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,020
Xiao-Qi?!

367
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:56,100
Xiao-Qi... my boys...

368
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,730
We were no longer bandits.

369
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:03,270
He said a bandit kills for his own interests.

370
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,440
But a hero sacrifices for others.

371
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,850
I wanted to be a hero.

372
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,520
You've lost weight.

373
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,150
Big brother says,
we'll only be away for 3 years.

374
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,310
I know you've never liked it here.

375
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,940
When the war is over...

376
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,350
l'll find us a better place to settle down.

377
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,650
Where's Brother Pang?

378
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,480
He's staying outside the village tonight.

379
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,560
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

380
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:12,310
Remember...

381
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:13,940
Winning is all that matters!

382
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:15,020
Begin!

383
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,850
Kill them!

384
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,100
We're here to take over.

385
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,690
Give the men 3 days leave to pillage!

386
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,440
Let them take money, food and women!

387
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,730
You can come out now, the war is over.

388
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:38,440
Come.

389
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,560
Come, don't be afraid.

390
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:41,980
Have you eaten?

391
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,850
Have you eaten?

392
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,690
You hungry?

393
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:49,850
Let go!

394
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,440
What are you doing?!

395
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:55,060
Don't just stay there! Give me a hand!

396
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,850
No!...

397
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,350
Don't touch me!...

398
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:06,980
Gouzi, l'm leaving!

399
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:10,980
Let me go...

400
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,480
Brother Pang.

401
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,230
Move! What is it?

402
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,690
Why am l being arrested?

403
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,940
Go! What is it?!

404
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,100
Gather the people for a public execution!

405
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,310
Brother Zhao!

406
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,520
Brother, what's this about?

407
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,100
They raped 2 women.

408
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,900
They were given three days of pillage,
this was bound to happen!

409
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,060
From this day on, I will not tolerate
such conduct under my command!

410
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,190
lt's what we've always done.

411
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:56,850
We're soldiers now, not bandits.

412
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,650
We must better ourselves or
we won't achieve anything!

413
00:52:58,900 --> 00:52:59,980
If we allow this to happen...

414
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:02,520
we're no better than those Kui bastards!

415
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:06,230
Today is the day we start
setting down some rules!

416
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,850
We've just killed their families!

417
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:10,400
Now you want to protect them?

418
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,310
By killing our own?

419
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:14,900
No one will risk their lives
fighting for you after this!

420
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,850
Brother...

421
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,650
Listen to me, look at them!

422
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,060
They've learned their lesson.

423
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,980
There's no need to kill them, right?

424
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,100
Don't just kneel there!

425
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,850
Say you're sorry!

426
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:31,560
Big brother, we were wrong, we're so sorry...

427
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,270
Gouzi! Say it again!

428
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,900
Gouzi, say you're sorry!
Say it!

429
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,400
Come on, Gouzi...

430
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,230
Big brother, we're sorry!

431
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:42,400
Big brother, they know they're wrong.

432
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,690
Have mercy.

433
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,190
When l was still a civil servant...

434
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,440
l saw a soldier...

435
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,690
beating a peasant on the street...

436
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:54,650
...until the man was covered
with his own blood.

437
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,730
There was no reason for it...

438
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,560
except that the man was poor.

439
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,310
But the poor man never retaliated.

440
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,850
He accepted it as part of his lot in life.

441
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:07,270
I promised myself that day...

442
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,520
l would never allow...

443
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,850
something like that to happen again!

444
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:13,980
You joined the army...

445
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,980
because you don't want to be bullied.

446
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,440
Let me tell you.

447
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:18,520
not only you but everyone...

448
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:21,690
men and women alike should be free
from oppression!

449
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,900
That's what we're fighting for!

450
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:30,850
That day...

451
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,480
he finally revealed his dream for the future.

452
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:34,650
He said...

453
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,690
he waited because he was afraid

454
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:39,310
we wouldn't understand.

455
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:40,150
But l did.

456
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,440
Stop!

457
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,100
Don't you touch my men!

458
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,190
Back off!

459
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,600
Brother...

460
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,190
Please...

461
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,650
Who do you owe your lives to?

462
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,190
Who?!

463
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,730
Big brother!

464
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,900
What will you tell my mother?

465
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,100
Closes your eyes.

466
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,230
l'll be quick.

467
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:26,100
Brother Jiang... What will you tell my mother?

468
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:35,310
Don't tell my mother!

469
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,560
How l wish I could sacrifice my life

470
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,020
for this future of his.

471
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,600
I used to think...

472
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,480
we only kill to survive.

473
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,480
Now I see that...

474
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,440
we must also kill in order to do good.

475
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:11,310
We must end this war in 3 months.

476
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:14,560
We must take Suzhou!

477
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,440
Look! The abandoned!

478
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,980
You're behaving like Pang,

479
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,900
too ambitious.

480
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:32,400
Thinks he can take Suzhou
with a few thousand men?

481
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,650
I'm worried for you, Lord Chen

482
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,270
With no supplies or reinforcements...

483
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:39,940
He's dead for sure!

484
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,060
There's a fine line between
winning and losing.

485
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:47,900
If l add the right piece... here.

486
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,190
Pang might just climb to the top...

487
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,230
with his next victory.

488
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,600
Do you think I'd let Pang return to the fold?

489
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,850
Leaving him stranded...

490
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,650
benefits everyone.

491
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:29,440
"Suzhou City, One Year Later"

492
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:42,400
What's keeping all of you?!

493
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:47,690
Come get me now or l'll break your legs!

494
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:13,310
Suzhou is at an impasse;

495
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,850
both sides will starve to death.

496
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,730
The Kui army are waiting
to swoop like vultures!

497
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:22,060
How much longer can you afford to gamble?

498
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,350
Butcher...

499
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,560
...sing me a song.

500
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:37,270
I heard that...

501
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,730
there is a man named Jesus.

502
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,100
Each day at noon...

503
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:45,190
He gives the Taiping general
Huang in Suzhou...

504
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,060
5 loaves of bread and 2 fat pigs.

505
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:52,850
He would then divide the food casually...

506
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,690
and somehow he feeds all 5000 people...

507
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,560
Everyone is fed.

508
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:01,980
Their bread never runs out.

509
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:06,560
And new piglets are being born everyday.

510
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,150
Sit down!

511
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,850
Sit down!

512
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:47,980
I'll steal into the city and kill Huang.

513
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,850
Those who tried never came back.

514
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:51,730
I won't put more lives at risk.

515
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:54,850
l'll go ask Lord Di...

516
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,900
for food and weapons.

517
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:01,230
But we've defied their orders
by attacking Suzhou.

518
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,230
I'm still of some use to them.

519
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,440
Please leave now.

520
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:24,440
Give me provisions and I'll seize Suzhou!

521
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,520
My men may die in battles
but not from hunger!

522
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:37,400
Please, I beg you!

523
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:46,600
My lord says he didn't know Suzhou was at war.

524
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:56,850
To the Kui army!

525
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:59,600
We can't go begging to them!

526
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,230
Then l will go alone!

527
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,850
Let's go!

528
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,480
Quick!

529
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:17,690
Hurry...

530
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:20,560
Take my hand!

531
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:22,690
They tried to steal into the city;

532
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,480
they all said there was food inside.

533
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:36,650
l must go in for myself.

534
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:42,150
Give me provisions and weapons...

535
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,600
l'll make you a deal.

536
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:45,850
l don't need that -

537
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,850
Suzhou is already mine.

538
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,020
I'm talking about...

539
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:50,480
Nanking.

540
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,310
My men do the fighting and the dying!

541
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:59,150
All you have to do is stand behind us.

542
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,480
We divide Nanking between us;

543
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,100
we enter the city together...

544
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:04,730
unless you want to be under.

545
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:07,020
the power of those three old men forever.

546
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,060
We must capture Nanking...

547
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,520
before the Kui army arrives to take credit.

548
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:26,150
But we only have 10 days' supplies.

549
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,690
We act quickly

550
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,520
We capture Suzhou within 2 days!

551
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,650
The heavens are good to me...

552
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,520
sending you to me tonight.

553
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,350
lt can protect you.

554
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:36,980
If you don't see a red flare
by dawn from inside the city...

555
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:38,850
my men will take you to safety.

556
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:43,520
Tell big brother and Wu-Yang that...

557
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,940
Er-Hu wanted to be a hero.

558
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,400
General Pang is back!...

559
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:13,150
Sir, the provisions have arrived!

560
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,190
General Zhao has entered the city.

561
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,310
He said if we see a red flare by dawn...

562
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,150
it means he has succeeded.

563
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,850
My friend, did you bring the goods?

564
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:47,940
They say we have food in the city.

565
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,850
But we may start eating each other soon.

566
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,940
I promised they would be clothed and fed...

567
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,310
and could go home within 3 years.

568
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,690
It's been 5 years now...

569
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,060
We attack at dawn.

570
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:10,940
Lian.

571
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,980
I like to study different faces...

572
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,310
but l haven't seen a new face...

573
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,020
since Suzhou came under siege a year ago.

574
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:06,190
l hear the opium dealer is a new face

575
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:12,190
but l don't use opium anymore -

576
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:14,520
it only eases the pain.

577
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:23,190
My wife's grave is just outside the city
in the woods.

578
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:26,980
I long to see her...

579
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:29,940
but can't.

580
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,900
Do you know what it's like to be a prisoner?

581
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:43,980
Suzhou has become one big prison...

582
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:48,270
I can't get out...

583
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:52,100
you can't get in either...

584
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,690
unless...

585
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,440
I let you in.

586
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:59,520
Remember Shi?

587
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:02,020
You joined the Qing army, he followed me.

588
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,850
Hurry!

589
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,520
Sir... it's past dawn

590
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:42,900
Prepare the horses.

591
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,850
Escort Lady Zhao away.

592
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,230
Er-hu said that...

593
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,060
he wanted to be a hero.

594
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:14,020
If l survive, l will...

595
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:17,230
marry you.

596
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,190
4,000 soldiers are outside crazed
with starvation.

597
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,850
lf you kill me...

598
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:33,650
you will all die in a blood bath.

599
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,480
I too have 4,000 men.

600
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:40,850
They'll defend every inch of the city...

601
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,520
to their last drop of blood.

602
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,900
Stand down.

603
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:55,690
Lay down your arms.

604
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,400
Please surrender!

605
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,560
11 years ago...

606
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:21,020
l closed my business and sold everything...

607
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,940
to join the Taiping rebellion.

608
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,310
From that day on...

609
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,310
the word "surrender"...

610
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:32,520
no longer existed for me!

611
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,600
As long as l live...

612
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,980
the people of Suzhou City...

613
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:29,850
will never be free.

614
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:37,850
Spare my soldiers... let them go home.

615
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:44,850
Don't make the civilians suffer.

616
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:52,600
May you...

617
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,060
go in peace!

618
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:46,270
Get ready!

619
01:16:55,480 --> 01:17:14,690
Er-Hu... Er-Hu...!

620
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:03,440
Zhao Er-Hu!

621
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,900
I want to see Zhao Er-Hu!

622
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:08,310
We want bread! Bread!...

623
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,060
Are we going to conscript them?

624
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,480
They will never agree.

625
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:18,560
There are 4,000 captives.

626
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:21,230
How much of our food will you give them?

627
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,520
Brother...

628
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:23,940
They surrendered only because...

629
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:25,940
I promised to let them live.

630
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:28,940
The city's granaries are empty, and...

631
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:30,940
we have only a 10-day-supply of food.

632
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:34,150
We must save it for Nanking.

633
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:38,560
Nanking?

634
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:40,600
Are we attacking Nanking?

635
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:41,900
The Kui army decamped yesterday;

636
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:43,850
they will attack Nanking at any moment.

637
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:45,600
l can't read!

638
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:48,310
Just tell me where the supplies are from?

639
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:49,940
Where?!

640
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,150
The Kui army.

641
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:54,270
How could you make a deal with He Kui?!

642
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,060
These solders will never join our army.

643
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:57,690
If we attack Nanking...

644
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:59,350
Suzhou will be defenseless.

645
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,480
Can you leave the city in their hands?

646
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:03,850
- Listen to me! - No, you listen!

647
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,190
These soldiers are our enemies.

648
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:21,980
We want bread! Bread!...

649
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,310
Open the stores!

650
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,350
Give me what I need.

651
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:25,480
No!

652
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:26,940
Pang Qing-Yun!

653
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:28,480
I knew you were a liar!

654
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:37,060
This bread...

655
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:40,230
was meant for our brothers.

656
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,980
But you want to give half to the captives...

657
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,060
and then the other half to the civilians.

658
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,940
Our brothers have fought for 9 months...

659
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:53,150
and starved for 9 months!

660
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:56,850
You tell me...

661
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:59,350
Who should get this bread, them or us?

662
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:02,100
l don't care!

663
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,730
Give them food!

664
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,440
Now!!!

665
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:11,480
Let them eat.

666
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,560
It's their last meal

667
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:18,440
But I promised to spare their lives!

668
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,230
Winning is all that matters in war!

669
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,690
A man who breaks his word is a beast!

670
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:25,480
Brother...

671
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:26,850
He's right.

672
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:32,190
Move!

673
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,350
He's right

674
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:40,060
Get out of the way!

675
01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:42,020
He's right.

676
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:53,230
Let me go!...

677
01:20:56,730 --> 01:21:00,600
Let me go! l promised to spare their lives!

678
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,480
Archers!

679
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:28,480
Quiet!

680
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:09,190
Don't kill them!

681
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:14,900
Again!

682
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,520
Again!

683
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:35,940
Again!

684
01:22:38,850 --> 01:22:40,150
Again!

685
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:45,270
Don't kill them! Don't kill them!

686
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,730
Again!

687
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:51,980
Again!

688
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:56,730
Again!

689
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,600
From that day on...

690
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,270
Er-Hu never said another word to me.

691
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:11,190
It hurts, but...

692
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,900
big brother was right.

693
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,020
Let's go home!

694
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,270
Who's with me?

695
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,900
Er-Hu, you can't go.

696
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,230
We still have to take Nanking.

697
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:53,480
What for? To kill more defenseless people?

698
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:55,600
They were soldiers.

699
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:56,810
They surrendered!

700
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,100
They were still soldiers!

701
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:00,650
Do you remember what you said to us?

702
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,850
You said everyone deserves...

703
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:05,520
to be free even the poor!

704
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:07,850
What have you done now?

705
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,400
You have ordered right here...

706
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,810
the massacre of 4,000 poor people?!
You know that?!

707
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,020
Only the poor are willing to go to war!

708
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,850
Which one of us weren't poor!

709
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:21,850
Those men were soldiers.

710
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:24,520
Soldiers are prepared to die.

711
01:27:26,650 --> 01:27:30,940
But the millions in Nanking are just civilians.

712
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:34,020
lf He Kui reaches them first, they're dead!

713
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:40,060
I need your help to take Nanking.

714
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:43,520
Please don't go.

715
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,480
If you go, it will be mutiny.

716
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:49,520
The Shan brothers will turn on each other!

717
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:52,100
Think about the consequences!

718
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:54,190
Don't force my hand!

719
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:58,850
I'll kill anyone who touches Er-Hu!

720
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:04,520
Brother, you must not leave.

721
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:10,730
If you leave now... ours pledge will be broken

722
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:12,850
Er-Hu!

723
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,440
The Kui army has already left.

724
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:22,980
We must leave now or we'll be too late!

725
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,600
I promise you...

726
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,100
after Nanking...

727
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,020
there'll be peace.

728
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,060
One day you'll see that...

729
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:36,480
my decisions today were right.

730
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:45,940
Fine.

731
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:50,020
l'll be watching you in Nanking.

732
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:53,270
lf you're right, I'll kneel before you.

733
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:57,730
But if you're wrong, l'll kill you.

734
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:00,850
Let's go!

735
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,480
We...

736
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:11,270
Zhao Er-Hu... Pang Qing-Yun...

737
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:14,730
Jiang Wu-Yang... three brothers as one...

738
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,020
Attack!

739
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:44,980
Victory is ours, Nanking is ours!

740
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:49,270
Long live the Empress Dowager!

741
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:54,520
One month after the capture of Nanking.

742
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:31,270
Go in peace.

743
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:36,150
We swore an oath...

744
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:39,400
to remain loyal to the Shan regiment.

745
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,730
As long as there is hunger, oppression...

746
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:47,480
and injustice...

747
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,600
the Shan regiment will fight!

748
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:56,230
Dole out the wages!

749
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:59,900
Zhang Wen-Fang, 5 taels.

750
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,850
Wang Xiao-San...

751
01:31:04,190 --> 01:31:06,350
Er-Hu, what are you doing?!

752
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,730
The money belongs to the imperial coffers!

753
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:13,730
We agreed to take Nanking
and give half of the spoils to our men.

754
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:18,520
If you won't do it! l will!

755
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:23,310
Remember!

756
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,850
The Shan regiment has only one leader!

757
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:30,520
And that's General Pang!

758
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,600
Show him your gratitude!

759
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:36,850
Thank you General!

760
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:38,020
Again!

761
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:43,060
Thank you General!!!

762
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:45,650
Back to the wages...

763
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,100
Wang Xiao-San, 3 taels 4 mace.

764
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,190
Wang Long, 4 taels

765
01:31:57,850 --> 01:31:58,900
My lord.

766
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:03,350
He needed your help to take Nanking.

767
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,100
Now you're at his mercy.

768
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:07,900
l will kill him eventually!

769
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,940
You're always a step behind

770
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:12,060
The Empress is making him
Governor of Jiangsu.

771
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:13,350
So what?

772
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:17,400
He Kiu, even I can't help you this time.

773
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,100
We just need to get Zhao Er-Hu on our side...

774
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:22,350
and Pang's downfall is ensured!

775
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:26,350
Zhao Er-Hu... Pang Qing-Yun...
Jiang Wu-Yang...

776
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:29,400
three brothers as one...

777
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,230
Drink up!

778
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:45,400
Heaven and earth be our witnesses.

779
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:52,310
We take a blood oath, pledge our lives.

780
01:32:53,650 --> 01:33:00,850
We were born apart but die as one.

781
01:33:08,650 --> 01:33:12,020
Loyalty through good times...

782
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:29,600
and bad.

783
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:14,520
General Zhao, you did the fighting.

784
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:16,520
but he took the credit.

785
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:19,310
How can you live with that?

786
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,150
So what?

787
01:34:22,730 --> 01:34:25,270
This opera is about brotherhood.

788
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:29,900
He's your brother, yet he had you in chains?

789
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:33,900
He forced you to break your word
and made a fool out of you.

790
01:34:36,690 --> 01:34:38,060
Make him pay.

791
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,400
lf we join forces and Nanking can be ours.

792
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:45,020
Give it some thought.

793
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:50,190
General He is only thinking of your future.

794
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:53,190
Come over here!

795
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,690
Revenge is sweet!

796
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:19,520
Shallow wounds heal...

797
01:35:19,690 --> 01:35:21,900
but deep wounds fester.

798
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:26,190
General Zhao, take your time to think it over.

799
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,060
General He.

800
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:52,690
You must be wondering...

801
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:56,480
how long it takes to get
from the gates to here?

802
01:36:56,850 --> 01:37:00,190
I had the same thought the first time...

803
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:02,310
l stood outside the palace gates.

804
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:05,350
By the time I reached this far...

805
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,730
my hair had already turned gray

806
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:13,060
it took me 30 years.

807
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:16,900
Now I'm too old to walk.

808
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,400
Li Lianying.

809
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:35,020
The Empress said your youth is an asset;

810
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:38,650
you will serve us for a long time.

811
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:41,190
The Empress also said.

812
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:44,310
Pang should be commended for
the capture of Nanking.

813
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:47,730
He will receive the Golden Robes.

814
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:53,270
and appointed Governor of Jiangsu!

815
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:56,730
Show your gratitude!

816
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,560
Your servant Pang requests that...

817
01:38:00,850 --> 01:38:04,520
the people of Jiangsu be exempt
from 3 years of taxes

818
01:38:04,730 --> 01:38:06,520
to recover from the war.

819
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:15,350
Request granted!

820
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,190
Thank you your Highness.

821
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:23,900
You're responsible for the Suzhou massacre...

822
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:27,310
yet you saved the people of Nanking.

823
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:30,310
Lord Pang, you're surely adaptable.

824
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:36,100
The Empress favors Lord Pang because

825
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:38,730
he does not belong to any fractions.

826
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:40,600
Nanking may be yours,

827
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:43,980
But you've offended Lord Jiang
and He Kui along the way.

828
01:38:44,150 --> 01:38:46,350
Now, without allies...

829
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:49,230
how long do you think you'll last?

830
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,190
Lord Pang, l checked the lunar calendar.

831
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,940
The 8th day of the 4th month...

832
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,520
will be the most auspicious time
for your inauguration

833
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:00,730
...and for all.

834
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:02,690
Before you can do good...

835
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:05,560
Lord Pang, you must look after yourself!

836
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:07,900
You must look after yourself.

837
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:14,350
l must leave now, My lords.

838
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:16,900
The unrest has subsided,

839
01:39:17,730 --> 01:39:21,400
but the local militias wield too much power.

840
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:27,690
Lord Pang, the Empress is concerned.

841
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:32,020
The Shan regiment will be the first to disband.

842
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:33,190
Good!

843
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:36,060
Once you sever your old ties...

844
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:41,020
you can devote yourself
to your duties as governor.

845
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:45,730
Your brother Zhao Er-Hu
threatened to desert the army in Suzhou.

846
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:47,020
He almost created...

847
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:49,560
a mutiny there.

848
01:39:49,730 --> 01:39:54,350
In Nanking, he doled out funds meant
for the royal coffers.

849
01:39:54,730 --> 01:39:57,270
Does he own your regiment?!

850
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:14,690
Be careful, my lord!

851
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:19,440
l've walked on thin ice my whole life.

852
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:22,100
Do you think I can safely cross over?

853
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:06,600
You're awake.

854
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:09,440
Yes, I am.

855
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:14,230
Perhaps they're right.

856
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:18,310
Nanking...

857
01:41:19,850 --> 01:41:21,560
doesn't need someone like me.

858
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:32,270
I want to go home.

859
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:35,980
Will you come with me?

860
01:41:44,690 --> 01:41:46,060
I don't need this anymore.

861
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:55,150
What is it?

862
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:56,730
Bad news, my lord!

863
01:41:56,850 --> 01:41:59,270
He Kui plans to assassinate Lord Pang!

864
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:03,270
It's nothing.

865
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:05,850
General Zhao.

866
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:07,560
Big brother!

867
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:08,190
General Zhao.

868
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:09,270
Big brother!

869
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:12,440
General Zhao.

870
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:13,600
Where's he?

871
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:16,020
Lord Pang has not returned
from the imperial court.

872
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:28,150
Decided?

873
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:31,150
Then I'm off.

874
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:43,850
General Jiang.

875
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:45,060
General Jiang.

876
01:42:45,650 --> 01:42:46,730
Who are they?

877
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:48,850
Guards sent by the imperial court.

878
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:51,850
Cover that table with the red cloth.

879
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:54,310
Move these vases as well.

880
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:55,730
Hurry!

881
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:57,940
Brother Wu Yang You have guests coming?

882
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:00,600
General Pang has invited General Zhao to dine.

883
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:01,940
They've reconciled!

884
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:03,270
Is big brother home?

885
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,600
He should return by the afternoon...

886
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:09,020
why have they replaced all the guards?

887
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:15,690
General Zhao, wait!

888
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,480
Sir...

889
01:43:18,690 --> 01:43:21,350
We received news that...

890
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,690
He Kui plans to assassinate Lord Pang.

891
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:24,310
He must not return to the city now

892
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,850
he asked you to meet him at Jianpu.

893
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:31,150
Tell Wu-Yang to bring the others
and meet us there.

894
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:51,900
Wu-Yang.

895
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:53,230
Where's Er-Hu?

896
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:55,520
He...

897
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:57,270
went to see Brother Pang.

898
01:44:54,850 --> 01:44:56,270
You're up to something!

899
01:44:56,690 --> 01:44:58,650
What's with all those new guards?

900
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,150
You're going to kill Er-Hu...

901
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:08,520
all because of Lian?!

902
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:10,690
Have you forgotten our pledge?!

903
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,310
When will Er-Hu arrive?

904
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:17,310
Tell me when!

905
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:21,100
Nightfall...

906
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:23,850
He'll be here by nightfall.

907
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:25,400
Wait for me!

908
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:03,480
You scared me.

909
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:10,150
Lian, I'm here to say goodbye.

910
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:12,440
Are you leaving?

911
01:46:13,690 --> 01:46:15,020
No, you are.

912
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:18,400
But where to?

913
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:24,100
I'm waiting for Er-Hu...

914
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:26,520
l've just prepared dinner.

915
01:46:26,690 --> 01:46:29,690
Big brother is going to kill Er-Hu over you.

916
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:34,440
No, it can't be!

917
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:39,560
Come down here.

918
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:42,940
No.

919
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:46,560
I have to finish draping this frame.

920
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:50,690
Have you ever seen such beautiful fabric?

921
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:54,350
l haven't seen one in years.

922
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:58,100
l saw the red one in a shop yesterday...

923
01:46:58,690 --> 01:47:01,060
but l also wanted the green one.

924
01:47:01,270 --> 01:47:02,850
I asked Er-Hu what to do

925
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:04,100
He said...

926
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:07,900
green for this year and red for the next.

927
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:10,980
I'll be 29 next year.

928
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:12,690
l lived through 14 years of war...

929
01:47:12,850 --> 01:47:14,650
didn't starve to death or get killed.

930
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:16,100
I've been lucky!

931
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,980
I still have to hang the red curtain next year.

932
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:23,560
I still have to hang the red curtain next year.

933
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:24,850
Come down!

934
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:34,440
You wouldn't kill me... I won't let you!

935
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:35,980
lt wasn't easy for me to survive!

936
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:38,100
Why must you kill me?

937
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:42,560
lf I don't kill you... how will I save Er-Hu?

938
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:47,480
Can you really save him by killing me?

939
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:49,060
l don't know...

940
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:52,190
but it's all l can do.

941
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:54,850
I watched you grow up.

942
01:47:55,690 --> 01:47:59,100
You wouldn't do it... You won't!

943
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,060
I know you can't kill me...

944
01:48:02,230 --> 01:48:03,020
You wouldn't do it...

945
01:48:03,230 --> 01:48:04,730
Anyone who harms our brothers...

946
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:06,560
You can't kill me!

947
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:08,310
must be...

948
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:10,310
killed!

949
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:40,310
5 years ago...

950
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:45,400
108 men left their village to join the army...

951
01:48:45,850 --> 01:48:48,980
risking their lives for a little food.

952
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:53,850
They were the first to join the Shan army

953
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:58,100
The three of us were their leaders.

954
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:10,730
Today, l found a good place to free you

955
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:13,600
I told you...

956
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:19,850
there will come a day when you'll see that
I was right.

957
01:49:28,650 --> 01:49:32,650
Each year at this time, I'll drink with you.

958
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:36,100
l'll tell you what I've done in the past year.

959
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,350
l just returned from the palace.

960
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:57,230
The people of Jiangsu have been...

961
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:00,650
spared from taxes for 3 years.

962
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:05,100
Next year, l promise...

963
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:07,350
no one will go hungry.

964
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:11,480
You'll understand eventually

965
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:14,690
that Xiao-Qi and Gouzi...

966
01:50:15,850 --> 01:50:17,850
didn't die in vain...

967
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:20,980
and the massacre of the 4000 captives...

968
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:25,100
was necessary.

969
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:29,650
And you...

970
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:33,650
You...

971
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:40,600
You will not die in vain.

972
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:45,150
You defied my orders in Suzhou.

973
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,150
I could have killed you then,

974
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:51,100
but I couldn't do it.

975
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:53,850
But now it's the imperial court...

976
01:50:57,310 --> 01:50:58,940
that wants you dead.

977
01:50:59,270 --> 01:50:59,940
He Kui!

978
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:03,060
What choice do I have?

979
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,270
Come out here!

980
01:51:08,850 --> 01:51:14,190
My brother...

981
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:17,310
go in peace.

982
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,440
Brother...

983
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:28,310
Brother...

984
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:42,850
Big brother, you don't need to kill Er-Hu!

985
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:44,940
Brother!

986
01:51:48,850 --> 01:51:50,060
Brother!

987
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:56,690
you don't need to kill Er-Hu!

988
01:51:57,230 --> 01:51:59,350
Lian is dead!

989
01:52:00,850 --> 01:52:02,440
You don't have to kill Er-Hu!

990
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,270
Lian is already dead...

991
01:52:08,850 --> 01:52:10,940
no reason to kill Er-Hu now!

992
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:12,480
Brother!

993
01:52:13,730 --> 01:52:15,940
Lian is dead!

994
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:18,980
The gods bless this day.

995
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:21,230
Joining the ranks of those that went before...

996
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:23,020
a great servant to the empire.

997
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:25,480
To lead by example and serve his people.

998
01:53:25,690 --> 01:53:31,310
The inauguration of Pang Qing-Yun
as Governor of Jiangsu will take place...

999
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:35,730
at noon on this day, the 8th of the 4th month.

1000
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:28,560
A fence needs three pillars.

1001
01:54:29,230 --> 01:54:33,190
It's not the same without Lord Jiang here.

1002
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:57,690
A quarter to 12.

1003
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:23,150
Stand down!

1004
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:26,850
A brother who harms another brother...

1005
01:55:27,850 --> 01:55:29,440
must die!

1006
01:55:52,850 --> 01:55:57,020
A brother who harms another brother must die.

1007
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:22,520
It's time.

1008
01:56:24,650 --> 01:56:25,900
Don't push me!

1009
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:50,060
A brother who harms another brother...

1010
01:56:50,270 --> 01:56:51,850
must die!

1011
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:28,270
Wu-Yang!

1012
01:57:33,020 --> 01:57:36,270
l beg you stop!

1013
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:43,020
A brother who harms another brother must die.

1014
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:40,900
Pang Qing-Yun!

1015
01:58:57,020 --> 01:58:59,650
Pang has talent

1016
01:58:59,850 --> 01:59:02,100
but doesn't know how things work.

1017
01:59:03,270 --> 01:59:05,520
Nanking is of vital importance

1018
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:08,400
to the peace of the country.

1019
01:59:08,690 --> 01:59:11,980
The Empress would never entrust it
to an outsider.

1020
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:16,100
Pity... such is life.

1021
01:59:16,310 --> 01:59:20,310
Noon is here! Salute cannons, fire!

1022
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:05,900
Honor our pledge...

1023
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:08,650
now!

1024
02:01:28,690 --> 02:01:32,150
l, Jiang Wu-Yang, killed Pang Qing-Yun!

1025
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:43,310
At that moment...

1026
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:47,230
My mind went back to the day
we took the blood oath.

1027
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:51,850
We are born apart but we shall die as one.

1028
02:01:56,400 --> 02:02:00,440
Our origins are different...

1029
02:02:00,690 --> 02:02:05,100
but our hearts act as one.

1030
02:02:05,310 --> 02:02:09,850
In good times and bad...in life and in death.

1031
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:13,900
We honor our pledge.

1032
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:16,690
With Heaven and earth as our witness.

1033
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:20,400
We shall live and die as blood brothers...

1034
02:02:21,150 --> 02:02:24,520
Governor of Jiangsu, Pang Qing-Yun...

1035
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:27,900
was assassinated on the 26th of July, 1870.

1036
02:02:28,270 --> 02:02:32,400
His assassin Jiang Wu-Yang was executed
2 months later.
