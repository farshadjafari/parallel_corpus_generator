Are you Shuisheng?

19
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:58,860
Uncle Liu?

20
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,056
Gosh you've grown!

21
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:03,354
-How's your dad?
-Fine.

22
00:03:03,454 --> 00:03:04,653
-Your ma?
-Fine.

23
00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:07,850
I was afraid
I wouldn't find you.

24
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:10,746
Ma said I should wait...

25
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:13,842
by the boat.

26
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,539
In Shanghai
you have to watch out.

27
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,137
Get in the truck.

28
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,812
FIRST DAY

29
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:40,240
Shuisheng!

30
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,839
Stay in the truck!

31
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:56,851
Mr. Song.

32
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:56,081
Now pay attention.

33
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,279
In Shanghai...

34
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:02,873
you have to learn what to do.

35
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:04,470
Listen carefully.

36
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,368
Do everything I say.

37
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,664
-Got it?
-Got it.

38
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:22,150
All outsiders get searched here.

39
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,944
This is Shuisheng.
He's from the country.

40
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:31,539
This is where the Boss lives.

41
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,233
You're so dirty
we'll go in the backway.

42
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:40,528
I'll show you
around the house later.

43
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:43,425
All the kids in our family...

44
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:46,521
want to come here to get rich...

45
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:49,617
but you're the only one
I recommended.

46
00:07:49,717 --> 00:07:51,316
Don't let me down!

47
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,311
It's good to be rich.

48
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:56,909
Rich?

49
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,607
You know what "rich" means?

50
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:02,403
Any place in Shanghai...

51
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:05,699
if the Boss wants it...

52
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,197
he gets it.

53
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:10,992
The money that goes
through the Tang family's hands--

54
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:12,291
Unbelievable!

55
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,187
I'd start up a small shop.

56
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,885
You really are a bumpkin!

57
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:19,882
You know why you are here?

58
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:21,780
Because your name is Tang.

59
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,277
The boss trusts nobody...

60
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:26,874
except members of our family.

61
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:31,468
Scrub yourself all over.

62
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:34,466
You'll be serving
a young lady.

63
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:37,761
She's the Boss's mistress.

64
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:42,656
He's made her
the queen of Shanghai.

65
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:49,648
I don't know
what he sees in her myself.

66
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:52,744
Her name is Bijou.
Her sign is the Snake.

67
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:55,440
The boss told me that.

68
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:59,436
You'll have to work hard.

69
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:01,433
Got it?

70
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:02,532
Got it.

71
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:47,479
Eat up!

72
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,477
You've never seen this?

73
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:51,874
It's called ice cream.

74
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:56,968
This is the Boss's club.
It's the hot spot.

75
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,127
Look that's Bijou!

76
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:43,314
Pretending you're pretending

77
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:47,109
Don't bother pretending

78
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:50,804
Look
You can't wait to look at me

79
00:10:50,904 --> 00:10:54,201
Don't be shy take a good look

80
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:57,097
Don't look so serious

81
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:01,991
Don't look so distant

82
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:05,687
Don't look so serious

83
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:09,083
Don't look so distant

84
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:16,774
Serious shy it's all an act

85
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:20,470
Your eyes have already been
all over me

86
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,266
From head to toe all over me

87
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:27,262
You've secretly looked
all over me

88
00:11:57,726 --> 00:12:01,122
Embarrassed embarrassed

89
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,718
Why be embarrassed

90
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:08,114
You think you love me
You want to love me

91
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:11,909
What a tramp!

92
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:16,404
The Boss sent his wife away
because of her.

93
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:19,301
Who would dare to go near her?

94
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,793
Now she's with the Boss
she doesn't smile at anyone.

95
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:30,588
She really thinks
she's the queen of the stage!

96
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:32,984
If the Boss dropped her...

97
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:36,380
she'd be out on the streets.

98
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,777
What a slut!

99
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:45,470
On my body
I can feel your eyes

100
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,166
Roving up roving down

101
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:52,661
On my body
I can feel your eyes

102
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:08,842
Shuisheng! Let's go.

103
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:15,135
Got that?
You must call her " Miss."

104
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:19,030
From now on
you're her servant.

105
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,115
Miss...

106
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:36,510
Say " Miss."

107
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:38,008
Miss.

108
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:42,303
Come here.

109
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:49,894
Turn around.

110
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,683
Pretty hips!

111
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:04,777
No wonder the clients
are all over you.

112
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:12,667
Did that old man feel you up
without paying?

113
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:22,356
So you hid it!
Stuff it inside you I'd still find it.

114
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:25,952
You know the rule.

115
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:27,849
Your ass is your own...

116
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:30,347
but if you get fondled in here...

117
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:33,543
the money is for me.

118
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:35,141
That's the rule.

119
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,839
Miss...

120
00:14:41,234 --> 00:14:43,231
All right.

121
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,228
Since it's the first time...

122
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:49,824
I'll give you the money back.

123
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,120
Thank you Miss.

124
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,514
But I hate to break the rules...

125
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:01,310
so no wages.

126
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,706
That will teach you.
Get lost!

127
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:18,689
So this time
I get a little rooster!

128
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:19,888
Come here.

129
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:34,071
How old are you?

130
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:35,870
Fourteen.

131
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,466
Fourteen?

132
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:42,063
Have you slept with a girl yet?

133
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:43,760
Miss...

134
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,858
Yes I have.

135
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,154
You have?

136
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:52,151
Who with?

137
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,047
My ma when I was small.

138
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:01,140
Your ma when you were small!

139
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,334
What's your name?

140
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:07,931
Shuisheng.

141
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:13,425
Your last name?
Let him answer!

142
00:16:15,123 --> 00:16:16,622
Tang.

143
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,818
My last name is Tang.

144
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:22,016
Tang?

145
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:26,610
So you're a Tang.

146
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:34,600
Shuisheng
give me a light.

147
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:49,383
It's a cigarette lighter.

148
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:06,163
Smart kid. He learns fast.

149
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:45,117
What's the matter with you?

150
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:51,111
It's not hard. Blockhead!

151
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:56,604
Forgive him Miss.
My apologies.

152
00:17:57,104 --> 00:17:59,001
Forget it.

153
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:02,897
Apologies from a Tang?
That's new.

154
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:05,993
The Boss is waiting.

155
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,666
Shuisheng! Follow Miss.

156
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,457
The Boss is already here
Miss.

157
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:40,153
He's upstairs
with Mr. Song and Mr. Zheng.

158
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:48,442
You must take her coat.

159
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,738
Don't step on it!

160
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:54,635
Mustn't get it dirty.

161
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:57,233
Take her hat too.

162
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,829
Right hand is for the coat.
Left hand is for the hat.

163
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:01,428
That's the rule.

164
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:05,323
Remember the way.

165
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:09,518
Whenever Miss comes here...

166
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:11,616
you must serve her well.

167
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:15,811
Walk behind her.
Not too near not too far.

168
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:19,107
Don't ever walk ahead of her.

169
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:24,500
Walk silently
but let her know you're there.

170
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:30,094
Serve her well
you'll make a good living.

171
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:30,993
Got it?

172
00:19:31,592 --> 00:19:33,191
Got it.

173
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:46,575
Shall I tell the Boss
you're here Miss?

174
00:19:55,264 --> 00:19:58,561
When she goes into her bedroom...

175
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:02,556
you must stand here
by the door.

176
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:04,853
See those chairs?

177
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,050
Don't sit on them.
They're not for you.

178
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,845
You must stay standing up.
Don't doze off!

179
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:16,240
Ifthe Boss or Miss
wants some food or drinks...

180
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,436
hurry out there and tell them.

181
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:26,528
Everything is there.

182
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:28,526
If they ask for something...

183
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:30,723
bring it at once. Got it?

184
00:20:30,822 --> 00:20:32,121
Got it.

185
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:33,520
Put it on the sofa.

186
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,616
Stand there and let me see.

187
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:50,499
This way a little.

188
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:53,396
Bow your head.

189
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:55,094
Not bad.

190
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:56,992
Don't forget...

191
00:20:57,092 --> 00:20:59,788
if you want to look
at something...

192
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:02,585
do it discreetly.

193
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:04,383
Don't stare...

194
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:08,778
or you'll end up
looking like an idiot.

195
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:12,274
Don't complain.

196
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:16,269
In a few years you'll be somebody
in Shanghai!

197
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:20,264
Being a Tang
will change your life.

198
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,663
Got it?

199
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:23,261
Got it.

200
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:25,058
The Boss is in there.

201
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,552
Take a good look.

202
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,649
If he's talking business
in that room...

203
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:35,946
like now...

204
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:37,744
don't go in.

205
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:40,740
Wait out here.

206
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:43,138
The Boss always says...

207
00:21:43,238 --> 00:21:48,032
"Women's business
is nothing but wind.

208
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:51,627
Men's business however
small is important."

209
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:59,119
He's the most powerful boss
in Shanghai.

210
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:03,714
Always remember
everyone who works here...

211
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:06,110
is a Tang.

212
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,405
If your name is Tang
the Boss will be good to you.

213
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:14,101
See how lucy you are?

214
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:19,894
That's Mr. Song.
You saw him before.

215
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:23,191
The Boss thinks very highly of him.

216
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,385
They call him
the Boss's right-hand man.

217
00:22:28,784 --> 00:22:33,778
He's shrewd and sharp.
Sharp as a knife!

218
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:37,873
The other one the fat man
is Mr. Zheng.

219
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:42,468
He's the Boss's favorite.

220
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:47,662
He's a tough man of action.
He has a violent temper.

221
00:22:47,762 --> 00:22:51,557
When he gets mad
all of Shanghai behaves!

222
00:22:51,757 --> 00:22:53,155
Shanghai behaves!

223
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:55,952
The old man is Mr. Tang.

224
00:22:56,351 --> 00:23:01,046
He's the Boss's cousin
and private secretary.

225
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:03,643
The Boss trusts him
implicitly.

226
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:08,837
He handles all the family business.

227
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:10,235
All of it.

228
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:16,727
Song Zheng and I
had equal rank in the family.

229
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:20,622
Then a few years ago
there was a gang war at the docks.

230
00:23:20,722 --> 00:23:24,119
The Boss saved
Song's and Zheng's lives.

231
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:26,316
With secret rituals...

232
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:29,113
they became blood brothers.

233
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:32,009
You know what that means?

234
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:38,402
That's how the Boss
controls his empire!

235
00:23:55,182 --> 00:23:59,877
Mr. Yu? One moment please.

236
00:24:06,269 --> 00:24:09,765
That's a telephone.
It's a call for the Boss.

237
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,161
When he's on the telephone
we move away...

238
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:16,757
so as not to disturb him.

239
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,555
Remember that!

240
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:28,143
Mr. Yu!

241
00:24:28,943 --> 00:24:30,740
How are you?

242
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,637
Yes it's been a while!

243
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:37,732
I'm sorry I missed
your son's birthday party.

244
00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:42,127
I had to go to Suzhou on business.

245
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:48,220
Yes.

246
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,116
Of course I'll see to it.

247
00:24:52,914 --> 00:24:54,313
Yes.

248
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,398
Song!

249
00:25:07,397 --> 00:25:09,395
What's all this about?

250
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:12,691
Why did you fight
with those punks?

251
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:13,890
What happened?

252
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:18,085
He broke his promises.

253
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,681
He ignored the Boss's orders...

254
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:23,179
so I killed him.

255
00:25:24,178 --> 00:25:26,075
Is that all it was?

256
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:28,572
Just one man killed?

257
00:25:28,672 --> 00:25:31,369
We can pay to keep it quiet.

258
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:34,765
Song did it to avenge your honor.

259
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:37,162
When you wash your pants...

260
00:25:37,262 --> 00:25:40,359
you clean it up or it stinks.

261
00:25:44,054 --> 00:25:47,050
Deal with it.
I'll go see Yu.

262
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:50,247
Boss are you serious?

263
00:25:50,647 --> 00:25:52,744
Is it really that bad?

264
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:55,840
We can't let Fat Yu lose face.

265
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,437
I should be the one to go.

266
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:01,034
Take some men with you.

267
00:26:01,134 --> 00:26:02,732
Fat Yu has no balls.

268
00:26:02,832 --> 00:26:06,827
Go with the Boss
and take some men.

269
00:26:07,826 --> 00:26:09,325
Boss...

270
00:26:09,424 --> 00:26:13,420
this is Shuisheng
Miss's new servant.

271
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,215
He's the third nephew
of a close cousin of yours.

272
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:19,613
-Say "boss."
-Boss.

273
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:26,704
Boss!

274
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:30,800
What are you doing here?

275
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:33,496
Don't you want me here?

276
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:35,094
How can you think that?

277
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,392
Let me see you.

278
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:43,884
Like a real goddess!

279
00:26:45,982 --> 00:26:47,579
I don't see much of you.

280
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:52,074
Don't worry Treasure.
I'll be right back.

281
00:26:52,174 --> 00:26:56,968
May I ask... Which bitch
are you going to see now?

282
00:26:57,068 --> 00:26:59,665
I'm going to see Fat Yu.

283
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:01,064
Is that a new perfume?

284
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:05,159
All right then take off your rings.

285
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:09,654
Afraid I'll give them
to another woman?

286
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:12,050
All right I'll take them off.

287
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,046
I would give them
to no one but you.

288
00:27:16,146 --> 00:27:17,344
Here Treasure.

289
00:27:18,643 --> 00:27:23,537
You can have them.
Take them.

290
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:28,331
You're all witnesses.

291
00:27:28,431 --> 00:27:30,729
I'm not after his money.

292
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:33,925
I'm taking his rings
to keep them safe.

293
00:27:34,025 --> 00:27:37,520
Do that. Keep them safe!

294
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:41,915
Boss the car is ready.

295
00:27:42,814 --> 00:27:45,611
See? This is important.

296
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:48,008
I'll be back soon.

297
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:53,502
We mustn't let Fat Yu
lose face.

298
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:56,499
We can't do that to him!

299
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:58,895
Kiss me.

300
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:09,583
I'll be waiting!

301
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:31,856
Can't you knock?
Bumpkin! Get out!

302
00:28:32,256 --> 00:28:34,254
Go out and knock!

303
00:28:43,643 --> 00:28:45,741
Who is it?

304
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:47,138
Me.

305
00:28:47,538 --> 00:28:49,636
Who is "me"?

306
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:51,634
Shuisheng.

307
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,331
Knock again...

308
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:57,226
and say
"Shuisheng the bumpkin."

309
00:29:00,423 --> 00:29:02,121
Who is it?

310
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,917
Shuisheng the bumpkin.

311
00:29:06,616 --> 00:29:10,911
Say your first and last names.
Knock again!

312
00:29:14,507 --> 00:29:16,105
Who is it?

313
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:20,300
Tang Shuisheng the bumpkin.

314
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,296
Come in.

315
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:29,289
Put it on the table.

316
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:32,385
What are you staring at?

317
00:29:43,872 --> 00:29:44,771
Who is it?

318
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:48,766
It's me Miss. Liu.

319
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:51,963
The Boss won't be coming home.

320
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:54,559
He's playing mah-jongg
with Fat Yu.

321
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,957
He'll be busy for some days.

322
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:58,954
So if you want to--

323
00:29:59,054 --> 00:30:00,752
I'm going home.

324
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:07,744
Bumpkin!
I'll deal with you later.

325
00:30:23,126 --> 00:30:25,124
See this house?

326
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:29,618
The Boss gave it to Miss
for her birthday.

327
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:34,512
You're going to live here.
Lucky boy!

328
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,296
That's Shuisheng.

329
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,892
He'll sleep in the room
under the stairs.

330
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,078
She can't speak.

331
00:31:04,177 --> 00:31:07,574
Guess who cut out her tongue.

332
00:31:07,673 --> 00:31:09,671
But she can hear.

333
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:16,863
You sleep here.

334
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:19,859
That's the bell.

335
00:31:20,658 --> 00:31:25,453
When it rings it means Miss
is calling for you.

336
00:31:25,652 --> 00:31:27,451
Remember that.

337
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:29,548
When it rings...

338
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:32,743
even if you're peeing stop.

339
00:31:32,843 --> 00:31:38,037
Go to Miss at once
and take her orders.

340
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:43,031
When she speaks to you
bow your head.

341
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:48,825
Pay attention.
Keep your ears wide open.

342
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:54,218
- Got it?
- I want to leave.

343
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,214
Shuisheng!

344
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:00,012
I want to leave!

345
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,106
You didn't come here
to do nothing!

346
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:07,803
And who will pay for the mirror?

347
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:09,900
Now listen.

348
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,395
For country folk like us
finding work in the city...

349
00:32:14,994 --> 00:32:16,693
isn't easy.

350
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:21,587
I sweated blood
to get where I am.

351
00:32:21,687 --> 00:32:22,885
I worked damn hard!

352
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:27,880
Work well or I'll send you
back to the country.

353
00:32:28,778 --> 00:32:30,376
Got it?

354
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:32,574
Got it.

355
00:32:33,272 --> 00:32:35,670
If you ever say "no" again...

356
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:39,066
I'll throw you in the river!

357
00:32:40,065 --> 00:32:41,863
Go to bed.

358
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,958
Miss!

359
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:50,652
I've taught him a lesson.
Don't worry.

360
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:53,948
I'm going home now.

361
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,953
SECOND DAY

362
00:37:09,149 --> 00:37:12,744
Faraway
the clouds are fading

363
00:37:12,844 --> 00:37:16,539
My lover appears in the moonlight

364
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:23,731
Tonight we are happy
together again

365
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:31,222
On the crystal water
swims a pair of ducks

366
00:37:31,422 --> 00:37:38,314
Green leaves red petals
The lotus flowers open

367
00:37:38,614 --> 00:37:45,905
A pair of ducks
and you and I together

368
00:37:46,105 --> 00:37:53,396
The playful breeze
caresses the flowers

369
00:37:53,696 --> 00:38:00,887
And our love lights up the world

370
00:38:30,652 --> 00:38:34,149
Far away
the clouds are fading

371
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:37,844
My lover appears in the moonlight

372
00:38:38,044 --> 00:38:44,936
Tonight we are happy
Together again

373
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:52,527
On the crystal water
swims a pair of ducks

374
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:59,819
Green leaves red petals
the lotus flowers open

375
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:04,513
A pair of ducks

376
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:07,409
And you and I together

377
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:14,801
The playful breeze
caresses the flowers

378
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:18,296
And our love

379
00:39:18,496 --> 00:39:22,092
Lights up the world

380
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:23,890
A pair of--

381
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,987
What is it?

382
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:32,380
The Boss hates " Moonlight."

383
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,278
Everyone knows that...

384
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:36,874
yet she sings it
when he's here!

385
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,073
Change the song!

386
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:39,971
Play " Pretending."

387
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:43,067
Get changed quick!

388
00:39:46,563 --> 00:39:48,061
Miss!

389
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:52,056
The Boss is here
with Song and Zheng.

390
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:56,551
They've come with Fat Yu
to hear you sing.

391
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,647
Please get changed quickly.

392
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:04,742
Fat Yu? That fat pig!

393
00:40:05,242 --> 00:40:07,139
Please hurry.

394
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:11,034
Shuisheng
bring me the red dress.

395
00:40:15,828 --> 00:40:19,325
Hurry up!
It's next to the green one.

396
00:40:28,314 --> 00:40:31,610
The red one!
Don't you understand?

397
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,708
Have you ever seen blood?

398
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:35,106
Bumpkin!

399
00:40:36,104 --> 00:40:39,201
Can't you do anything right?

400
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:43,097
They've stuck me with a moron!

401
00:40:43,296 --> 00:40:44,595
A half-wit!

402
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:47,491
Calm down Miss.
I'll help you.

403
00:40:47,591 --> 00:40:48,790
Buzz off.

404
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:55,582
Pretending you're pretending

405
00:40:55,682 --> 00:40:58,479
Don't bother pretending

406
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:03,173
You can't wait to look at me

407
00:41:03,273 --> 00:41:06,768
Don't be shy take a good look

408
00:41:06,868 --> 00:41:09,865
Don't bother pretending

409
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,257
We have the same tastes!

410
00:41:26,645 --> 00:41:30,941
Mr. Yu do you think
she sings well?

411
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:36,035
She looks better
than she sings!

412
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:41,527
I love it
when she sings this song.

413
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:45,524
A lot of people sing it...

414
00:41:45,623 --> 00:41:47,920
but not as well as her.

415
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,418
Listen. Listen carefully.

416
00:41:50,518 --> 00:41:52,515
It comes and goes...

417
00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:55,512
as softly
as a goose's feather right?

418
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:57,709
Yes it's interesting.

419
00:41:57,809 --> 00:41:59,707
Isn't it!

420
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:13,490
Embarrassed embarrassed

421
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:17,186
Why be embarrassed?

422
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:20,982
You think you love me
You want to love me

423
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:24,677
So come right out and say it

424
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:27,973
Don't look so serious

425
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:32,168
Don't look so distant

426
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:36,064
Don't look so serious

427
00:42:36,164 --> 00:42:39,660
Don't look so distant

428
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:46,751
You're blushing
Your heart is beating

429
00:42:46,851 --> 00:42:50,647
I can tell
you're consumed by desire

430
00:42:50,847 --> 00:42:54,242
Roving up roving down

431
00:42:54,342 --> 00:42:57,838
All over my body
I feel your eyes

432
00:42:57,938 --> 00:43:01,634
Roving up roving down

433
00:43:01,733 --> 00:43:05,629
All over my body
I feel your eyes

434
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:37,991
Get lost!

435
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,589
Fuck off!

436
00:43:40,189 --> 00:43:41,787
Don't ever come back!

437
00:43:41,887 --> 00:43:43,684
Didn't you ever care for me?

438
00:43:43,784 --> 00:43:46,082
Bastard! Pig!

439
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,078
Who do you think I am?

440
00:43:49,178 --> 00:43:51,875
You treat me like a whore!

441
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:07,656
You lousy bastard!

442
00:44:09,054 --> 00:44:10,753
Drop dead!

443
00:44:10,853 --> 00:44:16,146
Just because you fucked me
you think you're the boss?

444
00:44:16,846 --> 00:44:19,342
Don't kid yourself!

445
00:44:22,938 --> 00:44:27,432
Don't you know
who the boss is in Shanghai?

446
00:44:41,716 --> 00:44:48,008
I'm the boss now.
Drop dead bastard!

447
00:45:00,394 --> 00:45:04,289
Go fuck yourself!

448
00:45:06,987 --> 00:45:09,583
Who do you think you are?
What are you?

449
00:45:09,783 --> 00:45:13,978
A jerk! A fucking jerk!

450
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:19,971
You want to play
at being the boss?

451
00:46:09,213 --> 00:46:15,106
THIRD DAY

452
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:17,204
I beg you go away

453
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:25,594
Go quickly far away

454
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:34,383
Your heart hard as rock

455
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:39,377
Your heart has me
under its spell

456
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:47,968
I beg you go away

457
00:46:50,564 --> 00:46:53,960
Go quickly

458
00:46:55,459 --> 00:46:57,756
Far away

459
00:46:59,454 --> 00:47:05,847
Your heart hard as rock

460
00:47:06,546 --> 00:47:10,641
Your heart has me
under its spell

461
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:19,730
You have consumed my heart

462
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:24,225
You have consumed my body

463
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:28,819
Your heart hard as rock

464
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:33,713
You have no heart

465
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:51,093
You have consumed my heart

466
00:47:51,293 --> 00:47:55,688
You have consumed my body

467
00:47:55,888 --> 00:48:00,282
Your heart hard as a rock

468
00:48:00,382 --> 00:48:05,077
You have no heart

469
00:48:30,347 --> 00:48:35,241
SHANG HAI - PARI S

470
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:43,931
SHANG HAI - U.S.A.

471
00:49:05,406 --> 00:49:11,299
It's a big party
All the guests are here

472
00:49:11,399 --> 00:49:17,092
Men and women happy together

473
00:49:17,392 --> 00:49:19,889
You're too good
at mah-jongg Mr. Yu!

474
00:49:19,988 --> 00:49:22,086
You're too modest.

475
00:49:22,186 --> 00:49:25,982
Tell Miss I'm going to Mr. Yu's
for mah-jongg.

476
00:49:26,281 --> 00:49:29,078
I'll be back late.
Tell her to wait at home.

477
00:49:29,177 --> 00:49:30,576
Yes tell her to wait!

478
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,274
After you.

479
00:51:59,002 --> 00:52:00,599
Uncle Liu! Uncle Liu!

480
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:16,881
Here's the Boss.

481
00:52:29,366 --> 00:52:30,764
Boss...

482
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:32,762
his eyes are still open.

483
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:42,151
Let him go.

484
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:48,544
Fat Yu's gang did it.

485
00:52:48,843 --> 00:52:52,039
Your uncle died protecting me.

486
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:57,133
Take a good look.
His open eyes cry out for vengeance.

487
00:53:43,978 --> 00:53:45,776
Get up! Get up!

488
00:53:58,961 --> 00:54:02,656
It's so early! Where are we going?
I've nothing with me!

489
00:54:02,756 --> 00:54:05,054
Shuisheng get in!

490
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:07,850
Hurry!

491
00:54:09,948 --> 00:54:11,545
Get going!

492
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:38,914
FOURTH DAY

493
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,677
This is boring me to death.

494
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:15,571
Why leave home so early
just to sit around in a dirty boat?

495
00:55:15,671 --> 00:55:18,167
Not even allowed outside!

496
00:55:18,267 --> 00:55:22,562
Where are we going
sneaking away like thieves?

497
00:55:22,862 --> 00:55:25,859
We're going to a small island Miss.

498
00:55:25,959 --> 00:55:28,555
An island nobody knows.

499
00:55:28,655 --> 00:55:30,553
Nobody?

500
00:55:30,853 --> 00:55:32,650
What's on this island?

501
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:35,148
Just a widow and her daughter.

502
00:55:35,647 --> 00:55:39,942
There are safe places in Shanghai.
Why do we have to go there?

503
00:55:40,342 --> 00:55:41,240
I'm not going!

504
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:43,637
You are like it or not.

505
00:55:43,737 --> 00:55:45,136
You know the rule.

506
00:55:56,123 --> 00:56:00,218
Miss once we're on the island
you must stay calm.

507
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:02,215
Don't wander off.

508
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:06,410
Anyone landing or leaving
without permission will be killed.

509
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,907
Those are the Boss's orders.

510
00:56:10,007 --> 00:56:13,602
We haven't even told
Song and Zheng.

511
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,097
It isn't far from Shanghai.

512
00:56:18,197 --> 00:56:21,892
If people know we're there
they'll come and kill us.

513
00:56:21,992 --> 00:56:24,290
Is it that bad?

514
00:56:25,988 --> 00:56:28,385
That's how it is.

515
00:56:28,684 --> 00:56:33,179
So many people in Shanghai
are jealous of me.

516
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:37,274
They all want
to take my place in bed.

517
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:39,102
The older you get
the more you know about pain.

518
00:57:39,202 --> 00:57:42,297
Shuisheng! Fetch the red box.

519
00:57:42,397 --> 00:57:45,994
Be careful.
It's the Boss's medicine.

520
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,567
Where do I sleep?

521
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:11,664
In the next room.

522
00:58:12,362 --> 00:58:15,259
We have to talk business
with the Boss.

523
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:20,653
Unless it's urgent
don't bother us for the next few days.

524
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:23,549
Urgent? In this place?

525
00:58:23,649 --> 00:58:25,847
There's nothing to do here!

526
00:58:26,346 --> 00:58:28,943
Will you stop complaining?

527
00:58:38,332 --> 00:58:42,028
Shuisheng get rid of those swabs.

528
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:51,517
Not in the sea.
Bury them.

529
00:58:52,016 --> 00:58:55,212
All our rubbish must be buried.

530
00:58:55,312 --> 00:58:57,209
Don't forget it.

531
00:59:45,253 --> 00:59:50,947
FIFTH DAY

532
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,997
Your lunch.

533
01:00:36,693 --> 01:00:38,990
Put it on the table.

534
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:45,183
In the country we eat very plainly.

535
01:00:45,283 --> 01:00:48,878
It's exactly
what we and the Boss want.

536
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:55,670
What a sweet little girl.

537
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,369
She's had lunch sir.

538
01:01:00,165 --> 01:01:01,664
What's your name?

539
01:01:01,764 --> 01:01:02,961
Ajiao.

540
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:04,460
And your mommy?

541
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,258
Cuihua.

542
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:15,048
How old are you?

543
01:01:15,147 --> 01:01:18,144
-Nine.
-Nine? That's nice.

544
01:01:23,837 --> 01:01:26,534
Cuihua wait here.

545
01:01:37,522 --> 01:01:39,619
Is she your daughter?

546
01:01:39,818 --> 01:01:42,616
Yes. Her name is Ajiao.

547
01:01:44,713 --> 01:01:49,307
She's cute.
She has a pretty nose pretty eyes.

548
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:53,003
You think she looks like you?

549
01:01:53,203 --> 01:01:57,698
She looks more like
a child of mine.

550
01:01:58,097 --> 01:02:00,794
Ajiao come here.

551
01:02:08,384 --> 01:02:13,280
Who is prettier?
Your mother or me?

552
01:02:16,975 --> 01:02:19,571
What doyou want to be
when you grow up?

553
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,068
Come on tell me.

554
01:02:23,966 --> 01:02:25,665
I want to be like you.

555
01:02:25,764 --> 01:02:26,863
Ajiao!

556
01:02:32,657 --> 01:02:35,753
Have you been living here long?

557
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:37,751
Several years.

558
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:41,047
How can anybody live here?

559
01:02:41,546 --> 01:02:46,041
I'm bored to death
after just one day.

560
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:25,794
Shuisheng! Do you know
where Miss is going?

561
01:03:26,593 --> 01:03:28,591
Go with her!

562
01:03:28,691 --> 01:03:33,685
Take an umbrella it's starting to rain.
Do you hear me?

563
01:03:33,884 --> 01:03:38,180
Shuisheng! Are you asleep?
Get up!

564
01:03:38,479 --> 01:03:41,276
Shuisheng! Get up! Quick!

565
01:04:25,823 --> 01:04:27,322
Buzz off!

566
01:04:27,921 --> 01:04:29,818
Go on go away!

567
01:04:53,391 --> 01:04:55,288
Open up!

568
01:04:56,387 --> 01:04:57,986
Who is it?

569
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:01,082
It's me. I need you.

570
01:05:01,581 --> 01:05:04,677
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

571
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:06,975
Open up!

572
01:05:08,573 --> 01:05:11,769
Are you counting your money
or what?

573
01:05:11,869 --> 01:05:14,367
I haven't come to borrow money!

574
01:05:16,064 --> 01:05:18,761
You took your time!

575
01:05:19,261 --> 01:05:21,857
-Were you asleep?
-Yes.

576
01:05:22,557 --> 01:05:24,853
On your own?

577
01:05:25,453 --> 01:05:27,551
Ajiao's sleeping too.

578
01:05:33,544 --> 01:05:36,540
I can't sleep on my own...

579
01:05:37,239 --> 01:05:40,235
so I came to talk to you.

580
01:05:41,534 --> 01:05:43,532
What about?

581
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:47,228
Oh we'll think of something.

582
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:58,115
If you don't want to never mind.

583
01:05:58,215 --> 01:06:01,011
I'll go. I'm going.

584
01:06:06,305 --> 01:06:08,802
Can I borrow some clothes?

585
01:06:08,902 --> 01:06:13,297
All mine are being washed.
I have nothing to wear.

586
01:06:13,797 --> 01:06:16,693
I have only peasant's clothes.

587
01:06:16,992 --> 01:06:18,891
They'll do fine.

588
01:06:19,889 --> 01:06:20,688
Miss!

589
01:06:25,882 --> 01:06:29,578
See how ignorant I am
about countryways?

590
01:06:29,678 --> 01:06:32,974
Walking into your bedroom
uninvited!

591
01:06:33,274 --> 01:06:35,271
Do sit down.

592
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:37,668
No no.

593
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:41,064
Thanks.

594
01:06:44,061 --> 01:06:46,857
Give me any old thing.

595
01:06:52,351 --> 01:06:54,848
Don't worry. Take your time.

596
01:06:55,247 --> 01:06:59,743
Besides I've got nothing else to do.

597
01:06:59,843 --> 01:07:02,739
I can't sleep on my own.

598
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:12,128
Here! I've found something.

599
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:20,118
You sew very well.

600
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:25,611
If I were a man
I'd marry you myself.

601
01:07:25,711 --> 01:07:29,408
I wouldn't leave you
in somebody else's arms!

602
01:07:40,294 --> 01:07:43,291
I really have to go.

603
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:47,986
Since you sleep alone
be sure to lock the door!

604
01:07:49,984 --> 01:07:52,980
I beg you go away

605
01:07:54,378 --> 01:07:57,874
Go quickly far away

606
01:07:57,974 --> 01:08:02,468
Go quickly far away

607
01:08:06,463 --> 01:08:12,357
SIXTH DAY

608
01:08:39,425 --> 01:08:42,122
Are those Mommy's clothes?

609
01:08:42,521 --> 01:08:44,120
Aren't they pretty?

610
01:08:44,419 --> 01:08:45,318
Yes!

611
01:08:46,217 --> 01:08:49,114
So pretty I'm going to keep them.

612
01:08:49,214 --> 01:08:51,510
I'm swapping clothes with her.

613
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:54,707
Now you can call me " Mommy"...

614
01:08:54,807 --> 01:08:58,702
and you can call her " Miss."

615
01:09:00,601 --> 01:09:03,097
Teach me to sing.

616
01:09:03,197 --> 01:09:07,492
Shuisheng says
you sing very well.

617
01:09:09,989 --> 01:09:13,385
Ajiao can you sing?

618
01:09:13,485 --> 01:09:15,982
I only know one song.

619
01:09:16,381 --> 01:09:19,878
Then sing it for me.

620
01:09:19,978 --> 01:09:21,775
Go on sing!

621
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:24,872
If you sing well
I'll give you lessons.

622
01:09:26,269 --> 01:09:30,765
Come on get up and sing!
Up you get!

623
01:09:34,261 --> 01:09:35,360
Sing!

624
01:09:40,952 --> 01:09:42,750
Sing!

625
01:09:44,049 --> 01:09:48,144
Beddy-bye beddy-bye
Over Grandma's bridge

626
01:09:48,244 --> 01:09:52,239
Grandma says I'm good as gold

627
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,337
I know how to laugh

628
01:09:54,437 --> 01:09:56,334
I know how to cry

629
01:09:56,434 --> 01:10:00,530
Two yellow dogs carry the litter

630
01:10:04,425 --> 01:10:07,821
On the bridge
the birds are tweeting

631
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,618
Do you know this song?

632
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,913
My grandma sang it to me
when I was little.

633
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:18,708
In her red trousers
and coat of brocade

634
01:10:18,808 --> 01:10:22,404
Grandma takes me to the litter

635
01:10:22,504 --> 01:10:26,399
Beddy-bye beddy-bye
Over Grandma's bridge

636
01:10:38,785 --> 01:10:41,581
Sing Shuisheng. All together!

637
01:11:31,223 --> 01:11:34,219
So what
if I had him killed?

638
01:11:35,019 --> 01:11:37,615
I gave the orders.

639
01:11:37,715 --> 01:11:40,812
Nobody lands or leaves
without permission.

640
01:11:40,912 --> 01:11:42,409
He didn't bother you!

641
01:11:42,509 --> 01:11:46,605
That's not my problem!
We have to be careful.

642
01:11:49,102 --> 01:11:51,898
Stop making such a fuss!

643
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:56,992
If you minded your own business
he would still be alive.

644
01:11:57,392 --> 01:11:59,090
To tell you the truth...

645
01:11:59,789 --> 01:12:04,284
if you had kept quiet last night
I'd have been none the wiser.

646
01:12:05,982 --> 01:12:07,880
I owe you my thanks.

647
01:12:08,179 --> 01:12:11,875
Whom are you trying to blame?
Not me!

648
01:12:11,975 --> 01:12:13,673
It's all your fault!

649
01:12:53,926 --> 01:12:55,524
Stop.

650
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:02,116
Did you hear me
and the Boss arguing?

651
01:13:03,015 --> 01:13:06,511
The Tang family is all bad.

652
01:13:14,701 --> 01:13:17,298
Can't you sleep?

653
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:22,591
Then stay and talk to me.

654
01:13:28,385 --> 01:13:31,881
Do you know how to climb trees?

655
01:13:32,181 --> 01:13:33,479
Yes.

656
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,175
When I was a girl...

657
01:13:37,274 --> 01:13:39,972
we had two trees in the yard.

658
01:13:40,071 --> 01:13:41,670
Mulberry trees.

659
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:44,466
Very very tall ones.

660
01:13:44,566 --> 01:13:48,261
People say mulberry trees
in the yard...

661
01:13:48,361 --> 01:13:50,459
bring good luck.

662
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:56,053
Every summer
they bore lots offruit.

663
01:13:56,153 --> 01:13:58,649
People came to pick them.

664
01:13:59,049 --> 01:14:00,547
And I...

665
01:14:01,746 --> 01:14:06,441
I climbed up in the tree
and ate lots of them.

666
01:14:10,735 --> 01:14:14,731
See I'm a country bumpkin too.

667
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:18,226
Bijou the bumpkin.

668
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:21,323
Bijou the bumpkin!

669
01:14:35,007 --> 01:14:39,601
Other than your uncle
have you got any family in Shanghai?

670
01:14:56,082 --> 01:14:57,481
Take this.

671
01:14:58,379 --> 01:15:00,377
Take it!

672
01:15:11,464 --> 01:15:14,960
When you've saved up enough
to open a shop...

673
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,457
go back to the country.

674
01:15:17,856 --> 01:15:19,754
Shanghai is all bad.

675
01:15:20,353 --> 01:15:22,551
I want to avenge my uncle.

676
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,947
The Boss said his eyes cried out
for vengeance.

677
01:15:26,446 --> 01:15:30,342
Oh yeah?
So go back to Shanghai.

678
01:15:31,141 --> 01:15:34,736
Be like your uncle.
Go back to Shanghai and get killed.

679
01:15:34,836 --> 01:15:37,234
Go on go to bed.

680
01:16:20,483 --> 01:16:24,877
Cuihua this evening
you and I can have a chat.

681
01:16:32,769 --> 01:16:35,465
-Hello Miss!
-Hard at work?

682
01:16:36,364 --> 01:16:39,260
Take a seat Miss.

683
01:16:49,249 --> 01:16:51,247
How old are you?

684
01:16:51,446 --> 01:16:52,545
I'm a Horse.

685
01:16:52,645 --> 01:16:54,343
A Horse?

686
01:16:54,642 --> 01:16:56,940
You look much older!

687
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,936
Yet you're younger than me.

688
01:17:00,735 --> 01:17:04,730
When you look old
the mosquitos don't bite.

689
01:17:07,028 --> 01:17:09,325
Why don't you remarry?

690
01:17:11,822 --> 01:17:14,419
Surely there's somebody.

691
01:17:15,118 --> 01:17:19,513
There must be a man
in your life.

692
01:17:20,512 --> 01:17:22,410
I could find you one.

693
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:25,406
Uncle likes Mommy a lot.

694
01:17:25,506 --> 01:17:28,403
Ajiao! Go to bed.

695
01:17:35,894 --> 01:17:37,792
Who is Uncle?

696
01:17:38,491 --> 01:17:41,787
He lives on the island
across the way.

697
01:17:42,087 --> 01:17:43,585
Does he visit often?

698
01:17:43,684 --> 01:17:45,782
He comes by boat in the night.

699
01:17:45,882 --> 01:17:48,380
Ajiao! Go to bed!

700
01:17:54,971 --> 01:17:57,968
When are you getting married?

701
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:01,264
After the New Year.

702
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:09,154
Forget that man.

703
01:18:09,954 --> 01:18:12,551
Why live in the country?

704
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:17,246
Come to Shanghai with me.

705
01:18:17,345 --> 01:18:21,740
I'll find you a good husband.

706
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,735
You can keep Ajiao with you.

707
01:18:25,835 --> 01:18:28,632
If you don't want to
I'll keep her.

708
01:18:28,932 --> 01:18:31,129
I like that girl.

709
01:18:31,229 --> 01:18:33,926
What are you saying Miss?

710
01:18:34,425 --> 01:18:36,523
I mean it.

711
01:18:36,623 --> 01:18:39,619
I came here to talk about it.

712
01:18:41,517 --> 01:18:45,012
But I don't want to leave here.

713
01:18:49,607 --> 01:18:52,304
You really want to stay?

714
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,498
Well in that case...

715
01:18:57,698 --> 01:19:01,094
let me know
when you get married.

716
01:19:01,493 --> 01:19:04,389
I'll give you
a wedding trousseau.

717
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:09,483
I'll send clothes
for you and Ajiao...

718
01:19:09,883 --> 01:19:14,478
and I'll send
an opera company...

719
01:19:14,577 --> 01:19:16,576
to sing for you.

720
01:19:17,175 --> 01:19:19,771
You're making fun of me.

721
01:19:20,171 --> 01:19:22,569
Everything's planned.

722
01:19:22,669 --> 01:19:26,564
For the wedding
he'll simply move in here.

723
01:19:32,357 --> 01:19:36,352
You must have had
a grand wedding!

724
01:19:36,452 --> 01:19:39,448
Married me?

725
01:19:41,147 --> 01:19:43,844
It's too soon for that!

726
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:48,838
At your age
you ought to be married.

727
01:19:48,938 --> 01:19:53,832
Oh sure. I ought to.

728
01:19:54,132 --> 01:19:57,228
But I can't see who to.

729
01:19:57,328 --> 01:20:00,623
I don't know anyone worth it.

730
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:05,618
You have to be patient
with a man.

731
01:20:06,717 --> 01:20:10,612
Be sincere
and he will treat you right.

732
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:17,504
I've been sincere so many times.

733
01:20:19,202 --> 01:20:21,899
You'll find your Mr. Right.

734
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:27,692
Up to now I've been unlucky.

735
01:20:27,992 --> 01:20:33,585
Now I'm with her uncle
and I'm happy.

736
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:43,773
Cuihua...

737
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:48,268
I'm sorry.

738
01:20:49,567 --> 01:20:52,163
I shouldn't have come.

739
01:20:52,663 --> 01:20:55,958
What makes you say that?

740
01:20:57,357 --> 01:20:58,955
Really...

741
01:21:00,153 --> 01:21:02,751
I shouldn't have come.

742
01:21:05,247 --> 01:21:08,544
I shouldn't have come
to this island.

743
01:21:08,644 --> 01:21:10,941
I'm truly sorry.

744
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:02,580
Shuisheng!

745
01:22:12,169 --> 01:22:13,667
Were you waiting for me?

746
01:22:14,367 --> 01:22:16,664
I brought you the umbrella.

747
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:40,635
Shuisheng
you must not stay with me.

748
01:22:41,035 --> 01:22:43,932
I'm not good to you.

749
01:23:02,909 --> 01:23:08,703
SEVENTH DAY

750
01:23:21,687 --> 01:23:24,085
Are you Cuihua?

751
01:23:24,984 --> 01:23:26,781
How do you know my name?

752
01:23:26,981 --> 01:23:31,376
I've eaten your fish soup
so I know your name.

753
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:37,269
Are you Ajiao? Come here.

754
01:23:43,362 --> 01:23:44,461
Say "Grandpa."

755
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,258
Grandpa.

756
01:23:47,257 --> 01:23:49,954
You're pretty.

757
01:23:50,554 --> 01:23:54,449
You look like Bijou
as a little girl.

758
01:23:56,246 --> 01:23:58,744
Bijou!

759
01:23:59,143 --> 01:24:01,440
Go get Miss.

760
01:24:08,732 --> 01:24:09,931
Bijou!

761
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:13,826
Look at Ajiao.
She looks like you as a girl.

762
01:24:17,222 --> 01:24:22,116
Cuihua cook some fish.
We have guests tonight.

763
01:24:23,015 --> 01:24:24,214
Song and Zheng.

764
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:38,797
Got the shits again you little prick?
Serves you right...

765
01:24:38,897 --> 01:24:41,593
for staying outdoors all night!

766
01:24:41,693 --> 01:24:44,990
It's your fault
you've got the shits!

767
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:46,687
Move away!

768
01:24:46,887 --> 01:24:48,485
Move away!

769
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:03,926
Shit it's going to rain!

770
01:27:04,026 --> 01:27:08,320
Good. It will make the job easier.

771
01:27:09,419 --> 01:27:12,815
Doesn't Song mind
about killing Bijou?

772
01:27:12,915 --> 01:27:16,811
Do as you're told.
Don't complicate things.

773
01:27:16,911 --> 01:27:19,907
Remember.
Once the bitch is asleep...

774
01:27:20,007 --> 01:27:24,701
strangle her.
Be careful not to make any noise.

775
01:27:24,801 --> 01:27:27,897
- Song said to stab her.
- What's it to you?

776
01:27:28,097 --> 01:27:32,492
Just don't disfigure her.

777
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:37,286
It's raining.
Where do we hide?

778
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:38,685
In the water.

779
01:27:39,184 --> 01:27:42,980
It'll be easy.
There aren't many of them.

780
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:28,726
What's up Shuisheng?

781
01:28:30,624 --> 01:28:32,621
Don't you know the rule?

782
01:28:33,221 --> 01:28:35,518
Can't you see the Boss is here?

783
01:28:35,618 --> 01:28:37,915
If it's not urgent get out.

784
01:28:38,015 --> 01:28:41,711
Shuisheng? What's the matter?

785
01:28:42,111 --> 01:28:44,308
Miss! They want to kill you!

786
01:29:04,784 --> 01:29:08,979
Shuisheng calm down.
Take it easy.

787
01:29:09,078 --> 01:29:14,073
What did you hear?
What did you see?

788
01:29:14,372 --> 01:29:18,767
I heard two men.
They were planning to kill Miss.

789
01:29:18,867 --> 01:29:24,460
Shuisheng look at me.
Look at me! Explain yourself.

790
01:29:26,658 --> 01:29:30,154
I had the shits.
I was crouching down.

791
01:29:30,354 --> 01:29:32,452
- I heard two men.
- Saying what?

792
01:29:32,552 --> 01:29:36,846
They were going to kill Miss
with a knife.

793
01:29:37,246 --> 01:29:42,540
Shuisheng
who was going to kill Miss?

794
01:30:27,187 --> 01:30:31,082
How many men
did you come with Song?

795
01:30:36,776 --> 01:30:37,775
Two.

796
01:30:38,074 --> 01:30:42,669
That's a lie.
Two boats and 18 men right?

797
01:30:44,966 --> 01:30:46,764
Do you think Zheng is stupid?

798
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:52,557
Why did you bring so many men?

799
01:30:52,657 --> 01:30:54,554
Just to kill Bijou?

800
01:30:54,954 --> 01:30:57,352
What did she do to you?

801
01:31:00,348 --> 01:31:03,344
Why meddle in my private life?

802
01:31:07,739 --> 01:31:09,936
Don't you get it yet?

803
01:31:10,136 --> 01:31:12,034
Then I'll explain.

804
01:31:13,532 --> 01:31:16,829
See Song there looking so serious?

805
01:31:16,929 --> 01:31:19,625
He actually works for Fat Yu.

806
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:22,023
He came here...

807
01:31:22,222 --> 01:31:24,219
to kill us all.

808
01:31:29,114 --> 01:31:34,008
Do you think I've been twirling
my thumbs since we got here?

809
01:31:40,001 --> 01:31:41,999
On August 6th...

810
01:31:42,099 --> 01:31:45,395
after the police seized
those 80 packs of opium...

811
01:31:45,594 --> 01:31:49,989
the Boss invited
the customs officers to dinner.

812
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:52,587
That night
our man watching Song...

813
01:31:52,687 --> 01:31:57,681
saw him go to Miss's house
for the first time.

814
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:01,876
After that he went there often.
We have all the details.

815
01:32:02,575 --> 01:32:06,670
On the 3rd of this month
Fat Yu invited Song to dinner.

816
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:09,466
They met secretly at a restaurant.

817
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:12,963
The next evening the 4th...

818
01:32:13,063 --> 01:32:14,860
the Boss was attacked.

819
01:32:15,259 --> 01:32:21,253
Liu Agen Acha Aniu and Miaofa
were killed.

820
01:32:21,552 --> 01:32:24,349
The next day
the Boss came here to hide...

821
01:32:24,449 --> 01:32:27,346
protected by 40 of Zheng's men.

822
01:32:27,745 --> 01:32:32,340
Last night the Boss sent Zheng
to Shanghai...

823
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:35,835
to invite Song to come here alone.

824
01:32:35,935 --> 01:32:42,528
But 18 of Song's men
arrived after dark.

825
01:32:51,417 --> 01:32:53,115
Song...

826
01:32:54,313 --> 01:32:59,208
I knew that you and Fat Yu
were out to get me in Shanghai.

827
01:33:01,206 --> 01:33:02,305
I also knew that...

828
01:33:02,404 --> 01:33:08,298
when you got Zheng's message
you'd send men here to kill me.

829
01:33:08,697 --> 01:33:13,591
What Shuisheng overheard
we already knew.

830
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:16,787
I came to this godforsaken place...

831
01:33:16,887 --> 01:33:21,182
but the whole thing was planned...

832
01:33:21,282 --> 01:33:25,876
to set you up this evening.

833
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:31,670
Now do you see?

834
01:33:37,463 --> 01:33:39,062
Song...

835
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,857
do you want to see my wounds?

836
01:33:52,945 --> 01:33:56,640
Not one hole except my navel!

837
01:34:18,315 --> 01:34:19,913
Boss...

838
01:34:20,212 --> 01:34:24,208
you don't like
my " Moonlight" song.

839
01:34:27,604 --> 01:34:31,999
But Song often promised me...

840
01:34:32,498 --> 01:34:38,192
that once he had taken your place...

841
01:34:38,292 --> 01:34:41,488
I could sing it for him every day.

842
01:34:43,286 --> 01:34:47,980
He also said he would give me
the nightclub...

843
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:52,575
so I could listen
to other people sing.

844
01:34:53,574 --> 01:34:56,670
He promised
we'd get married in France...

845
01:34:56,770 --> 01:35:02,163
and I would sing " Moonlight"
for him on our wedding day.

846
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:05,159
Isn't that so Song?

847
01:35:12,651 --> 01:35:16,946
Far away the clouds are fading

848
01:35:17,046 --> 01:35:21,441
My lover appears in the moonlight

849
01:35:23,538 --> 01:35:27,434
I'll murder you! Bitch!
I'll kill you!

850
01:35:27,534 --> 01:35:29,532
Did you think I loved you?

851
01:35:29,731 --> 01:35:32,428
I loathe you!

852
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:38,521
Seeing you with that old wreck
made me sick!

853
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:43,715
You peasant bitch!
Who do you think you are?

854
01:35:43,815 --> 01:35:46,611
I never loved you!

855
01:35:46,811 --> 01:35:49,208
For the last five years...

856
01:35:49,308 --> 01:35:52,504
there wasn't a day
I didn't want to murder you.

857
01:35:53,803 --> 01:35:57,298
Listen Zheng and you too...

858
01:35:57,498 --> 01:35:59,596
listen to me!

859
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:01,893
I wanted to kill him
not for my sake...

860
01:36:02,792 --> 01:36:05,688
but for the sake
of the Tang family!

861
01:36:06,288 --> 01:36:10,083
With me in charge
think what we'd have done!

862
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:19,573
With me in charge
it would all be different!

863
01:36:19,773 --> 01:36:22,569
He's old. He's out of date!

864
01:36:50,535 --> 01:36:53,732
Shuisheng. There's no need
for you to stay.

865
01:36:53,832 --> 01:36:57,428
Go to bed. Go on.

866
01:37:01,323 --> 01:37:03,321
Run along.

867
01:37:11,911 --> 01:37:15,307
You can insult me all you like...

868
01:37:15,407 --> 01:37:20,600
but tonight we're going
to settle up the score.

869
01:38:09,044 --> 01:38:10,941
Not bad!

870
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,339
You really are a hotshot.

871
01:38:13,438 --> 01:38:16,534
I didn't expect you to get up.

872
01:38:17,234 --> 01:38:21,628
Your 18 men are lying there.

873
01:38:22,228 --> 01:38:27,022
You'll have company Song!

874
01:38:27,322 --> 01:38:32,216
When I get back to Shanghai
I'll say that Fat Yu killed you.

875
01:38:32,815 --> 01:38:34,814
I'll wear mourning for you...

876
01:38:34,913 --> 01:38:39,308
to show all of Shanghai
how much I value my men.

877
01:38:39,908 --> 01:38:44,102
Zheng and I will kill Fat Yu
to avenge you.

878
01:38:44,302 --> 01:38:47,099
Shanghai is going to see some action!

879
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:49,796
Too bad you won't be around to watch.

880
01:38:50,495 --> 01:38:54,790
Have you got a final wish?

881
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:57,386
I'll grant it for you.

882
01:38:58,385 --> 01:39:00,384
I've said all I had to say.

883
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:02,480
I wasn't going to speak again...

884
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:05,777
but as you're in such a good mood...

885
01:39:05,877 --> 01:39:09,173
I'll say one more thing
to please you.

886
01:39:09,573 --> 01:39:11,769
You forgot one thing.

887
01:39:12,269 --> 01:39:16,065
Maybe you had me followed...

888
01:39:16,564 --> 01:39:20,560
but I could easily
have done the same to you.

889
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:44,731
What do we do with him?

890
01:39:44,831 --> 01:39:47,028
Bury him alive.

891
01:40:29,478 --> 01:40:32,375
Since you had
a little act with Song...

892
01:40:32,475 --> 01:40:35,372
you're going to bow out with him.

893
01:40:35,472 --> 01:40:38,767
As they say you had it coming!

894
01:40:40,266 --> 01:40:44,561
I'm not going to publicize
your dirty little tricks.

895
01:40:45,260 --> 01:40:47,657
I'm not going to lose face.

896
01:40:47,757 --> 01:40:50,154
Nobodywill ever know.

897
01:40:50,254 --> 01:40:53,850
You will die as white as a lily.

898
01:40:55,148 --> 01:41:00,242
According to the rules
I will ask you one last question:

899
01:41:00,342 --> 01:41:02,040
Have you anything to say?

900
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:05,436
Have you got a final wish?

901
01:41:07,333 --> 01:41:11,429
You know I never asked you
for anything before.

902
01:41:11,629 --> 01:41:13,626
Now I ask for just one thing.

903
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:15,524
All right. Say it.

904
01:41:16,623 --> 01:41:20,519
Cuihua and Ajiao were not involved
in any of this.

905
01:41:20,818 --> 01:41:21,916
Don't touch them.

906
01:41:22,416 --> 01:41:25,013
Obviously I'm taking Ajiao with me.

907
01:41:25,113 --> 01:41:27,210
We'll take care of her.

908
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:31,306
In a few years
she'll be a new Bijou.

909
01:41:33,003 --> 01:41:35,601
But as for Cuihua...

910
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,498
it's too late.

911
01:41:38,997 --> 01:41:41,294
I didn't want to kill her...

912
01:41:41,394 --> 01:41:46,089
but since you talked to her
she knew too much.

913
01:41:46,288 --> 01:41:48,585
See? Your fault again.

914
01:41:52,181 --> 01:41:55,178
But that night...

915
01:41:55,378 --> 01:41:57,974
I told her nothing.

916
01:41:58,873 --> 01:42:01,171
I talked about myself...

917
01:42:01,271 --> 01:42:04,367
about my background.

918
01:42:09,061 --> 01:42:11,259
Cuihua...

919
01:42:12,257 --> 01:42:14,355
forgive me.

920
01:42:14,655 --> 01:42:16,952
Please forgive me.

921
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:20,348
- I shouldn't have come.
- What was that?

922
01:42:26,341 --> 01:42:28,238
I said...

923
01:42:29,138 --> 01:42:31,335
you're a pig!

924
01:42:32,135 --> 01:42:34,132
An old pig! I'll kill you!

925
01:42:39,226 --> 01:42:41,024
I'll kill you!

926
01:42:48,315 --> 01:42:50,313
Miss!

927
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:54,237
Come the spring...

928
01:43:54,437 --> 01:43:58,732
the grass on that island
will be good.

929
01:43:59,931 --> 01:44:02,328
You're right Boss.

930
01:44:05,424 --> 01:44:10,019
Grandpa you have to let
Shuisheng down!

931
01:44:10,119 --> 01:44:15,013
Later. It's not hurting him.
Don't worry.

932
01:44:15,712 --> 01:44:19,707
Ajiao did you never have a dog?

933
01:44:19,807 --> 01:44:20,806
No.

934
01:44:20,906 --> 01:44:23,703
A good dog has to be trained.

935
01:44:23,802 --> 01:44:26,800
That's what I'm doing to him.

936
01:44:28,797 --> 01:44:31,394
Where's Mommy? And Miss?

937
01:44:31,594 --> 01:44:33,591
Didn't you say...

938
01:44:33,691 --> 01:44:37,887
we would meet them
on the boat?

939
01:44:38,185 --> 01:44:43,080
They went away on another boat.

940
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:46,876
We'll meet up with them
in Shanghai.

941
01:44:46,976 --> 01:44:49,073
Am I going to Shanghai?

942
01:44:49,173 --> 01:44:52,769
Yes we're on our way to Shanghai.

943
01:44:52,869 --> 01:44:55,765
In Shanghai
will I have pretty dresses?

944
01:44:55,865 --> 01:44:56,864
Yes.

945
01:44:56,964 --> 01:44:58,961
And lots of nice things?

946
01:44:59,061 --> 01:45:00,260
Sure!

947
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:03,057
Lots of bracelets and rings.

948
01:45:04,555 --> 01:45:08,051
I want to be like Miss.

949
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:12,046
All right. You'll be like Miss.

950
01:45:12,546 --> 01:45:15,142
You'll be like Miss.

951
01:45:27,428 --> 01:45:31,124
Beddy-bye beddy-bye
Over Grandma's bridge

952
01:45:31,523 --> 01:45:36,617
Grandma says I'm good as gold
I know how to laugh

953
01:45:36,917 --> 01:45:39,513
I know how to cry

954
01:45:39,613 --> 01:45:43,608
Two yellow dogs carry the litter
