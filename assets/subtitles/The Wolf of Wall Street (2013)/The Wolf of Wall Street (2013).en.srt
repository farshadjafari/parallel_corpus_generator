<i>The world of investing...</i>

3
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,029
<i>..can be a jungle.</i>

4
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:50,673
<i>Bulls. Bears.</i>

5
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:52,665
<i>Danger at every turn.</i>

6
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:58,082
<i>That's why, we at Stratton Oakmont
pride ourselves, on being the best.</i>

7
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,503
<i>Trained professionals, to guide you

8
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:05,052
<i>Stratton Oakmont.</i>

00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:06,948
<i>Stabilty.</i>

10
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:09,085
<i>Integrity.</i>

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,978
<i>Pride.</i>

12
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,478
One.

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,462
Two..Three!

14
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:27,426
Twenty five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bullseye!

15
00:01:27,626 --> 00:01:30,120
Come on, let's go!

16
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,603
One.

17
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:34,490
Two..

18
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:37,875
...Three! My name
is Jordan Belfort.

19
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:42,024
Not him, Me. That's right.

20
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:43,829
I'm a former member
of the middle class,

21
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:48,170
raised by two accountants in a
tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.

22
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:50,848
The year I turned 26, as the
head of my own brokerage firm,

23
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:54,358
I made 49 million dollars.

24
00:01:54,557 --> 00:01:57,813
Which really pissed me off because it
was three shy of a million a week.

25
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:06,194
No..no..no, my Ferrari was white.
Like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.

26
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:08,467
Not red.

27
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:13,342
See that, humongous
estate down there?

28
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:15,503
That's my house.

29
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:20,733
My wife, Naomi. The Duchess
of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

30
00:02:21,447 --> 00:02:23,131
A former model and
Miller Lite girl.

31
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:28,144
Yeah, she was the one with my
cock in her mouth in the Ferrari,

32
00:02:28,473 --> 00:02:30,356
So, put your dick
back in your pants.

33
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:33,305
In addition to Naomi and
my two perfect kids,

34
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:36,841
I own a mansion, private
jet, six cars, three horses,

35
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:41,210
two vacation homes and
a 170 foot yacht.

36
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:50,790
I also gamble like a
degenerate, drink like a fish,

37
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,401
I fuck hookers maybe
five-six times a week,

38
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:57,366
I have three different Federal agencies
looking to indict me. Oh yeah..

39
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:00,717
...and I love drugs.

40
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,555
Pull up..Pull up!

41
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:25,002
We're gonna crash! For
Christ's sake! Pull up!

42
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:27,969
Juuusss..Relax.

43
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:41,066
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

44
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:42,265
Good job.

45
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:44,682
You get in there safe, alright?

46
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:47,441
Next time, brahther.

47
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Till next time.

48
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:58,108
Yep, on a daily basis I
consume enough drugs,

49
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:00,903
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island...

50
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:02,104
...and Queens.

51
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:05,186
- For a month.
- Okay, Mr. Jordan.

52
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:09,272
I take Quaaludes, ten to fifteen
times a day. For my back pain.

53
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:10,473
Adderall to stay focus.

54
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:14,490
Xanax to take the edge
off, pot to mellow out,

55
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,985
cocaine to wake back up
again and morphine well..

56
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:20,487
Because it's awesome.
Mornin' Blake.

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,072
But of all the drugs
under God's blue heaven,

58
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:32,093
there's one that's my
absolute favorite.

59
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,810
See...

60
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,225
enough of this shit'll
make you invincible,

61
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:42,891
able to conquer the world and
eviscerate your enemies.

62
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:46,999
And, I'm not talking about this.

63
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:50,106
I'm talking about <i>this</i>.

64
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:55,074
See, Money doesn't just
buy you a better life...

65
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,538
better food, better
cars, better pussy...

66
00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,985
it also makes you
a better person.

67
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,536
<i>You can give generously to the church
or political party of your choice.</i>

68
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:06,922
<i>You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.</i>

69
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:12,716
I've always wanted to be rich.

70
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,369
<i>So, let me go back.</i>

71
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:19,235
I'm 22 years old. Newly married and
already a money crazed little shit.

72
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:20,356
So, what do I do?

73
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:24,752
I go to the one place on Earth that
befit my high minded ambitions.

74
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,997
Jerry FOGEL: You are
lower than pond scum.

75
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:43,507
You got a problem with that?

76
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:45,792
Jordan?

77
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:46,992
No.

78
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:50,091
- No problem at all. - Good,
because that is what you are.

79
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,747
Pond scum. Your job is
'connector', which means...

80
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:56,643
that you'll be dialing the
phone over 500 times a day,

81
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,074
trying to 'connect' me with
wealthy business owners.

82
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:03,240
And, till you pass your Series 7, that
is all you're gonna fucking be doing.

83
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:05,550
Sit. Sit!

84
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:10,202
Just so you know, last year I
made over 300 thousand dollars.

85
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,358
The other guy you'll be working
for, he made over a million.

86
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:14,559
A million dollars?

87
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,884
I could only imagine what a
douchebag that guy must be.

88
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,096
- Jordan Belfort?
- Yes, Sir.

89
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,125
- Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

90
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:25,887
And, you as well. I see, you've
already met the village asshole.

91
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,331
Smile and dial.

92
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:30,119
And don't pick your
fucking head up till one.

93
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,319
Hey, fuck him.

94
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:34,096
I'm senior broker here, he's
just a worthless piker.

95
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,495
Why don't you blow me, Hannah.

96
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,177
Now, Did you really
pitched stock..

97
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:39,377
In your job interview?

98
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:41,524
I had to do something to
stand out. Right, Sir.

99
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:44,047
I fuckin' love that!

100
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:46,656
- Lunch, today.
- Yeah.

101
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:49,886
We don't start dialing
at 9:30 Because,

102
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:52,242
our clients are already
answering the phone!

103
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:53,442
Three, two..

104
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:56,284
One..Let's fuck!

105
00:06:57,942 --> 00:06:59,593
You want to know what
money sounds like?

106
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:01,923
Go to a trading floor
on Wall Street.

107
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:04,564
Fuck this, shit that.
Cunt, cock, asshole.

108
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:07,665
I couldn't believe how these
guys talked to each other.

109
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,548
I was hooked within seconds.

110
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,595
It was like mainlining
adrenaline.

111
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,920
- Fourty, Pick up the
cocksuckin' phone! - Sorry..

112
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:27,356
- You're such a fuckin' deouchbag,
Hanna. - We don't give two shits about..

113
00:07:27,497 --> 00:07:28,497
How' technology works.

114
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:31,040
Because, all we care about
is getting fuckin' rich!

115
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,252
- Jordan Belfort..
- Solid..two thousand.

116
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:37,802
Done! Time to paint the tape.

117
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:42,432
Whooow! Two thousand, Microsoft.
Going in the hole!

118
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:43,632
C'mon.

119
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:47,720
The pole man is alive. Alive.
Hold on to that, it's hot.

120
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:51,894
Shut that motherfucker.
Shut it..shut it. Shut it!

121
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:53,093
Sold!

122
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:21,598
Tootski?

123
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:22,798
No. Thank you, though.

124
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:26,161
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for
you on this glorious afternoon?

125
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:28,519
Well, Hector, here's
the game plan.

126
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:32,913
You're gonna nring us two Absolut Martinis,
You know how I like 'em, straight up.

127
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,511
And then, Precisely seven and
one half minutes after that,

128
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:37,559
You're gonna nring us
two more, and then..

129
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,869
Two more after that every five minutes,
until one of us passes the fuck out.

130
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:45,149
An excellent strategy, Sir?

131
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,052
I'm good with water for
now, though thank you.

132
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:51,203
It's his first day on Wall
Street, Give him time.

133
00:08:51,403 --> 00:08:53,725
- Thank you.
- Mmhmm.

134
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,062
Mr. Hanna..

135
00:08:57,261 --> 00:08:58,261
You're able to..

136
00:08:58,461 --> 00:09:02,393
...do drugs during the day and
still function and do your job?

137
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,437
How the fuck else would
you do this job?

138
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:06,573
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

139
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:07,774
Right.

140
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:12,758
I gotta say, I'm incredibly excited
about being part of your firm.

141
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:17,923
- The clients you have are
absolutely.. - Fuck the clients.

142
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:21,411
Your only responsibility is
to put mean on the table.

143
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:24,854
- You got a girlfriend?
- I am married.

144
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:27,583
My wife, her name is Teresa.
She cuts hair.

145
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,982
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

146
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:29,984
Think about Teresa.

147
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:33,850
Name of the game? Move the money
from your client's pocket.

148
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,277
- Into your pocket.
- Right.

149
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,717
But, if you can make the clients
money, at the same time.

150
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:41,075
It advantageous to everyone.
Correct?

151
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:42,274
No.

152
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:45,861
Number one rule of Wall Street.

153
00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:47,062
Nobody...

154
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:50,350
okay, if you're Warren
Buffet or Jimmy Buffet.

155
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:54,894
Nobody knows, if a stock's gonna go up,
down, sideways or fucking circles.

156
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,176
Least of all stock brokers.

157
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:59,357
It's all a Fughazi. You
know what a fughazi is?

158
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,746
<i>Fugazi</i> it's a fake..

159
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:04,546
Yeah, <i>Fugazi,</i> Fughazi. It's
a wazi, it's a woozi...

160
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:08,326
...fairy dust. It doesn't exist.
It never landed.

161
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,706
It is no matter. It's not
in the elemental chart.

162
00:10:10,905 --> 00:10:12,711
It's not fucking real!

163
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:15,914
- Stay with me.
- Mmhmm.

164
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,264
We don't create shit. We
don't build anything.

165
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:22,826
So, you got a client. Who
bought stock at eight.

166
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:24,066
And, announces it sixteen.

167
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:27,015
He's all fucking happy, He
wants to cash in, liquidate.

168
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:30,385
Take his fucking money and run
home. You don't let him do that.

169
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,889
- Cos, that would make it real.
- Right.

170
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,090
What do you do?

171
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:37,533
You get another brilliant idea.
A special Idea.

172
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:40,024
Another situation.
Another stock.

173
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,433
To reinvest his earnings
and then, some.

174
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:46,088
And, he will. Every single time.
Cos, they're fuckin' addicted.

175
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:47,874
And, then..you just
keep doing this.

176
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:49,846
Again and again. ..and again.

177
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:51,047
Meanwhile..

178
00:10:51,246 --> 00:10:54,428
He thinks, he is gettin' shit
rich. Which he is... On paper.

179
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,827
But, you and me. The brokers..

180
00:10:55,828 --> 00:11:00,703
We are taking home cold hard cash
via. Commission, motherfucker!

181
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:01,903
Right.

182
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:05,865
That's incredible Sir.

183
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,184
- I can't tell you, how excited
I am. - You should be.

184
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:09,345
There's two keys,

185
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,490
to sucess, in the
broker business.

186
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,690
First of all,

187
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:17,787
You gotta stay relax.

188
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:18,986
You jerk off?

189
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:25,115
Do I jerk off? Yeah,
Yeah, I jerk off..yeah.

190
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:26,315
How many times a week?

191
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:30,366
Like, uhm..three
four times, maybe.

192
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,427
Pump those numbers up. Those are
rookies number in this racket.

193
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,427
I myself, I jerk off at least..

194
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:38,846
- Twice a day.
- Wow!

195
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:40,767
Once in the morning,
right after I work out.

196
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:42,855
- And, then once, right
after lunch. - Really?

197
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,163
I want to. That's
not why I do it.

198
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:48,413
I do it, cos I fucking need to.

199
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:49,614
Think about it.

200
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:52,212
You're dealing with numbers.
All day long.

201
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:56,361
Decimal points..high frequencies.
Bang, bang bang. Iek, iek eik..

202
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:58,365
Fucking digits!
Ke, ke..ke ke..

203
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:00,360
All very acidic,
above the shoulders,

204
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,559
mustered shit.

205
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,759
Alright?

206
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,962
That kind can weaken
some people up. Right?

207
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:07,082
You gotta feed the geese.
Keep the blood flowing.

208
00:12:07,363 --> 00:12:09,284
And, keep the rhythm
below the belt.

209
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:10,485
Done.

210
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:12,851
This is not a tip. This is
a perscription. Trust me.

211
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:14,052
If you don't?

212
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:15,986
You will fall out of balance.

213
00:12:16,187 --> 00:12:18,227
Split the differential..
And tip the fuck over.

214
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:19,427
Or, worse shit.

215
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:21,480
I've seen this happen..
Implode.

216
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,547
- No, I don't wanna implode
Sir. - No, you don't.

217
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:25,746
I'm in it for the long run.
You know?

218
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:27,797
- Yeah, implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

219
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,004
Pop off to the bathroom,
work on it anytime you can.

220
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,163
And, when you get
really good at it.

221
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,933
You'll fucking be stroking it. And,
you'll be thinking about money.

222
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:38,432
Second..key to sucess.

223
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,985
In this racket, Is this baby
right here. It's called cocaine.

224
00:12:43,552 --> 00:12:45,466
It will keep you sharp,
between the ears.

225
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,628
It will also help your fingers
dial faster. And, guess what?

226
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:49,827
That's good for me.

227
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:53,561
Yes, Sir.

228
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,366
Revolutions. You follow?

229
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,548
- Revolutions. - Keep the
client on the Ferris wheel.

230
00:12:58,748 --> 00:13:01,783
And, it goes..the park is open.
24/7..365.

231
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:04,842
Every decade..every
goddamn century.

232
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:06,043
That's it.

233
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:08,667
The name of the game.

234
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,664
I'll key the key.

235
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:12,865
Thank you.

236
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,392
We are common denominator.

237
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,975
Keep that for me.

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,879
For the next six months I got to know
the 'ins' and 'out' of Wall Street.

239
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:04,833
Earning shit money, as I geare
up to take my Series 7.

240
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:21,903
Then, I was a license
broker at last.

241
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:24,453
Ready to make my fortune.

242
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:28,869
My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.

243
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,527
They called it <i>Black Monday</i>.

244
00:14:49,342 --> 00:14:50,457
No shit.

245
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:55,015
By four P.M. the market
had dropped 508 points,

246
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:58,174
the biggest plummet,
since the crash of '29.

247
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,097
This is not something,
that you wanna sell.

248
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:08,298
You know what happened?
A fucking Tsunami.

249
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:09,498
I think you're making
a big mistake.

250
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:13,133
- Yes, I will talk to your wife. -
Trust me. Do not answer the phone.

251
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:16,923
A lot of people are gonna be calling you.
Trying you to get your dirty laundry.

252
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,352
Holy.

253
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:34,605
Fucking..Shit!

254
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,706
Unbelievable!

255
00:15:37,907 --> 00:15:39,774
My first shitty day as a broker.

256
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:40,975
Within a month,

257
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:45,173
L.F. Rothschild, an
institution since 1899,

258
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:46,716
...closed its doors.

259
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,243
Wall street had swallowed me up.

260
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:52,471
And, shit me right
back out again.

261
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,591
We could pawn my engagement
ring. If we needed to.

262
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,790
Cos, I don't mind.

263
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,600
- If we needed to, I'm saying I'm
okay. - Will you listen to me.

264
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,455
We're not pawning anything.
Okay?

265
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:07,072
- What'd I always tell you?
- You're gonna be a millionaire.

266
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:08,072
That's right, okay?

267
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:11,075
Let me look.. We'll
find something.

268
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:12,274
- How about this?
- What?

269
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:15,248
- Nobody Beats the Wiz”.
- Electronic store.

270
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,870
- Stock boy, what do you think? -
You're not gonna work at that place.

271
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,187
- Yeah, but you know..you start off..
- Jordan you're gonna be miserable..

272
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:23,129
- At that place, if you go there. -
It's sales. You work your way up..

273
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,836
- You'd be a general manger.. -
You're not gonna be a stock boy.

274
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:27,264
- Why not?
- Cos, you're a stock broker.

275
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:30,030
You understand that, nobody is
hiring stock brokers right now.

276
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,770
You understand that? Okay?

277
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,161
Ah, this place is..

278
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,629
- What does that say?
- Stock brokers.

00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:48,004
Long Island. Stock
brokers in Long Island.

- Pink sheets?
- Yeah, they're Penny stocks.

They are out of Dubuque. Maybe, it's
microwaves, I'm not sure. But..

00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,307
You call the

Six cents a share? C'mon,

00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:31,852
Well, I mean..

Honestly, mostly Schmucks.

There's postmen, there's
always a postman.

307
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:37,150
Plumbers, uhm...?

00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,183
Jordan, what did you get

00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:18,653
It's fifty percent?

327
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:23,999
It's fifty percent commission?

328
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yup.

329
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
For what?

330
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,832
It's our Mark up
for our services.

331
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:33,324
So, if I..if I sell a stock
at ten thousand dollars.

00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:35,559
My commission is
five thousand bucks?

333
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,030
If you sell ten thousand
dollars worth of this stock,

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,547
I'll personally give you
a blowjob for free.

00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:44,480
And, I hope it happens.

336
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:47,519
Hello, John. How're
you doing today?

Penny stocks that had huge..

339
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:56,309
Upside potential with very
little downside risk.

340
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:58,076
- Does that ring a bell?
<i>- Oh, yeah. I may've sent you.</i>

341
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:00,798
Okay great. Well, the reason
for the call today John is.

342
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:04,236
Something just came
across my desk John.

343
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:07,192
It is perhaps the best, I've
seen in the last six months.

344
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:08,392
If you've sixty seconds,

345
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:10,551
I'd like to share this with you.
You got a minute?

346
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:13,906
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International..

347
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:17,105
It is a cutting edge tech
firm out of the Midwest,

348
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:19,586
awaiting imminent
patent approval,

349
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:23,483
on a new generation of radar detectors
that have both huge military,

350
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:25,424
and civilian applications.

351
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,625
Now.

352
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:30,347
Right now John. The stock trades over
the counter at ten cents a share,

353
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:31,548
And, by the way John...

354
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:34,904
Our analyst indicates, it could go
a heck of a lot higher after that.

355
00:20:35,105 --> 00:20:36,105
Your profit,

356
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:39,080
on a mere six thousand dollar
investment would be, upwards of..

357
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,965
...sixty thousand dollars!

358
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:44,750
- Jesus! That's my morgage man! -
Exactly, you could pay off your morgage.

359
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,748
John, one thing I
can promise you.

360
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:48,948
Even in this market,

361
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,413
Is that I never ask my clients
to judge me on my winners.

362
00:20:52,614 --> 00:20:56,153
I ask them to judge me on my losers.
Because, they I have so few.

363
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:57,473
And in the case of Aerotyne,

364
00:20:57,552 --> 00:21:00,887
Based on every technical
factor out there, John.

365
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:03,978
We are looking at a
Grand Slam home run.

366
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:09,191
<i>I'll do four grand.</i> Four thousand,
that'd be 40 thousand shares, John.

367
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:10,391
Let me lock in on
that trade now,

368
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,585
and get back to you with my secretary
with an exact confirmation.

369
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:15,605
- Sound good, John?
- That sounds good. Great.

370
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:16,606
Hey, John?

371
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:18,326
Thank you for your
vote of confidence.

372
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,788
- And, Welcome to the Investors
Center. <i>- Yeah, thanks a lot. Bye.</i>

373
00:21:26,614 --> 00:21:28,215
How'd you fuckin' do that?

374
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:32,375
Just like that I made two grand.

375
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:35,119
The other guys looked at me
like, I'd just discovered fire.

376
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:38,569
Great! Even better!

377
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:40,250
I was selling garbage
to garbage men.

378
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,789
And, making cash
hand over fist.

379
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:44,952
The only problem you're gonna have
is, that you didn't buy more.

380
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:46,250
Boom..Shakalak!

381
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,210
So, I was selling them shit.

382
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,052
The way I look at it,

383
00:21:50,252 --> 00:21:52,201
Their money was better
off in my apartment.

384
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:54,569
I knew how to spend it better.

385
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:55,705
Excuse me.

386
00:21:55,905 --> 00:21:57,066
Is that your car, in the lot?

387
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,250
Yeah.

388
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,386
- That's a nice ride.
- Thanks man.

389
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:01,586
Donnie Azoff.

390
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:03,650
Jordan Belfort.
Nice to meet you.

391
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:07,284
You know, I've seen it around.
I've seen it around a lot.

392
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:10,585
- I think, we live in the
same building. - No, shit?

393
00:22:10,785 --> 00:22:13,147
- Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

394
00:22:13,347 --> 00:22:16,173
Fourth floor. I have a four
year old kid, ugly wife?

395
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:18,569
So, what do you do, bro?

396
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,739
What do you mean, what do I do?

397
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:22,939
For work? What do you do?

398
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:24,138
I'm a Stock broker.

399
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:26,292
- Stock broker?
- Yeah.

400
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:27,492
Childrens Furniture.

401
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,950
Oh, good for you.

402
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,150
It's all right.

403
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,423
You make a lot of money?

404
00:22:34,026 --> 00:22:35,561
Yeah, I do alright for myself.

405
00:22:35,761 --> 00:22:36,761
I'm trying..to put it together.

406
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:39,932
Your fucking nice car? We
live in the same building?

407
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:41,133
I'm not understanding...

408
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:42,371
How much money do you make?

409
00:22:44,511 --> 00:22:46,626
I don't know. Seventy
Thousand last month.

410
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:47,826
Get the fuck...!

411
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,309
Get the fuck out of here.

412
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:51,509
I'm serious.

413
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,710
No, I'm serious too.

414
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,636
Seriously, how much
money do you make?

415
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:57,037
I told you, 70 thousand.

416
00:22:57,237 --> 00:23:00,855
Well, technically. 72
thousand last month.

417
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:02,055
Somethin like that.

418
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:06,118
- You make 72 grand a month?
- Yeah.

419
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,329
Tell you what.

420
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:15,540
You show me a pay stub
with $72,000 on it,

421
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,877
I'll quit my job right now
and I'll work for you.

422
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,692
Hey, Paulie. What's up?

423
00:23:26,893 --> 00:23:28,013
No, yeah..everything's fine.

424
00:23:28,093 --> 00:23:29,869
Hey, listen. I quit.

425
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:31,119
And he did quit his job,

426
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,546
which I thought was a little weird. I
mean, I had just met this fucking guy.

427
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,625
There were other
things about him too,

428
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,579
like his phosphorescent
white teeth;

429
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:45,868
And the fact that he wore horn rims
with clear lenses to look more Waspy.

430
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:48,869
Then, there were this..rumours.

431
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:51,890
I heard this, stupid shit.
I don't know.

432
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:53,089
I didn't even wanna bring it up.

433
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:56,291
- It's just... stupid.
- Is it about me?

434
00:23:56,491 --> 00:23:57,531
You know, people say shit.

435
00:23:57,692 --> 00:24:00,319
I don't even listen to
them, half of the time.

436
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:03,047
What do they say?

437
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:06,663
Shit, about you doing your
cousin or something like that?

438
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:07,903
I don't even listen to it.

439
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:09,064
Bro, it's not like that.

440
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:10,384
You know, it's not like that.

441
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:14,117
I mean, like you married your
cousin. Some stupid shit.

442
00:24:15,637 --> 00:24:18,029
Yeah, my wife..yeah,
my wife is my cousin.

443
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,922
It's not like what you
think, whatever..you know?

444
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:23,397
Is she like a... first cousin?
Or is she...

445
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:29,329
Her..her father, is the
brother of my Mom.

446
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:31,730
It's not like... We
grew up together.

447
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,261
And, she grew up hot..you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

448
00:24:35,461 --> 00:24:36,461
All my friends were trying
to fuck her. You know?

449
00:24:36,662 --> 00:24:38,624
I'm not gonna let someone...

450
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:42,451
One of these assholes fuck my cousin.
So, I used the cousin thing as...

451
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:46,698
I'm not gonna let, someone
else fuck my cousin.

452
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:49,314
If any one is gonna fuck my
cousin, it's gonna be me.

453
00:24:49,513 --> 00:24:51,207
- Out of respect. You know..
- No..I get it. Yeah..

454
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,867
You're not afraid of like
the whole kid thing, right?

455
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:55,107
What? Having kid with her?

456
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:56,468
- Yeah.
- No, we have two kids.

457
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,470
I don't mean.. I don't
wanna get personal..

458
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:00,544
They're okay?

459
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:02,718
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

460
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:04,157
But, there'a big chance, right?

461
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:06,480
Yeah... There is like a..
Sixty percent..

462
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,451
You know, sixty sixty-five percent chance
the kid's gonna be fucking retarded..

463
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:11,651
- ..Or whatever. - That scares
the shit out of me, buddy.

464
00:25:11,851 --> 00:25:14,144
Look, man. A lot happen
with kids. Whatever takes

465
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:16,436
biz whether you're
fucking cousin or not..

466
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:18,688
What if something
like that happened?

467
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,960
I basically, you know?
If the kid is retarted.

468
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,548
I would drive it
up to the country,

469
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:26,746
and just like, open the door and
I'm gonna set you free now.

470
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:29,333
You know, like run free..
You know..

471
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,567
I'm completely fucking with you!

472
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,237
That's horrible...

473
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:45,093
No. We would take it to institution or
something where it's handled like..

474
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:46,374
Raise the kid or whatever..

475
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:49,689
You know what? If you're
happy, God bless you, buddy.

476
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:50,730
No, I'm not fucking happy.

477
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,743
No one who's married
is fucking happy.

478
00:25:52,943 --> 00:25:54,703
Well, I'm sorry to
hear that, buddy.

479
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:55,903
Listen, I'm really..

480
00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:59,378
I'm really appreciative
of this fucking job.

481
00:25:59,578 --> 00:26:02,316
- I'm really enjoying.. - I'm
really happy of what you're doing..

482
00:26:02,516 --> 00:26:04,280
Actually, I got you
a little present.

483
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,520
- You got me a present?
- I got you something, yeah.

484
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:08,692
- You're sweet!
- It's in the back though.

485
00:26:10,326 --> 00:26:11,613
We gotta go out back.

486
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:13,486
What, it's wrapped
up or something?

487
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:14,685
It's wrapped up yeah.

488
00:26:14,885 --> 00:26:15,885
I don't get it.

489
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:18,092
We can do it while you're
in fucking car. Come on.

490
00:26:20,217 --> 00:26:22,601
I'm not fucking doing this.
You're out of your fucking mind.

491
00:26:22,602 --> 00:26:24,328
Do this shit bro. No.

492
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:25,609
No one is fucking here bro.

493
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:28,194
Get the fuck in.

494
00:26:28,394 --> 00:26:30,038
Smoke this crack with me bro.

495
00:26:31,984 --> 00:26:33,711
Smoke some fucking
crack with me bro.

496
00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:36,318
One hit. That's it.

497
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:12,553
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

498
00:27:12,752 --> 00:27:15,406
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

499
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:18,772
Let's run like a fucking
lion and tirger in pairs!

500
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,436
Let's fucking run!
Let's fucking run!

501
00:27:23,636 --> 00:27:25,631
Go..go... go..go!

502
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,703
<i>You've reached
Frank's auto body.</i>

My partner and I are..

507
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:37,427
Very interested in
renting out your garage.

508
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,830
Donnie and I were
going out on our own.

509
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,558
And, the first thing
we needed was brokers.

510
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,451
Guys with sales experience.

511
00:27:44,652 --> 00:27:46,736
So, I recruited some
of my home town boys.

512
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:49,866
Sea Otter. Who sole
meat and weed.

513
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:53,124
Chester..who sold
tyres and weed.

514
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:54,324
And, Robbie...

515
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:56,281
who sold anything he
could get his hands on.

516
00:27:56,481 --> 00:27:57,481
Mostly, weed.

517
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,513
This is Brad.

518
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,490
And, Brad's the guy
I really wanted.

519
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,669
But, he didn't go along with us.

520
00:28:04,868 --> 00:28:07,432
He was already making so
much money selling Qualutes.

521
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:10,078
He'd become the Quaalude
King of Bayside.

522
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,539
You get any pussy with
that thing or what?

523
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,241
Yeah, man. Of course man. - Bring
some chicks around here sometime huh.

524
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,795
Little morch... little morch.

525
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:19,183
Hey, Zit.

526
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:21,732
Tell your sister, I
was asking about her.

527
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:24,574
But you bring me a pair of her
panties, next time you come through.

528
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:27,546
Yeah, man. She said, they
don't wanna talk to you man.

529
00:28:27,746 --> 00:28:29,844
Get the fuck out of here.

530
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:32,304
Hey, Ma. We got
chicken or what?

531
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,394
Ma?!

532
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:37,326
You listening? It's
easier than you think.

533
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:38,527
Every person you're
on the phone with,

534
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:41,532
They wanna get rich and they
wanna get rich quickly.

535
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:43,486
- They all want something for
nothing. - There was this one time,

536
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:46,726
That I was selling pot to Amish dude.
You know guy's that got like the beard,

537
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,539
- With like no mustache or
some bullshit.. - Yeah..yeah.

538
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,224
Well, he says that he only
wants to make furniture.

539
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:55,453
- What's that gotta do with
anything? - I don't understand.

540
00:28:55,454 --> 00:28:57,434
What the fuck are
you talking about?

541
00:28:57,634 --> 00:28:59,538
I'm not putting words into
your mouth or nothing, But..

542
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:02,513
You just said that, Everybody
wants to get rich.

543
00:29:02,713 --> 00:29:05,034
- Holy fuck, you did just said
that. - Yeah, you said that.

544
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:08,762
- What the fuck are you talking
about? - Yeah, like Buddhist.

545
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:10,888
They don't give a shit about
money. They're wrapped in sheets!

546
00:29:11,088 --> 00:29:12,088
- They don't buy shits. - I'm
not..i'm..I'm not talking..

547
00:29:12,288 --> 00:29:13,369
...about Buddhist or Amish.

548
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:15,224
I'm talking about normal people.

549
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:17,744
Working class, everyday people.
Everyone wants to get rich.

550
00:29:17,935 --> 00:29:20,182
- Am I crazy? - There's no
such thing as Amish Buddhist..

551
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:21,903
- I am pretty fucking sure.
- No, I didn't..

552
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:24,557
- Can we get some Ketchup please?
- I didn't say Amish Buddhist..

553
00:29:24,557 --> 00:29:25,928
Do you guys not
wanna make money?

554
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:29,189
I wanna make some
fucking money, okay?

555
00:29:29,324 --> 00:29:30,324
I can sell anything.

556
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:32,223
Shit, I can sell lubes
to convent full of

557
00:29:32,224 --> 00:29:33,923
Nuns getting horny to
be fuckin' each other.

558
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:36,353
That's the attitude!
You can sell anything?

559
00:29:36,552 --> 00:29:38,313
Sell me, this fucking
pen right here.

560
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:39,512
You can sell anything..
Sell that.

561
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,712
Sell me that pen?

562
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,688
Can I finish eating first?
I hadn't eaten today.

563
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,835
Brad, show 'em how it's done.

564
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:47,806
Boom. Sell me that pen.
Watch, go on.

565
00:29:48,006 --> 00:29:49,006
You want me to sell
this fucking pen?

566
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,246
That's my boy right there.

567
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:52,028
Fucking sell anything.

568
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:54,515
Why don't you do me a favour? Write
your name down on that napkin for me?

569
00:29:54,714 --> 00:29:55,714
I don't have a pen.

570
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:57,905
Exactly. Supply and
demand, my friend.

571
00:29:58,105 --> 00:30:00,003
See what I mean? He's
creating urgency.

572
00:30:00,203 --> 00:30:03,193
Getting you to want to buy this stock.
Gotta make it as something that they need.

573
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,480
That's the thing.

574
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,351
All nuns are lesbians.

575
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,856
What the fuck are you
talking about, Otter?

576
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,936
Yeah, think about it. They
can't keep in dudes..

577
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:13,769
Four fucking times.
Get me four times.

578
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:19,402
Look, I knew these guys
weren't like Harvard MBAs.

579
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,394
Robbie Feinberg the pin head, took
five years to finish High School.

580
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,510
Alden Kupferberg-The sea
otter, Didn't even graduate.

581
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:30,971
Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman
thought Jiujitsu was in Israel.

582
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,281
Smartest of the bunch
was Nicky Koskoff.

583
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:34,789
He actually went to Law School.

584
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,824
I call him "Rugrat" b'cos of
his piece of shit hairpiece.

585
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,359
Still, give me them
young, hungry and stupid.

586
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,011
And, in no time I'll
make them rich.

587
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:50,424
Omigod. Jordan.

588
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:51,625
You like it, baby?

589
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:54,682
It's beautiful.

590
00:30:54,882 --> 00:30:55,882
They're not the biggest
stones in the world.

591
00:30:56,082 --> 00:30:58,650
But, I promise they are
really high quality.

592
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:01,446
This is beautiful. I don't...
it's so beautiful.

593
00:31:02,713 --> 00:31:04,584
- Oh, boy.
- What?

594
00:31:04,784 --> 00:31:05,784
I know that look.

595
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:08,830
- What is it? Go ahead.
- I don't know, it's..

596
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:14,201
These stocks, these companies.
They are like, crappy companies?

597
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:16,933
Yeah, Yeah. They are terrible.

598
00:31:18,347 --> 00:31:21,133
Don't worry about it. I told you,
What I'm doing is, completely legal.

599
00:31:21,134 --> 00:31:24,094
Yeah, I know. They're like, they're not
gonna make any money though, right?

600
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:27,125
Sometimes they do.
Sometimes, they don't.

601
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:28,325
You know, how it goes.

602
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:29,525
Wouldn't you feel better,

603
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:33,166
if you sold that stuffs to rich people, who
can like afford to lose a lot of money?

604
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:36,470
Of course.

605
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:39,410
But, rich people don't
buy Penny stocks.

606
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:40,609
They just don't.

607
00:31:42,082 --> 00:31:43,223
Why not?

608
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,115
Because they're too
smart, that's why not.

609
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,660
I mean, what person with
a college education.

610
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,185
Would trust this
bunch of jerk offs?

611
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,052
But what if they didn't sound
like a bunch of jerk offs?

612
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,079
What if, I can teach them how to
sell it to people with money?

613
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,150
<i>Real money.</i>

614
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:06,470
So, I decided to
re-invent the company.

615
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:12,288
Gentlemen, Welcome
to Stratton Oakmont.

616
00:32:12,488 --> 00:32:14,367
You snooks will now be
targeting the wealthiest.

617
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:17,266
One percent of Americans.

618
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:19,573
I'm talking about Whales, here.

619
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:20,772
Moby 'fucking' Dicks.

620
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:23,157
And, with this script.

621
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:25,269
Which is now your
new 'Harpoon'..

622
00:32:25,469 --> 00:32:28,982
I'm goona teach each and
everyone of you to be Captain...

623
00:32:29,182 --> 00:32:30,182
Fucking Ahab.

624
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:32,509
Get it? Huh?

625
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,710
Captain Who?

626
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,646
Captain Ahab. From
the fucking...

627
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:38,941
Book..motherfucker.
From the book.

628
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:40,181
Turn you fucking brain on!

629
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,799
Listen to me.

630
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,384
We are a new company,
with a new name.

631
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:48,394
A Company, that our
clients can believe in.

632
00:32:48,595 --> 00:32:51,481
A Company, that our
clients can trust.

633
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,240
A firm, whose roots..

634
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:56,319
Are so deeply embedded
into Wall Street,

635
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:57,519
That our very Founders,

636
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,145
Sailed over n the Mayflower,

637
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,746
chiselled the name
Stratton Oakmont,

638
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:03,720
right into plummet fucking rock.

639
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
Got it?

640
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,369
What we are gonna do is this.

641
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,469
First we pitch
them Disney, AT&T,

642
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:13,183
IBM, blue chips
stocks exclusively.

643
00:33:13,384 --> 00:33:15,374
Companies at these peoples moan.

644
00:33:15,574 --> 00:33:16,574
Once we sucker them in,

645
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:19,544
We unload the dog shits.

646
00:33:19,743 --> 00:33:21,811
The pink sheets, the
pennies stocks.

647
00:33:22,011 --> 00:33:23,011
Where we laid the money.

648
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,423
50% commission baby.

649
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:28,688
Now, the key to making money
in a situation like this,

650
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:31,609
Is to position yourself
now, before the settlement.

651
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,569
Because, by the time you read about
it in The Wall Street Journal.

652
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:37,153
It's already too late.

653
00:33:37,354 --> 00:33:38,442
And you wait.

654
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:39,643
You wait.

655
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:42,808
And, whoever speaks first..
loses.

656
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:47,584
<i>Sorry, I appreciate the call.</i>

657
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:50,114
<i>I realy have to give
this some thought.</i>

658
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:51,957
<i>And, uh..talking to
my wife about it.</i>

659
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,156
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

660
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:54,813
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it.

661
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:57,067
They gotta talk to the fucking
wives. Or the fucking tooth fairy..

662
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:59,146
The point is it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

663
00:33:59,346 --> 00:34:02,183
The only objection they have
is they don't trust you guys.

664
00:34:02,384 --> 00:34:04,479
And, why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you..

665
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,519
You're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salemen right?

666
00:34:07,575 --> 00:34:09,599
- So, what do you say?
- You mean to tell me that..

667
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,668
If I put you in Union Carbide
at 7 and took you out at 32..

668
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:16,297
Texas Instruments at 11
and took you out at 47..

669
00:34:16,496 --> 00:34:18,757
You're still at 16 and
took you out at 41,

670
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,157
...you wouldn't say Chester..

671
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:22,505
Pick me up a few thousand
shares at Disney?

672
00:34:22,706 --> 00:34:25,467
- On the spot, right now. C'mon. -
I mean, honestly Kevin. Honestly..

673
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:27,324
- Seriously?
- I don't know you.

674
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,742
You cold called me.
You're a total stranger..

675
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,079
I'm in complete agreement with you,
You don't know me, I don't know you..

676
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:36,300
- ..Alden Kupferberg.
- Robbie Feinberg.

677
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
- Chester Ming. - I'm Senior
Vice president at Stratton.

678
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,400
- ...Oakmont. - And I plan
on being one of the...

679
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:43,346
- Top broker in my firm next year.
- And, I'm not gonna get there,

680
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:45,387
- by being wrong, Stan.
- I do wanna say that..

681
00:34:47,023 --> 00:34:48,916
You sound like a
pretty sincere guy.

682
00:34:49,117 --> 00:34:51,398
It's not gonna make you rich.
It's not gonn make you poor.

683
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:53,644
But, what Stratton..will
do is serve as a...

684
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:57,369
- Benchmark, for future business, Kevin.
- You feel comfortable with me, Scott?

685
00:34:57,568 --> 00:34:58,809
And, then you'll know for sure,

686
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:02,443
That you've finally found the broker
on Wall Street that you can trust.

687
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:06,344
And who can consistently,
make you money.

688
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:07,543
Sound fair enough?

689
00:35:11,547 --> 00:35:14,315
<i>Yeah, I gotta say, I'm
pretty impressed.</i>

690
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:17,920
<i>What do..what do you think?</i>

691
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,119
Kevin?

692
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,623
You give me one shot here,

693
00:35:21,824 --> 00:35:23,945
On a blue chip stock like Kodak.

694
00:35:24,146 --> 00:35:26,112
And, believe me..Kevin.

695
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:28,927
The only problem
you gonna have..

696
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:31,360
Is that you didn't buy more.

697
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:33,523
Sound fair enough?

698
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:36,795
<i>Shit..</i>

699
00:35:39,992 --> 00:35:42,592
<i>My wife might devorce me.
But, yeah.. let's do it.</i>

700
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:47,364
Excellent choice, Kevin. How much
do you wanna go for it, this time?

701
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:49,722
Let's do five..five
thousand dollars.

702
00:35:49,922 --> 00:35:50,922
Why don't we try eight
thousand, Kevin?

703
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:52,123
All right, let's do ten.

704
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:53,362
- Ten?
- You wanna do that?

705
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:54,523
Excellent choice.

706
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:57,202
Kevin, let me lock in that trade
right now and get back to you,

707
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:58,869
in a few minutes. With
the exact confirmation.

708
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,202
Kevin, and Welcome..

709
00:36:00,402 --> 00:36:02,873
- ..To Stratton Oakmond. - Thanks
man, I'm gonna have a beer,

710
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:06,387
- This is fun.
- Take it easy Kevin.

711
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,599
Thanks Jordan. Thanks a lot.

712
00:36:16,103 --> 00:36:17,952
- What a fucking idiot.
- The one..

713
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:21,333
...thing I know about in
this world is Airlines.

714
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:25,032
And Kushon Airlines is
the future of Airlines.

715
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:26,898
- Get in now..
- My name is Nicky Koskoff.

716
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,668
Chester Ming, and I'm a Senior Vice
President at Stratton Oakmont.

717
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:34,864
Truly I'm so so sorry
for your loss.

718
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:37,809
- When did he passed?
- Just think I'm wrong..

719
00:36:42,605 --> 00:36:46,351
It's like getting in on sunlight before
there's any sunlight, you understand?

720
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:52,521
That was a very
intelligent decision I'm

721
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:54,407
happy to transfer you
to our sale associate.

722
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:56,454
Rhonda.

723
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:57,655
Rhonda?

724
00:36:57,855 --> 00:36:59,954
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

725
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:08,396
Everybody have a good week?

726
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,079
End of the month.

727
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,465
$28.7 million in
gross commissions,

728
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:18,019
All from Pink Sheets Stock Boys!

729
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,431
And to celebrate with a
weekly act of debauchery,

730
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:26,012
I have offered our lovely sales
assistant Danielle Harrison here,

731
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:27,211
ten thousand dollars..

732
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,206
To shave a fucking eye!

733
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,889
Yeah!

734
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,547
You want this? Huh?
You want this?!

735
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:41,623
Let the shaving begin!

736
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:43,409
Scalp, scalp... scalp.

737
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:45,909
Scalp, scalp... scalp..scalp,
scalp... scalp.

738
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:53,063
FYI Boys, Danielle's promised to use This
10 thousand dollars for breast implants!

739
00:37:53,264 --> 00:37:56,949
She's already got C-cups, But now
she wants fucking Double Ds!

740
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,509
Is this a great
company or what?!

741
00:38:02,503 --> 00:38:04,847
This is the greatest fucking
company of the world!

742
00:38:08,572 --> 00:38:09,405
Dominic..

743
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,550
Blow the roof off
this motherfucker!

744
00:39:39,989 --> 00:39:41,664
Word spread throughout
Wall Street.

745
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:44,920
Even in places I
didn't want it to.

746
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,340
It wasn't long before
Forbes Magazine.

747
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:00,811
The flagship of Wall Street
called to do a 'Profile' on me.

748
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:03,577
Let me ask you, How do you see
the future for Straten Oakland.

749
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:04,777
One word..

750
00:40:07,744 --> 00:40:08,786
Diversification.

751
00:40:08,985 --> 00:40:10,760
That's good. Thank
you so much.

752
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,960
- I have more than enough.
- Fantastic..fantastic.

753
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,240
Can we get a quick picture?

754
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,065
A total fucking hatchet job.

755
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:19,590
This conniving little twat!
Look at this?

756
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:22,764
The Wolf of Wall Street”.
They call me..look.

757
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:23,963
Your hair looks good.

758
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,690
<i>Jordan Belfort,</i>

759
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:29,666
<i>sounding like a kind
of twisted Robin Hood</i>

760
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:32,309
<i>who takes from the rich
and gives to himself</i>

761
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,474
<i>and his Merry
band of brokers”.</i>

762
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:35,875
- Read that..read it.
- Listen.

763
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:36,967
There's no such thing,

764
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,648
- as bad publicity, Sweeheart.
- Read the article.

765
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:41,847
Jordan, you look great.

766
00:40:42,047 --> 00:40:44,103
You're in a huge magazine.

767
00:40:52,855 --> 00:40:53,954
Calm the fuck down!

768
00:40:54,445 --> 00:40:55,469
What the hell's all this?

769
00:40:55,471 --> 00:40:58,117
It's the Forbes article. They
all wanna work for you now.

770
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,909
Hey, what did I say?!

771
00:41:01,612 --> 00:41:04,393
Hey, you want a job?
You talk to me!

772
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,822
Forbes had made me a superstar.

773
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:14,023
Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.

774
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,132
If we hired 'em,

775
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:18,313
they dropped out of
college overnight..

776
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:22,570
And spend whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Straten tailor.

777
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,132
Are you fuckin'
serious right now!

778
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,971
I mean, we're literally putting
clothes on these kids backs.

779
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,289
And here comes, this jerk
off sniffing around.

780
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,250
You know, everytime someone
rises up in the world.

781
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,769
There's always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down.

782
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,804
Within months, we
doubled in size,

783
00:41:42,003 --> 00:41:44,255
moved to even bigger offices.

784
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:53,105
It was a madhouse,
a greed-fest,

785
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:57,728
with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone and body fluids.

786
00:42:00,295 --> 00:42:01,355
It got so bad.

787
00:42:01,925 --> 00:42:03,909
I had to declare the
office a fuck-free zone,

788
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,269
between the hours of 9 and 7,

789
00:42:05,929 --> 00:42:08,202
but I'm telling you
even that didn't help.

790
00:42:08,409 --> 00:42:11,050
Actually the madness started
on our very first day,

791
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,434
when one of our
brokers, Ben Jenner,

792
00:42:13,635 --> 00:42:17,003
christened the elevator by getting
a blowjob from a sales assistant.

793
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,000
Her name was Pam
and to her credit,

794
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:21,469
she did have an amazing
technique, with this..

795
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,500
Wild twist and jerk motion.

796
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,731
About a month later,

797
00:42:25,931 --> 00:42:28,041
Donnie and I decided
to dowble-team her,

798
00:42:28,242 --> 00:42:31,536
On a Saturday afternoon while our wives
were out shopping for Christmas dresses.

799
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,849
Eventually Ben married
her, which was..

800
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:38,134
Pretty amazing considering she blew
every single guy in the office.

801
00:42:38,909 --> 00:42:41,538
He then got depressed and killed
himself three years later.

802
00:42:41,737 --> 00:42:45,188
Anyway, I hired my Dad
Max to maintain order,

803
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:46,389
As the enforcer.

804
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,530
Stratten's very own Gestapo.

805
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,329
We called him Mad Max because
of his hair-trigger temper,

806
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,519
which could be set off by something
as innocuous as a ringing telephone.

807
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:58,869
Who the fuck

808
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:03,507
has the goddamn gall to call
this house on a Tuesday night!

809
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,759
- Goddammit!
- You're gonna Miss it.

810
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:08,903
Oh, please tell me
something I don't know.

811
00:43:09,103 --> 00:43:12,963
I wait all week for the fucking
<i>Equalizer</i>. And they have to fucking...

812
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,521
Hello?... - Gene, how are you Gene?
<i>But, as soon as he picked up the phone.</i>

813
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:19,471
<i>He'd affect this weird
British accent.</i>

814
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,110
Right-eo. Gene that
will be great...

815
00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:22,610
Cheerio. <i>It was absolutely...</i>

816
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,699
The fucking half-wit!
<i>..bizzare.</i>

817
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,344
You missed it! <i>And He's
Mad Max all over again.</i>

818
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:32,210
Alright, tell me what happened.
What happened?

819
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:33,289
Well, he discovered..

820
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:35,867
- ..It was his mother's sister.
- Who is he? Who?

821
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:38,505
The main guy. You
know the main guy.

822
00:43:38,706 --> 00:43:41,538
It was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

823
00:43:41,681 --> 00:43:46,601
<i>Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know
everything we're doing at Straten.</i>

824
00:43:46,802 --> 00:43:48,005
Then, there's a big target.

825
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:51,610
- They get launched and stick?
- There's a bullseye..

826
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:52,809
The bullseye is a dollar sign.

827
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,329
Whoever, gets closer to the
dollar sign get the most bucks.

828
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,175
So, if he gets
hurts, what happens?

829
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,530
I don't think, he's
gonna get hurt.

830
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,969
They've got, like,
superhuman strength anyway.

831
00:44:04,168 --> 00:44:06,748
You can't look him
right in the eyes.

832
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:09,623
- You can't look him in the eye?
- That's a fact. It's on PBS.

833
00:44:09,824 --> 00:44:12,148
They get confused and
their wires get crossed.

834
00:44:12,347 --> 00:44:13,347
You gotta look like at the Chin.

835
00:44:13,547 --> 00:44:15,884
Looks like I'm look at you but
I'm lookin' at your Chin.

836
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:18,469
They're like the monalisa,

837
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:21,788
They find eye contact, like whever
you're standing at the room.

838
00:44:21,987 --> 00:44:22,987
Then, they lock it..

839
00:44:23,188 --> 00:44:25,148
But, there's a limit to
what we can do with him?

840
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:27,329
We're allowed to throw shit at
him. We're allowed to throw..

841
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:28,530
Foods..bananas..

842
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:31,570
But, for example, what I
wouldn't do is maybe like..

843
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:32,771
Tell him to pull his cock out..

844
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,594
And like get some of the girls
to fondle him or shit..

845
00:44:35,793 --> 00:44:37,155
Let's keep that in
our back pocket.

846
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,373
This guy's more about
thrown at the dartboard.

847
00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:41,840
The thing is... this
is their gift, okay.

848
00:44:42,269 --> 00:44:44,469
They're build to be thrown.
Like a lawn dart.

849
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,230
Their top is heavy. Like a lawn
dart, they're build for accuracy.

850
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,219
Can we bowl with this guy?

851
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,420
That's his fucking
brother, Robbie.

852
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:51,619
The brother is the bowling ball.

853
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,820
The brother,

854
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:54,724
you put a skateboard on him,
strapped him to a skateboard..

855
00:44:54,923 --> 00:44:55,923
And, toss him down an
alley at some pins.

856
00:44:56,123 --> 00:44:57,771
No, shit. That's interesting.

857
00:44:57,972 --> 00:44:58,972
Can we get that guy?

858
00:44:59,172 --> 00:45:00,851
We'll get that guy too.
But, it says here..

859
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,036
<i>This guy will show his cock.</i>

860
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:05,224
They're very ornery,
by the way.

861
00:45:05,425 --> 00:45:07,552
So, you gotta be careful.
With these litle guys, okay?

862
00:45:07,552 --> 00:45:08,552
Safety is first, alright?

863
00:45:08,769 --> 00:45:10,878
I want some of those fucking
Tranquilizer gun ready..

864
00:45:11,077 --> 00:45:12,117
To knock these fucker out.

865
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:14,130
Maze, taser guns?

866
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:15,329
A pallet gun, maybe?

867
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,965
No, pallet gun's gonna hurt 'em.
I just want 'em out!

868
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:21,318
I say, we stick with the
'loophole'. Right..okay?

869
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,590
If we don't consider him a human,
we consider him as an act.

870
00:45:23,789 --> 00:45:25,471
I think we're in the clear.

871
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,514
Like, you know like flying willanders,
you know a lot of those guys died,

872
00:45:27,715 --> 00:45:29,423
- Bu, they never sued anybody.
- The important thing..

873
00:45:29,623 --> 00:45:30,623
You guys gotta keep in mind is

874
00:45:30,824 --> 00:45:34,050
that these things gossip. They
get together and they gossip.

875
00:45:34,251 --> 00:45:36,239
- That's a good point. - And
the last thing that we need..

876
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,112
Is them getting together and say,
' oh, they made fun of us'..

877
00:45:39,311 --> 00:45:41,672
- It's gonna make Straten look
bad. - That's why I love you.

878
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:43,027
You think of shits like that.

879
00:45:44,648 --> 00:45:46,371
We treat it just like
one of us, okay?

880
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:49,239
One of us, copul
gobul one of us.

881
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:52,219
We accept them one of us.
Copul gobul one of us.

882
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:54,467
We accept them one of us.
Copul gobul one of us.

883
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,668
- Copul gobul one of us.
- Jordan!

884
00:45:55,867 --> 00:45:56,867
Your dad's coming.

885
00:45:57,068 --> 00:45:58,597
Something to do with the
American Express bill.

886
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,159
- Get him out of here?
- Yeah, lick my twat.

887
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,480
No, I'm serious.

888
00:46:07,425 --> 00:46:09,103
Make some shit up.

889
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:13,139
$430,000 dollars

890
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:16,407
...in one month, Jordy? Huh?

891
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:19,985
Four-hundred-and-fucking-
thirty-thousand fucking dollars..

892
00:46:20,186 --> 00:46:21,349
In one fucking month!

893
00:46:23,105 --> 00:46:24,608
They're business expenses.
Just relax.

894
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,170
Jordy, look what you got here?

895
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:27,369
Look at this.

896
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,824
26 thousand dollars for
one fucking dinner!

897
00:46:31,023 --> 00:46:32,023
Okay, no..no..no. This
could be explained.

898
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:35,208
Dad we had clients. We
had Pfi..Pfizer clients.

899
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:37,197
Right, the portal
house from Argentina.

900
00:46:37,398 --> 00:46:39,170
Expensive champagne, the wine..
We had to buy champange,

901
00:46:39,371 --> 00:46:41,891
And you got all the fucking sides.
Tell him what the sides were.

902
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:43,309
- I ordered sides, so..
- Sides?

903
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:44,670
$26,000

904
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,289
Worth of sides?!

905
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,900
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

906
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:50,947
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

907
00:46:51,146 --> 00:46:52,146
They were up there. That's
why they were expensive.

908
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:54,079
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm seriou..

909
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,280
Stop.

910
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,509
And, EJ Entertainment.

911
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,594
What the fuck is
EJ Entertainment?!

912
00:46:58,793 --> 00:47:01,271
Well..that's uh..

913
00:47:01,472 --> 00:47:03,282
Yeah, Jordan. What's
EJ Entertainment?!

914
00:47:03,483 --> 00:47:04,483
Jordan what is that?

915
00:47:04,682 --> 00:47:06,331
It's a fucking
prostitution ring, Jordy.

916
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,530
That's what it is!

917
00:47:07,731 --> 00:47:08,731
That is what it is.

918
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:11,045
Isn't that the perfect,
description for them?

919
00:47:11,244 --> 00:47:12,326
That is what it is... but..

920
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:13,445
None of this were charged to me.

921
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:15,079
This is all of them.

922
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,949
Oh, it's all us?

923
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:18,952
It wasn't me though. Fucking
explain this shit to him.

924
00:47:19,152 --> 00:47:21,244
These are all your fucking
charges! Right here.

925
00:47:21,445 --> 00:47:24,298
The IRS they allow for
T&A, that's fine.

926
00:47:24,498 --> 00:47:27,603
T&E - T&E. - I said, T&E.

927
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:28,804
- No, you said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

928
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:30,739
Yeah, you did. Yeah, you did.

929
00:47:31,096 --> 00:47:32,514
You said T&A. It's T&E.
Alright?

930
00:47:32,715 --> 00:47:35,034
I know you're upset about the
dinner. And that makes sense.

931
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,989
B'cos, we did spend too much
money. But, I said T&E.

932
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,894
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

933
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:41,215
- Dad, he said T&A.
- He did.

934
00:47:41,295 --> 00:47:42,981
- He said T&A.
- Absolutely, no question.

935
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,380
I'm getting this close!

936
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:47,579
That's what I'm saying.

937
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,079
I want you to open up more, Max.

938
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:50,201
He's gonna fucking kill you.

939
00:47:50,365 --> 00:47:51,365
Why do you hold it in?

940
00:47:51,565 --> 00:47:53,878
- Max, Max..Why do you
hold it in? - That's it.

941
00:47:54,077 --> 00:47:55,478
That's it. Get the
fuck out of here.

942
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:01,173
- What kinda hookers take
credit card? - A rich one!

943
00:48:01,409 --> 00:48:03,251
In Stratton, there were
three kinds of hookers.

944
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:05,440
The blue chips, top of the line.
Model material.

945
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:08,869
They cost between $300 and $500
and you had wear a condom.

946
00:48:09,068 --> 00:48:10,068
Unless, you gave
them a hefty tip,

947
00:48:10,268 --> 00:48:12,309
which of course, I always did.

948
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,619
Then came NASDAQs,

949
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:16,110
who were pretty,
but not great,

950
00:48:16,164 --> 00:48:17,983
They cost betweem two
to three hundred bucks.

951
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,009
Finally there were
pink sheets, skanks.

952
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:22,838
They cost about a
hundred or less,

953
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,088
and if you didn't wear a condom, you'd
get a penicillin shot the next day,

954
00:48:26,288 --> 00:48:27,688
and pray your dick
didn't fall off.

955
00:48:28,019 --> 00:48:29,380
Not that we didn't
fuck them, too.

956
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,297
Believe me, we did.

957
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,599
It's that slip disc thing again.

958
00:48:34,798 --> 00:48:35,880
I know what it is. You know,

959
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:38,791
too much..with EJ entertainment.

960
00:48:40,123 --> 00:48:41,349
How are things at home?

961
00:48:41,548 --> 00:48:42,548
Well, not the best.

962
00:48:42,748 --> 00:48:45,835
It just doesn't... you
know what I'm saying.

963
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:47,036
It's like the smell..

964
00:48:47,235 --> 00:48:49,612
There's a smell, there's attraction
thing and after a while,

965
00:48:49,813 --> 00:48:50,813
It just kinda fades
away a little bit..

966
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:53,193
Yeah, well..it's
supposed to fade away.

967
00:48:53,393 --> 00:48:54,965
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage.

968
00:48:55,164 --> 00:48:56,246
You know, your mother and I.

969
00:48:56,364 --> 00:48:58,380
- We've been married a
long long time. - I know.

970
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:00,985
What do you think? We're jumping
into bed every two minutes?

971
00:49:01,186 --> 00:49:02,791
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

972
00:49:02,992 --> 00:49:05,143
I wanna stay married, Dad.
But..uh..

973
00:49:05,344 --> 00:49:06,344
It's crazy out there.

974
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,307
Some of these girls, you
should see them. Oh my God!

975
00:49:09,507 --> 00:49:12,673
They're fucking..the things
they're doing now, Pops.

976
00:49:12,873 --> 00:49:15,231
I mean..it's whole
on another level.

977
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:16,992
- Really?
- And, they're all shaved too.

978
00:49:17,085 --> 00:49:18,871
- Get out of here!
- They're all shaven.

979
00:49:19,097 --> 00:49:22,155
- Are you kidding me? No bush?
- Bald as a China-doll.

980
00:49:22,355 --> 00:49:23,967
- No, bush.
- Oh my God!

981
00:49:24,168 --> 00:49:28,391
All of a sudden, One week. Nobody'd
anything down there, anywhere.

982
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:31,123
- It's a new world. - They're
bald from the eyebrows down.

983
00:49:31,324 --> 00:49:33,244
- Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitches.

984
00:49:33,443 --> 00:49:35,516
- Like lasers.
- Wow, new world, see?

985
00:49:35,717 --> 00:49:38,201
I was born too, too.. early.

986
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,853
I've never been a fan
of bush, to be honest.

987
00:49:41,054 --> 00:49:42,054
- Really?
- Yeah.

988
00:49:42,253 --> 00:49:43,253
I don't mind it.

989
00:49:43,454 --> 00:49:44,454
Dad..

990
00:49:44,653 --> 00:49:47,291
I don't want you stressing
out about any of these.

991
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:48,490
How can I not get stressed out?

992
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,347
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you?

993
00:49:50,547 --> 00:49:53,117
I know they're knuckleheads but
I need 'em to live like me.

994
00:49:53,318 --> 00:49:55,065
You get it? To lived like me.

995
00:49:55,266 --> 00:49:56,266
Jordy,

996
00:49:56,465 --> 00:50:00,342
one of these days, the chickens
are gonna come home to roost.

997
00:50:02,954 --> 00:50:04,521
You're looking at
me like I'm crazy.

998
00:50:04,722 --> 00:50:05,722
Crazy?

999
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:07,505
This is Obscene!

1000
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:10,806
It was obscene... in
the normal world.

1001
00:50:11,005 --> 00:50:13,981
But, who wanted to live there?

1002
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:26,090
Fucking magic! I love this!

1003
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:31,021
We got minds up here, that's
gonna take this company.

1004
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:34,827
Into the fucking stratosphere!

1005
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,697
Jor-Dan! Jor-Dan! Jor-Dan!

1006
00:50:42,757 --> 00:50:44,603
Fuck Merrill Lynch, Fuck them.

1007
00:50:44,804 --> 00:50:45,804
Why should they be taking
all the fucking money,

1008
00:50:46,003 --> 00:50:47,166
all the fucking time.

1009
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,539
It was our next big move.

1010
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:51,840
Finding companies
to take public.

1011
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,389
IPOs.

1012
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,719
It was the only way, these
Wall Street pricks..

1013
00:50:55,721 --> 00:50:57,282
Would ever stop thinking
of us as some..

1014
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,927
...shit kicker bucket shot.

1015
00:50:59,128 --> 00:51:00,288
We've got Arncliffe National,

1016
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,222
See, we were a little different.

1017
00:51:02,422 --> 00:51:03,422
We liked to get as
fucked up as possible.

1018
00:51:03,621 --> 00:51:05,677
During our business pow-wows.

1019
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:08,000
In order to stimulate
our free flowing ideas.

1020
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:11,101
Which is why, we're popping
these ludes like they're M&Ms.

1021
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:16,376
We own the fuckin' comp..

1022
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,019
We own the company... <i>Don't
know what a lude is?</i>

1023
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:20,219
I'll tell you.

1024
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,186
Ah, wait. Wait wait wait.

1025
00:51:22,387 --> 00:51:24,264
Looks like those ludes,

1026
00:51:24,465 --> 00:51:27,411
are woking their magic
on Donnie right now.

1027
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:01,947
The Qualude.

1028
00:52:02,146 --> 00:52:04,876
Or 'lude' as it is
commonly referred to.

1029
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:08,965
Was first synthesized in
1951 by an Indian doctor.

1030
00:52:09,164 --> 00:52:10,168
That's not feathers..

1031
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,608
...as a sedative..

1032
00:52:11,807 --> 00:52:15,867
And was prescribed to stressed out
housewives with sleep disorders.

1033
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:17,068
But, pretty soon..

1034
00:52:17,268 --> 00:52:18,268
Someone figured out..

1035
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:21,949
That if you resisted the urge
to sleep for fifteen minutes,

1036
00:52:22,148 --> 00:52:24,601
you got a pretty
kick-ass high from it.

1037
00:52:24,802 --> 00:52:28,748
Didn't take long for people to
start abusing ludes, 'course,

1038
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:31,440
and in 1982 the U.S. Government
Schedule One'd them,

1039
00:52:31,639 --> 00:52:33,942
along with the
rest of the world.

1040
00:52:34,389 --> 00:52:37,429
Which meant there was only a finite
amount of these things left.

1041
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:41,221
No shit, you can't
even buy 'em anymore.

1042
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,677
You people're all
shit outta luck.

1043
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,827
- What is it?
- Steeef Maddin..

1044
00:52:47,027 --> 00:52:48,027
Steeef Maddin..

1045
00:52:48,226 --> 00:52:49,226
- Steeef..
- Steeef.

1046
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,030
You remember those ads?

1047
00:52:53,023 --> 00:52:55,141
Those giant headed girls
with the bunked eyes,

1048
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,581
wearing those big clunky shoes.

1049
00:52:57,003 --> 00:52:58,717
My friend from
school Steve Madden.

1050
00:52:58,918 --> 00:53:00,590
His friend from
school Steve Madden.

1051
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,663
Steve Madden was 'The name' in
women shoes at that moment and,

1052
00:53:03,862 --> 00:53:07,123
and all of Wall Street was begging
to take his company public.

1053
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,228
Except, guess who
grew up with him?

1054
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:11,429
Women shoes. Women shoose.

1055
00:53:11,628 --> 00:53:14,436
My very own Vice President.

1056
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,802
Diamond Donnie Azoff.

1057
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:25,083
Jordan, you better come check
this fucking Chick out.

1058
00:53:25,282 --> 00:53:26,867
Look.

1059
00:53:32,181 --> 00:53:34,373
I would fuck that girl,
if she was my sister.

1060
00:53:34,574 --> 00:53:37,344
I would let that girl,
give me fucking aids.

1061
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:44,201
- She's hot.
- Cristy.

1062
00:53:50,815 --> 00:53:52,382
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1063
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:53,583
- Hi.
- Naomi.

1064
00:53:53,782 --> 00:53:54,782
Nice to meet you.

1065
00:53:54,989 --> 00:53:56,309
Naomi, Nice to meet you.

1066
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,342
You have an awesome place here.

1067
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:01,329
I don't think I've ever been in
a house like this big before.

1068
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,530
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
- Beautiful beach out there..

1069
00:54:03,289 --> 00:54:04,389
Blair Hollingsworth.

1070
00:54:06,005 --> 00:54:07,126
Hi. Buddy, nice to meet you.

1071
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:08,856
- Name's Blair right?
- Yeah.

1072
00:54:09,056 --> 00:54:10,056
You like to jet ski?

1073
00:54:10,255 --> 00:54:11,295
I've never done it before.

1074
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:13,039
You've never jet-ski'Ed
in your life?!

1075
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:14,929
- No, I've never jet-ski'Ed. -
You've never been to jet-ski'Ed..

1076
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,550
- No, I haven't. - How many
times you gonna ask her,

1077
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,750
She's never been on a jer ski.

1078
00:54:17,949 --> 00:54:20,550
I don't know, I might ask
her a couple more times.

1079
00:54:20,751 --> 00:54:21,751
Okay.

1080
00:54:24,396 --> 00:54:25,724
Hi, I'm Hildy.

1081
00:54:25,925 --> 00:54:26,925
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1082
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:28,731
Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

1083
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:29,931
Yeah. I'll be out in
couple of minutes.

1084
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:31,744
Just tell her, I'll be out
in couple of minutes.

1085
00:54:31,945 --> 00:54:33,344
Why don't you tell your
wife that? - How am I

1086
00:54:33,344 --> 00:54:34,742
to do that, when I'm
having a conversation?

1087
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:37,340
- What am I, your secretary?
- I think, we should get going.

1088
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:38,949
Wait, wait. Where're
you guys going?

1089
00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:40,695
We gotta go. We got two other
parties we're supposed to get to.

1090
00:54:40,894 --> 00:54:41,894
- We can stay for a drink.
- Yes, stay for a drink.

1091
00:54:42,094 --> 00:54:44,844
No, we got two other parties
we're supposed to get to. so..

1092
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:46,719
Why don't you let
her stay for a bit.

1093
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,166
Let her stay for a bit.
What's the big deal?

1094
00:54:49,365 --> 00:54:50,965
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1095
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:53,447
Donnie, what the
fuck are you doing?

1096
00:54:53,646 --> 00:54:54,646
You piece of shit!

1097
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:04,996
You guys're gonna have
to excuse my friend.

1098
00:55:04,996 --> 00:55:05,996
Get the fuck out of here!

1099
00:55:11,086 --> 00:55:13,182
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

1100
00:55:13,382 --> 00:55:14,382
That's fucking rude!

1101
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,434
So, Bay Ridge. That's near
Staten Island, right?

1102
00:55:22,434 --> 00:55:24,851
Brooklyn, across the
Verrazano Bridge.

1103
00:55:25,052 --> 00:55:27,012
- Saturday night fever,
territory. - That's right.

1104
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:28,168
Guinea gulch.

1105
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,679
We call the Verrazano
Bridge Guinea gang point.

1106
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:33,690
So, I presume, You're Italian?

1107
00:55:33,891 --> 00:55:34,891
On my dad's side.

1108
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:38,228
I'm also Dutch,
German, English..

1109
00:55:38,427 --> 00:55:39,427
...I'm a mutt.

1110
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:40,628
Oh, you're a mutt.

1111
00:55:40,827 --> 00:55:43,554
Yeah. Actually, I have family
over there, in London.

1112
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:44,755
My Aunt Emma.

1113
00:55:44,954 --> 00:55:45,954
She's the best.

1114
00:55:46,155 --> 00:55:49,411
Very British, you know?
Classy Lady.

1115
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:50,612
That explains it then.

1116
00:55:50,811 --> 00:55:51,811
Explains what?

1117
00:55:52,012 --> 00:55:53,259
Explains you. I mean..

1118
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:54,458
You're a Duchess, right.

1119
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:57,045
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1120
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:01,146
Excuse me?

1121
00:56:01,346 --> 00:56:03,416
Can I get a straw please?

1122
00:56:05,018 --> 00:56:06,585
Thank you.

1123
00:56:08,918 --> 00:56:10,523
So, I was umm..

1124
00:56:10,722 --> 00:56:14,079
...a little surprised you
asked Cristy for my number.

1125
00:56:15,632 --> 00:56:17,143
Why's that?

1126
00:56:18,965 --> 00:56:20,423
Aren't you married?

1127
00:56:21,641 --> 00:56:22,753
Well..

1128
00:56:22,954 --> 00:56:23,954
Yeah, but..what?

1129
00:56:24,153 --> 00:56:26,614
Married people can't
have friends?

1130
00:56:28,505 --> 00:56:30,250
We're gonna be friends?

1131
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:31,449
Yeah.

1132
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,422
You don't wanna be my friend?

1133
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,403
We are not gonna be friends.

1134
00:56:49,112 --> 00:56:51,226
...and at night I
work my designs.

1135
00:56:51,427 --> 00:56:53,751
I have an entire
line of lingerie..

1136
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:56,626
Camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1137
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,264
She designs panties, too?

1138
00:57:00,463 --> 00:57:02,943
Oh my God!

1139
00:57:12,467 --> 00:57:14,748
C'mon, Jordan, think of a way
to get up to her apartment?!

1140
00:57:20,545 --> 00:57:22,416
You wanna come up for
some tea or something?

1141
00:57:24,384 --> 00:57:25,367
Tea? Yeah.

1142
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,760
- Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

1143
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,960
Sounds nice.

1144
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:31,527
Tea. Fuck yeah. I want
to come up for tea.

1145
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:35,534
Darjeeling..Rosettes..or
something of that shit..

1146
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:36,733
Rocky. Who's this.

1147
00:57:37,757 --> 00:57:40,304
- Say hi, Rocky.
- Hi, sweet heart.

1148
00:57:43,072 --> 00:57:45,326
Why don't you light a fire?
I'll be right out.

1149
00:57:45,525 --> 00:57:47,581
- Fire here.
- Sure.

1150
00:57:51,043 --> 00:57:53,322
I like painting
here, It's uh...

1151
00:57:59,802 --> 00:58:02,297
God, help me. How do
I fuck this girl?

1152
00:58:06,371 --> 00:58:07,813
- You allright?
- Yeah, yeah. Just,

1153
00:58:08,014 --> 00:58:10,101
Trying to light a fire here.

1154
00:58:15,269 --> 00:58:17,951
That's it, you're leaving. Don't get
involved. Go home to your wife.

1155
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:29,699
As you can probably guess,

1156
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:33,358
I fucked her goddamn brains out.

1157
00:58:37,987 --> 00:58:39,827
For eleven seconds.

1158
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:51,679
Did you just cum?

1159
00:58:51,878 --> 00:58:52,878
Oh, yeah. I just came.

1160
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:57,387
- Did you..did you come?
- No.

1161
00:58:57,586 --> 00:58:58,586
No? Okay.

1162
00:58:58,786 --> 00:59:01,463
I'm still hard. Just give
me a sec to get going.

1163
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:02,663
Sure.

1164
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:17,449
Oh, God!

1165
00:59:17,648 --> 00:59:18,648
Fuck off, Rocky!

1166
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:21,117
- Bad dog. - Give him a
biscuitt or something..

1167
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:22,318
It's okay.

1168
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:23,518
Just keep going.

1169
00:59:23,717 --> 00:59:25,474
Go, play Rocky. Go..go.

1170
00:59:28,878 --> 00:59:30,989
You're crazy. <i>I
couldn't get enough</i>.

1171
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:33,375
I mean, her pussy was
like heroin to me.

1172
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,168
It wasn't just about
the sex, either.

1173
00:59:36,369 --> 00:59:37,369
Naomi and I got along.

1174
00:59:37,568 --> 00:59:40,260
I mean, we had similar
interest and shits.

1175
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,940
Woohoo. Shit!

1176
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:25,097
You, get out of the fucking car!

1177
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:28,461
Sick son of a bitch.

1178
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,835
Just relax, sweetheart. Relax..

1179
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,400
Son of a fucking bitch!

1180
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:37,599
Stop, please.

1181
01:00:39,974 --> 01:00:42,159
- What are you doing home?
- That whore from the party?

1182
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:43,019
Jesus Christ!

1183
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:44,219
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1184
01:00:44,489 --> 01:00:47,079
I thought you were at
the fucking beach..

1185
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,280
That's where you've
fucking been?

1186
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,989
With that fucking whore
from the party?!

1187
01:00:51,188 --> 01:00:53,548
How could you do this to me?!

1188
01:00:55,269 --> 01:00:56,429
Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1189
01:00:56,829 --> 01:00:59,585
You're like a completely
different fucking person!

1190
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:01,983
I made a mistake, I don't
know what to tell you babe.

1191
01:01:02,182 --> 01:01:03,182
I'm sorry.

1192
01:01:05,081 --> 01:01:07,079
- I am sorry.
- Is that what you want?

1193
01:01:17,793 --> 01:01:19,170
Do you love her?

1194
01:01:24,938 --> 01:01:26,289
Answer me.

1195
01:01:47,998 --> 01:01:49,847
I felt horrible.

1196
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,949
Three days later, I
filed for divorce

1197
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:54,813
and moved Naomi
into the apartment.

1198
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:02,340
Say what you will, but the
Duchess did have style.

1199
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:05,576
She brought in a decorator,
feng shui'd the place...

1200
01:02:05,775 --> 01:02:08,005
she even hired a gay Butler.

1201
01:02:08,206 --> 01:02:10,101
This guy was smart,
sophisticated,

1202
01:02:10,302 --> 01:02:12,650
professional, I
mean..really, really great.

1203
01:02:12,851 --> 01:02:13,851
Jasmine?

1204
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,664
Yes, Sir. I tried to stump you
this evenning. Very good..

1205
01:02:16,864 --> 01:02:19,170
Very good. Great nose!

1206
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:21,336
Except for that, one time.

1207
01:02:25,804 --> 01:02:26,855
Omigod!

1208
01:02:29,068 --> 01:02:30,172
Oh, hey.

1209
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,454
Is it wenesday already?

1210
01:02:33,965 --> 01:02:34,989
What the fuck?

1211
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,949
That is fucked up!

1212
01:02:38,103 --> 01:02:41,054
He must have thought, we're still at
the Hamptons this weekend you know..

1213
01:02:41,255 --> 01:02:43,373
Where were they doing, sweeheart? In
the bedroom? - They're everywhere.

1214
01:02:43,574 --> 01:02:44,574
There were two guys over
there on the table,

1215
01:02:44,773 --> 01:02:46,398
There were more over here.

1216
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:47,599
- They were more right here.
- Oh, God!

1217
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:50,556
You're fucking serious. Right
there? Why didn't you tell me..

1218
01:02:50,755 --> 01:02:52,791
Baby it gets worse.

1219
01:02:54,242 --> 01:02:56,690
After they left, I
checked the apartment.

1220
01:02:56,889 --> 01:02:57,889
What?

1221
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:00,052
What is it babe? What?

1222
01:03:00,251 --> 01:03:01,389
Where is my money?

1223
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:04,644
- I don't know where they are. -
Where's my fucking money? Where is it?

1224
01:03:04,844 --> 01:03:06,677
I don't know where your
money is Mr. Belfort.

1225
01:03:06,876 --> 01:03:08,978
- I didn't do anything.
- He's lying Jordan,

1226
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:10,179
He's lying through
his fucking teeth!

1227
01:03:10,378 --> 01:03:11,378
Let' start from the beginning.

1228
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:14,534
Let' start from the beginning. Alright?
You invited friends over, right?

1229
01:03:14,735 --> 01:03:16,655
One thing let to another.
Things got out of hand.

1230
01:03:16,733 --> 01:03:18,009
We understand that, we do.

1231
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:20,648
We do blow all the time. We are
fucking degenerates ourselves.

1232
01:03:20,835 --> 01:03:21,835
Look at us.

1233
01:03:22,034 --> 01:03:24,835
The money was stolen from my
apartment. Right from my sock drawer.

1234
01:03:25,036 --> 01:03:26,036
- Alright?
- As I said,

1235
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:28,132
- I don't know about money..
- Just start from the begining.

1236
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:30,085
- Who came over?
- It's just a normal day.

1237
01:03:30,286 --> 01:03:31,286
I knew you're coming
home the next day.

1238
01:03:31,485 --> 01:03:33,519
So, everything will be fine.
It'll be cleaned up.

1239
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:35,387
I got a little high,
at breakfast.

1240
01:03:35,586 --> 01:03:37,438
I got a little happy,
I had some eggs,

1241
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:40,518
I had a little bit of ice cream. I
said, who I knew that likes ice cream.

1242
01:03:40,601 --> 01:03:41,601
That's my frined Rudy.

1243
01:03:41,802 --> 01:03:43,061
- So, I call Rudy.
- Who's Rudy?

1244
01:03:43,262 --> 01:03:44,262
Yeah, Who's Rudy?

1245
01:03:45,769 --> 01:03:47,632
You know, who Rudy is.
Come on.

1246
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:49,119
- You know who he is?
- I don't know fuck..

1247
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,797
Who the fuck's Rudy?

1248
01:03:50,996 --> 01:03:53,213
- I don't know any one name Rudy.
- Last month, the Lollypop Club.

1249
01:03:53,414 --> 01:03:54,653
You know who Rudy was, dancing.

1250
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,061
- You know... Rudy?
- I don't..I..I eh..

1251
01:03:59,019 --> 01:03:59,989
What do you mean?

1252
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:01,190
So, he went to the
Lollypop Club?

1253
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:04,992
Oh, he was at the Lollypop club for sure.
On the stage, griding with everybody..

1254
01:04:05,193 --> 01:04:06,554
I got fucked up. I
like to dance...

1255
01:04:07,672 --> 01:04:10,313
Maybe, I met him. Maybe I didn't..
I meet a lot of fucking peoplel.

1256
01:04:10,626 --> 01:04:13,112
Fifty thousand dollars was stolen
from my fucking socks drawer.

1257
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:15,420
All my girlfriend's jewellery..

1258
01:04:15,603 --> 01:04:17,469
- What the fuck?
- Your fucking faggot friend..

1259
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:18,469
...Rudy take my shit.

1260
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:20,090
Did he? Answer me.

1261
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,822
Okay, now I get it.

1262
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:23,021
Now I get why.

1263
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,599
This is a gay thing.
I see. All of you.

1264
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,047
You think this is
b'cos you're fag?

1265
01:04:28,248 --> 01:04:29,949
My cousin is a fucking faggot.

1266
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:32,900
And I go on vacation with him
and his boyfriend. I love fags!

1267
01:04:33,606 --> 01:04:35,559
I will not be stolen from.
You get that?

1268
01:04:35,759 --> 01:04:37,639
I fucking like gay people.
But I don't like you.

1269
01:04:47,489 --> 01:04:49,181
Talk, you fuck. Talk!

1270
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,349
I'm gonna drop you, fucking..
Where is it?

1271
01:04:51,949 --> 01:04:54,802
Chester and Toby they went
all Yakuza on Nicholas.

1272
01:04:55,003 --> 01:04:56,003
They got crazy.

1273
01:04:57,829 --> 01:05:00,349
I had to call the cops just to
keep 'em for killing the poor guy.

1274
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:04,139
I gave 'em each a thousand bucks and
told them what Nicholas had done.

1275
01:05:04,338 --> 01:05:06,173
And they kicked his ass.

1276
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,746
Thanks again, officers.

1277
01:05:08,117 --> 01:05:10,878
It's not like I cared about
the fifty grand anyway.

1278
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,239
I was making that much alnost everyday
through one rathole or the other.

1279
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,369
Now, 'rathole' is a friend.

1280
01:05:16,929 --> 01:05:17,789
Like, Brad here.

1281
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,905
Who helps stock in
his name from me.

1282
01:05:23,561 --> 01:05:24,905
I drive the price up.

1283
01:05:25,106 --> 01:05:27,713
Then, he'd sell and kick
most of the profit back to..

1284
01:05:27,914 --> 01:05:29,891
You guessed it.. me.

1285
01:05:32,797 --> 01:05:34,548
All cash. None of
it on the books.

1286
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:37,349
A big 'no, no' of course
in the eyes of the law.

1287
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,393
Enter our new Securities
Attorney, Manny Riskin.

1288
01:05:41,592 --> 01:05:43,809
700 bucks an hour,
to be the voice..

1289
01:05:44,469 --> 01:05:45,813
- ..Of DOOM.
- Listen to me,

1290
01:05:46,012 --> 01:05:48,302
You piss on the SEC's leg, you'll
end up with your tits in a ringer.

1291
01:05:48,501 --> 01:05:50,842
Will you not worry about it.
I got the SEC in control.

1292
01:05:51,469 --> 01:05:53,579
What the fuck is this
imbecile doing?!

1293
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,548
Hey, hey. What're you doing?

1294
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:59,048
Hey! We got the SEC in here.

1295
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:03,867
The Securities and Exchange Commission
sent two lawyers down to review our files,

1296
01:06:04,067 --> 01:06:06,030
so, I set them up in
our conference room.

1297
01:06:06,231 --> 01:06:09,240
And, I had it bugged and the air
conditioning turned up so high,

1298
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,297
that it felt like
Antarctica in there.

1299
01:06:11,496 --> 01:06:12,737
Is it always this cold in here?

1300
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:13,730
I don't know.

1301
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:17,358
Then, while they were, looking
for a smoking gun in that room.

1302
01:06:19,469 --> 01:06:21,630
I was gonna fire off
a bazooka in here.

1303
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,139
Offering up our latest IPO.

1304
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,630
An IPO is an initial
public offering,

1305
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:30,951
the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

1306
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:33,028
Now, as the firm taking
the company public,

1307
01:06:33,228 --> 01:06:36,909
We set the initial price, then sold
those shares back to our friends.

1308
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,110
Look,

1309
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,309
I know, you're not following
what I'm saying. Anyway, right?

1310
01:06:41,309 --> 01:06:43,014
That's okay. That
doesn't matter.

1311
01:06:43,215 --> 01:06:44,751
The real question is this,

1312
01:06:44,952 --> 01:06:46,445
was all this legal?”.

1313
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:49,181
Absolutely, fucking not!

1314
01:06:49,382 --> 01:06:51,849
But, we were making more money
that we knew what to do.

1315
01:06:56,063 --> 01:06:59,103
What do you do, when you're making more
money than, you know what to do with?

1316
01:07:05,061 --> 01:07:06,469
Omigod!

1317
01:07:06,668 --> 01:07:07,668
Will you Marry me?

1318
01:07:07,869 --> 01:07:09,664
Omigod!

1319
01:07:09,864 --> 01:07:11,708
Is that a 'Yes'?

1320
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:16,088
Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
Yeah, I'm sure.

1321
01:07:16,288 --> 01:07:18,132
- Are you sure?
- Yeah!

1322
01:07:28,326 --> 01:07:32,061
I held my bachelor party at
the Mirage, in Las Vegas.

1323
01:07:32,262 --> 01:07:34,375
The flight there
alone, was a Baccanal!

1324
01:07:34,574 --> 01:07:37,905
One last blowout for the Gods
before I settled down for good.

1325
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:39,724
A hundred Strattonites.

1326
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:43,994
Fifty hookers plus fifty
more waiting once we landed.

1327
01:07:44,364 --> 01:07:45,699
Oh, and the drugs..I mean,

1328
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,141
I tell you our plane was
a pharmacy with wings.

1329
01:08:18,744 --> 01:08:19,520
All told,

1330
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,680
the weekend cost me
two million bucks.

1331
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,880
Including the cost of refurbishing
the entire 28th floor.

1332
01:08:28,314 --> 01:08:29,786
Kiss the bride.

1333
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,640
But, the wedding was like
something out of a fairy tale.

1334
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,289
...with Naomi my Duchess,

1335
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:39,430
me her handsome Duke..

1336
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:43,081
...and The Bahamas
Ocean Club our castle.

1337
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:54,908
Of course, after
that bachelor party,

1338
01:08:54,909 --> 01:08:58,689
Me..the Duke needed a few
penicillin shots so he could..

1339
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:01,079
...safely consummate,
the marriage.

1340
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:08,639
Hey..I'm Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

1341
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,408
A few words, huh.
For your son.

1342
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:12,239
Jordan, remember
what I told you.

1343
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:14,270
It involves your penis..

1344
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,038
...and her vagina.

1345
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:17,914
You know, you know it.

1346
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,675
You can do it, Jordy.

1347
01:09:36,984 --> 01:09:38,949
Omigod! Aunt Emma!

1348
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,545
Oh, God! You came!

1349
01:09:46,219 --> 01:09:47,011
Jordan!

1350
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:48,534
Jordan! Look, who came.

1351
01:09:49,449 --> 01:09:50,595
It's Aunt Emma.

1352
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:52,755
Aunt Emma!

1353
01:09:53,529 --> 01:09:55,529
- Jordan dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how're you doing?

1354
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,787
Pleasure to finally
meet you, in person.

1355
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:00,359
Into the donuts, I see.

1356
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:04,420
Oh, I'm... uh...

1357
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,001
I lived through
the 60s, my dear.

1358
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,619
Enjoy the day.

1359
01:10:09,454 --> 01:10:10,659
She surprised me!

1360
01:10:11,649 --> 01:10:13,251
- I didn't even know.
- It's huge honour.

1361
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:29,184
- Just one more step. Keep your
eyes closed. - Where are we going?

1362
01:10:29,671 --> 01:10:30,810
One, Two..three!

1363
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:34,641
What is this?

1364
01:10:34,841 --> 01:10:36,341
- It's your wedding present!
- What?

1365
01:10:36,541 --> 01:10:38,895
It's your wedding, sweetheart.

1366
01:10:40,956 --> 01:10:42,765
Are you serious?

1367
01:10:42,965 --> 01:10:45,069
A fucking Yacht?!

1368
01:10:45,269 --> 01:10:47,752
<i>For millionaires, who's
ships have come in.</i>

1369
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:50,255
<i>Priceless boats offers
the most fun afloat.</i>

1370
01:10:50,725 --> 01:10:53,003
<i>It's no coincidence
that this 150 feet..</i>

1371
01:10:53,203 --> 01:10:55,104
<i>..of Steel hull is
the color of cash.</i>

1372
01:10:55,304 --> 01:10:56,304
Anchors Away!

1373
01:10:56,439 --> 01:10:57,520
Oh, my God!

1374
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:58,720
Baby!

1375
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:01,699
Do you like it?

1376
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:04,088
You like it? Yes!

1377
01:11:09,645 --> 01:11:12,421
For three weeks, we sailed the
Naomi through the Caribbean.

1378
01:11:12,622 --> 01:11:13,622
Eventually, taking her
home to Long Island,

1379
01:11:13,822 --> 01:11:15,877
where we'd bought a house.

1380
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:18,309
Seven acres on the Gold
Coast of Long Island.

1381
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:20,809
The most expensive real
estate in the world,

1382
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:23,309
with maids, cooks,
landscapers, you name it.

1383
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:25,430
We even had two guards
who worked in shifts,

1384
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:28,332
Both, named Rocco.

1385
01:11:31,443 --> 01:11:33,362
It was heaven on Earth.

1386
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:38,109
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1387
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:39,310
Who's Venice?

1388
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:40,510
Who?

1389
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:44,016
Who? - Who? What are
you a fucking owl?!

1390
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:45,216
Who's she?

1391
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:46,965
Some little hooker you
were fucking last night?

1392
01:11:47,164 --> 01:11:48,164
What the fuck are
you talking about?!

1393
01:11:48,364 --> 01:11:49,364
No. No, way! Baby.

1394
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:50,545
No!

1395
01:11:50,744 --> 01:11:52,824
You were calling her
name in your sleep.

1396
01:11:53,024 --> 01:11:54,024
Are you out of you
fucking mind?!

1397
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:57,703
I don't..I don't even
know who Venice is.

1398
01:11:57,903 --> 01:11:59,962
What the fuck does that
even mean? Venice.

1399
01:12:00,162 --> 01:12:02,943
That's the stupidiest shit I've
ever heard in my fucking life!

1400
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:08,166
Venice?

1401
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,520
Venice baby where are you?

1402
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:12,720
Venice?

1403
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:15,997
Venice?!

1404
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:17,198
Where did you go? Huh?

1405
01:12:23,024 --> 01:12:24,402
You're going rough huh?

1406
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:26,423
Ah...! Jesus Christ!

1407
01:12:28,923 --> 01:12:30,539
I like it. I like it.

1408
01:12:30,739 --> 01:12:31,739
Wolfie..wolfie. Wolfie!
Wolfie.

1409
01:12:31,939 --> 01:12:32,939
Wolfie.

1410
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,024
- Wolfie?
- Yes, it's my 'safe' word baby.

1411
01:12:35,224 --> 01:12:36,224
- It's my 'safe' word!
- I don't give a fuck,

1412
01:12:36,423 --> 01:12:37,423
about your safe word.

1413
01:12:37,623 --> 01:12:38,623
Shut the fuck up!

1414
01:12:40,421 --> 01:12:41,694
Shut up, you little bitch.

1415
01:12:41,894 --> 01:12:44,457
You fucking dirty little Birdie!

1416
01:12:45,664 --> 01:12:46,938
That's right!

1417
01:12:47,137 --> 01:12:48,137
That's right, I forgot.

1418
01:12:49,328 --> 01:12:50,039
I forgot baby.

1419
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:51,239
Donnie and I,

1420
01:12:51,449 --> 01:12:54,484
we're investing in a
condo complex in Venice.

1421
01:12:54,685 --> 01:12:56,393
- That's why..that's why all this
confusion. - Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1422
01:12:57,479 --> 01:12:59,305
Not Italy. California, baby.

1423
01:12:59,505 --> 01:13:00,505
- Oh, California?
- Yeah.

1424
01:13:00,704 --> 01:13:01,864
You're a lying piece of shit!

1425
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:04,520
- Duchess, baby, come on. -
Don't you fucking 'Duchess' me.

1426
01:13:04,712 --> 01:13:05,712
Don't you 'Duchess' me.

1427
01:13:05,912 --> 01:13:07,770
- I'm sorry.
- Do you really think,

1428
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:08,970
That, I don't know
what you're up to?

1429
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:11,578
You're a father now, Jordan.
Yeah.

1430
01:13:11,779 --> 01:13:15,302
You're a father now and
you act like an infant!

1431
01:13:15,502 --> 01:13:16,502
Fuck.

1432
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:20,546
Goddamn it! Baby, you know.
You got real anger issues!

1433
01:13:20,746 --> 01:13:22,760
Who was the one
who flew in here,

1434
01:13:23,109 --> 01:13:26,168
at three in the morning
on a stupid helicopter..

1435
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:27,368
And, woke up Skylar?!

1436
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,381
That was you. How about that?

1437
01:13:29,581 --> 01:13:31,738
- Does it even matters to you?
- Fucking bullshit!

1438
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,350
Does it even matter to you,

1439
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:45,882
that I just had that
driving range..

1440
01:13:46,082 --> 01:13:47,082
Sodded with Bermuda..

1441
01:13:47,283 --> 01:13:49,390
Grass, Jordan?

1442
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:50,590
And, now.. You
fucking wrecked it.

1443
01:13:50,789 --> 01:13:52,923
No. You didn't researched
the whole thing

1444
01:13:53,123 --> 01:13:55,429
and dealt with the fucking
golf course people!

1445
01:13:55,949 --> 01:13:58,847
Oh, my God! You had to deal with
the gold course people too!

1446
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,860
What a great tragedy.
Honey, Oh my God!

1447
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,060
You probably had to
pay them in cash..

1448
01:14:03,261 --> 01:14:06,055
...with your hands,
What a fucking burden.

1449
01:14:06,256 --> 01:14:07,256
And actually, do
some work besides,

1450
01:14:07,456 --> 01:14:10,581
swiping my fucking credit
card all day, huh?

1451
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,917
Cos, I can't keep track of
your professions honey.

1452
01:14:13,117 --> 01:14:14,942
Cos last month, you're
a wine connoisseur.

1453
01:14:15,141 --> 01:14:17,492
Now, you're an aspiring
landscape architect?!

1454
01:14:17,692 --> 01:14:19,414
- Let me get that right.
- Fuck you!

1455
01:14:19,614 --> 01:14:22,092
Don't fucking dare.. Throw
that fucking water at me.

1456
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:23,662
Don't fucking dare.

1457
01:14:23,862 --> 01:14:24,862
All right, honey?

1458
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:28,997
We can talk this out. Alright?

1459
01:14:29,086 --> 01:14:30,086
We'll just use our words.

1460
01:14:30,286 --> 01:14:31,286
You know?

1461
01:14:31,485 --> 01:14:34,067
Communicate. Okay?

1462
01:14:35,268 --> 01:14:38,003
Come on, sweetheart.
Talk to me..talk to me.

1463
01:14:38,203 --> 01:14:40,515
Stop flexing your
muscless, Jordan.

1464
01:14:40,715 --> 01:14:41,715
You look like a
fucking imbecile.

1465
01:14:41,914 --> 01:14:43,907
Babe, come on. You
should feel..

1466
01:14:44,106 --> 01:14:46,356
...feel happy you
got a husband..

1467
01:14:46,556 --> 01:14:49,225
Who's in such great
shape like this, Huh?

1468
01:14:49,425 --> 01:14:50,425
Come here.

1469
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:52,434
C'mon, give me a kiss.

1470
01:14:52,634 --> 01:14:54,498
You look so beautiful right now.
C'mon!

1471
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:55,698
Kiss you?

1472
01:14:55,899 --> 01:14:57,314
- Kiss you?
- Yeah, give me one...

1473
01:14:58,962 --> 01:15:00,274
Fuck You!

1474
01:15:00,475 --> 01:15:01,475
Ah yes..

1475
01:15:01,869 --> 01:15:02,747
My morning ritual.

1476
01:15:02,948 --> 01:15:07,043
First, I'd get up and fight with Naomi
about whatever I did the night before.

1477
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:08,560
Next it was a steam,

1478
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,364
so, I could sweat out the
drugs, still in my system.

1479
01:15:11,564 --> 01:15:12,685
Then. I'd assess the damage.

1480
01:15:12,829 --> 01:15:14,367
Drown out my eyeballs..

1481
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:17,904
Take my back pills” to
get the day started,

1482
01:15:18,104 --> 01:15:20,376
then, seek to make
up with Naomi.

1483
01:15:20,576 --> 01:15:21,576
Good morning Daddy.

1484
01:15:21,775 --> 01:15:24,140
Where's my kiss?

1485
01:15:29,016 --> 01:15:32,591
Does Daddy get to kiss both
his little girls, huh?

1486
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:33,792
Ohhh, no!

1487
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:36,972
No, Daddy doesn't even
get to touch Mommy..

1488
01:15:37,172 --> 01:15:40,815
For a very, very..
Very long time.

1489
01:15:41,546 --> 01:15:43,922
Daddy is really sorry about
what he said in the other room,

1490
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:45,122
He didn't mean any of it.

1491
01:15:45,323 --> 01:15:47,511
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1492
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:49,900
And, from now on..

1493
01:15:51,337 --> 01:15:55,993
It's going to be nothing but short,
short skirts around the house!

1494
01:15:58,646 --> 01:16:00,935
And, you know something
else, Daddy?

1495
01:16:02,663 --> 01:16:08,152
And Mommy's so sick and
tired of wearing panties,

1496
01:16:10,072 --> 01:16:11,840
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1497
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:16,395
In fact..

1498
01:16:16,595 --> 01:16:23,565
She's decided to
throw them all away.

1499
01:16:29,545 --> 01:16:31,481
So, take a good look, Daddy.

1500
01:16:31,681 --> 01:16:35,251
You're gonna be seeing an awful
lot of this around the house,

1501
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:41,136
but, no touching.

1502
01:16:47,122 --> 01:16:49,297
What's wrong, Daddy?

1503
01:16:55,237 --> 01:16:56,837
Look at this shit.

1504
01:16:57,716 --> 01:17:00,198
Mommy, likes to play
games with daddy.

1505
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:08,333
Mommy, have you ever notice, anything
odd about Mr. Fuzzy Bear, over there?

1506
01:17:10,806 --> 01:17:13,384
His eye seems to be a
little bit odd, Don't they?

1507
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:17,788
Yeah, there's something a little
bit different about his eyes.

1508
01:17:17,988 --> 01:17:18,988
Hah! Yes,

1509
01:17:19,189 --> 01:17:20,863
I think it's true.
Say, 'Hi, Mommy',

1510
01:17:21,064 --> 01:17:22,953
Say, 'Hi' to Rocco and Rocco.

1511
01:17:23,153 --> 01:17:24,153
Hi, fellas!

1512
01:17:24,353 --> 01:17:25,353
See that, huh?

1513
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:29,260
Of all the fucking days, she choose
just today to give me blue balls.

1514
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:32,569
Today's the biggest day
in Stratten's history.

1515
01:17:32,769 --> 01:17:34,479
And, I needed to be
thinking straight.

1516
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:35,680
Hey, Jordan.

1517
01:17:36,270 --> 01:17:37,871
- Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

1518
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:41,797
This was the day, that we
launched the Steve Madden IPO.

1519
01:17:41,997 --> 01:17:44,097
The troops are all here.
Everyone's rallied, excited.

1520
01:17:44,099 --> 01:17:47,030
Everything had to run tight.
It had to be perfect.

1521
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,511
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1522
01:17:49,675 --> 01:17:50,844
What's he doing?

1523
01:17:51,043 --> 01:17:55,210
The biggest IPO in this firm's
history, What the fuck is he doing?

1524
01:17:56,988 --> 01:17:58,619
Is he wearing a bow-tie?

1525
01:17:58,819 --> 01:17:59,819
Hi.

1526
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:03,029
- How're you doing?
- Good.

1527
01:18:04,512 --> 01:18:06,217
You cleaning your fishbowl?

1528
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,046
I just..I had a minute.

1529
01:18:09,246 --> 01:18:10,246
You had a minute.

1530
01:18:10,445 --> 01:18:12,895
And, today..you needed to
clean your fish bowl. Today?

1531
01:18:13,095 --> 01:18:16,802
I had finished my paperwork and I
was..just had a couple of minutes.

1532
01:18:17,002 --> 01:18:18,002
Okay.

1533
01:18:18,203 --> 01:18:20,273
Nice to meet you.

1534
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:26,670
On new issue day?!

1535
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,577
On cocksucking, motherfucking
new issue day?!

1536
01:18:30,777 --> 01:18:32,494
This is what you do?!

1537
01:18:32,694 --> 01:18:33,694
Hey, everybody?!

1538
01:18:33,895 --> 01:18:34,895
Listen up.

1539
01:18:35,095 --> 01:18:39,024
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

1540
01:18:52,123 --> 01:18:54,444
Now take your bowtie,
get your shit, and..

1541
01:18:54,644 --> 01:18:57,457
Get the fuck out of my office, you
understand? - Get the fuck out!

1542
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:02,279
Everybody on point!

1543
01:19:02,609 --> 01:19:05,738
We are here, to make money.
Everybody on point!

1544
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:09,738
A real wolf pit.

1545
01:19:09,938 --> 01:19:10,938
Which is exactly,
how I liked it.

1546
01:19:11,137 --> 01:19:13,809
Jordan. Look what I caught in
the lobby? I caught a genius.

1547
01:19:14,009 --> 01:19:15,020
Enter, Steve Madden.

1548
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,270
Red Hot ladies
footwear <i>impresario</i>.

1549
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:21,880
And, thanks to Donnie, We were
taking his company public.

1550
01:19:22,689 --> 01:19:26,365
Stratten Oakmont was crawling
out of it's primerial loose.

1551
01:19:26,565 --> 01:19:28,167
Pond scum, no more.

1552
01:19:28,368 --> 01:19:30,288
That's why they gotta
see your face.

1553
01:19:30,488 --> 01:19:31,488
You get 'em fired up so they'll
push the shit out of this stock.

1554
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:33,750
Okay? <i>And not only that.</i>

1555
01:19:34,252 --> 01:19:37,948
Donnie and I secretly owned
85% of Steve Madden shoes.

1556
01:19:38,369 --> 01:19:40,309
Which legally speaking
was a big NO NO.

1557
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:43,613
But, we'll get filthy fucking rich,
If our troops got behind it.

1558
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:45,631
Our job was to get
'em worked up.

1559
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,520
But, not too worked up.

1560
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:50,310
Hello, if uh..

1561
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,539
For those of you
who don't know me,

1562
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,060
...my name is Steve Madden.

1563
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:57,300
Yeah, we know who you are.

1564
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:58,460
Your name is on the box.

1565
01:19:58,659 --> 01:20:01,559
The shoes. Show them the shoes.
Show them the shoes.

1566
01:20:01,759 --> 01:20:06,250
This shoe..it is pretty cool.
This is the Mary Lou..

1567
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,600
Which is the one that
really put me on the map.

1568
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,943
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1569
01:20:10,909 --> 01:20:12,287
Believe it or not.

1570
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:13,528
Believe it or not, though.

1571
01:20:13,688 --> 01:20:16,051
The Mary Lou is actually
the same as the Mary Jane.

1572
01:20:16,252 --> 01:20:18,126
But, it's black leather.

1573
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:26,989
All right,

1574
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,899
let's give it up for Steve
Madden and his awesome Mary Lou!

1575
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:32,377
Hold that up, hold that up.

1576
01:20:32,577 --> 01:20:35,064
Hold that up, proud. Give
him a round of applause.

1577
01:20:36,699 --> 01:20:39,078
You got that out of
your system, huh?

1578
01:20:39,859 --> 01:20:41,860
You're having a good
afternoon or what?

1579
01:20:42,779 --> 01:20:45,399
I wanna take a moment to
tell you why Steve is so..

1580
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,342
Absolutely, off
the fucking wall.

1581
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:52,914
It's because this man
is a creative genius.

1582
01:20:53,729 --> 01:20:56,565
This ability, this
gift that Steve has..

1583
01:20:56,779 --> 01:20:57,979
It goes beyond just..

1584
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,604
Spotting the hottest
shoe trends.

1585
01:21:00,805 --> 01:21:04,122
Steve's power, is that
he creates trends.

1586
01:21:04,323 --> 01:21:05,323
You understand?

1587
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:08,302
Artists like Steve come
along once every decade!

1588
01:21:08,502 --> 01:21:10,591
I'm talking, Giorgio Armani!
Gianni Versace!

1589
01:21:10,791 --> 01:21:12,869
CoCo Chanel! Yves Saint Laurent!

1590
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:15,481
Steve, come up
here for a second.

1591
01:21:15,681 --> 01:21:16,921
I don't think you all realise..

1592
01:21:18,626 --> 01:21:21,976
That Steve Madden is
the hottest person,

1593
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,257
in the women shoe industry,

1594
01:21:23,377 --> 01:21:25,853
with orders going through
the roof at every

1595
01:21:25,854 --> 01:21:28,328
department store in North
America, right now.

1596
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:31,166
We have him here in our office.

1597
01:21:32,198 --> 01:21:34,774
We should thank our fucking
lucky stars this man is here.

1598
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:37,226
We should be on our hands
and knees right now,

1599
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:39,587
getting ready to
suck this guy off.

1600
01:21:40,739 --> 01:21:42,250
Like this, okay?

1601
01:21:42,449 --> 01:21:43,570
I wanna suck you off, Steve.

1602
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:46,020
Everyone's gonna suck you off.

1603
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:51,180
This is our Golden ticket to the
fucking chocolate factory, right here.

1604
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:54,649
And, I wanna meet Willy
'Fucking' Wonka. Okay?

1605
01:21:55,779 --> 01:21:58,579
I wanna be with the fucking
Oompa Loompas like this.

1606
01:22:03,381 --> 01:22:05,101
Get off this fucking stage.
Get out of here.

1607
01:22:05,268 --> 01:22:06,298
All right.

1608
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,779
I want you all to
focus for a second.

1609
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:10,421
See that little black boxes?

1610
01:22:10,621 --> 01:22:11,819
They are called a telephones.

1611
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:14,261
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret about this telephones.

1612
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:16,807
They're not gonna dial
themselves! Okay?

1613
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:18,619
Without you...

1614
01:22:18,819 --> 01:22:21,564
They're just worthless
hunk of plastic.

1615
01:22:21,765 --> 01:22:23,635
Like a loaded M16 without a..

1616
01:22:23,835 --> 01:22:25,823
...trained Marine to
pull the trigger.

1617
01:22:26,845 --> 01:22:28,573
And in the case
of the telephone,

1618
01:22:28,773 --> 01:22:31,632
It's up to each and
everyone of you,

1619
01:22:33,525 --> 01:22:35,270
My highly trained Strattonite,

1620
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,460
My killers.

1621
01:22:38,689 --> 01:22:41,720
My Killers who will not
take no for an answer!

1622
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,221
My fucking warriors

1623
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,239
who'll not hang up the phone,

1624
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,340
until their clients
either buys..

1625
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:53,423
...or fucking dies!

1626
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,039
Let me tell you something.

1627
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,949
There is no nobility in poverty.

1628
01:23:12,369 --> 01:23:14,569
I've been rich, and
I've been poor man.

1629
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:17,591
And I choose rich every time.

1630
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:21,801
Cos, At least as a rich man,
when I have to face my problems,

1631
01:23:22,001 --> 01:23:23,240
I show up in the back of a limo

1632
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:25,000
wearing a $2000 suit

1633
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,710
...and $40,000 gold
fuckin' watch!

1634
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:38,569
Now, if anyone here
thinks I'm superficial..

1635
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:40,751
...or materialistic.

1636
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,912
Go get the fuck out and
get a job at McDonald's,

1637
01:23:43,913 --> 01:23:45,824
because that's where
you fucking belong!

1638
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:50,130
But, before you depart
this room full of winners,

1639
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,551
I want you to take a good look at
the person next to you, go on.

1640
01:23:55,975 --> 01:23:57,734
Because one day in the
not-so-distant future,

1641
01:23:58,289 --> 01:24:00,920
you're pullin' up to a red light
in your beat-up old Pinto,

1642
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,869
and that person's gonna pull
up right along side you

1643
01:24:05,069 --> 01:24:07,567
in a brand new Porsche,

1644
01:24:07,766 --> 01:24:12,435
with their gorgeous young wife by his
side. Who's got big voluptous tits.

1645
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:16,118
And who will you be next to?

1646
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:21,176
Some disgusting wilderbeast with three days
of razor-stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo,

1647
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:25,118
crammed in next to you with a carload full
of groceries from the fucking Price Club!

1648
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:27,159
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to.

1649
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:29,529
So, you listen to me
and you listen well.

1650
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,069
Are you behind, on your
credit card bills?

1651
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,479
Good. Pick up the phone
and start dialing.

1652
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,560
Is your landlord
ready to evict you?

1653
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,000
Good. Pick up the phone
and start dialing.

1654
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:43,130
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking loser?

1655
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:46,649
Good. Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1656
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:48,739
I want you to deal
with your problems,

1657
01:24:49,069 --> 01:24:50,529
by becoming rich!

1658
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:54,039
All you have to do today

1659
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:55,520
...is pick up that phone..

1660
01:24:57,439 --> 01:24:59,819
And speak the words
that I have taught you.

1661
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:02,073
And I'll make you richer

1662
01:25:02,273 --> 01:25:06,113
than the most powerful CEO of the
United States of fucking America.

1663
01:25:09,449 --> 01:25:10,569
I want you to go out there,

1664
01:25:12,981 --> 01:25:14,157
And I want you to RAM

1665
01:25:14,356 --> 01:25:17,850
Steve Madden stock down
your clients' throats.

1666
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:20,371
Till they fucking choke on it

1667
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,430
till they choke on it and buy 10,000
shares! That's what I want you to do.

1668
01:25:26,109 --> 01:25:27,680
You'll Be ferocious!

1669
01:25:28,659 --> 01:25:30,122
You'll Be relentless!

1670
01:25:30,322 --> 01:25:33,981
You'll Be telephone
fucking terrorists!

1671
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:39,918
Now, let's knock this
Motherfucker out of the park!

1672
01:26:08,859 --> 01:26:13,954
At 1 P.M. we opened the stock
for sale at $4.50 a share.

1673
01:26:14,154 --> 01:26:16,689
By 1:03 it was over
eighteen dollars.

1674
01:26:17,289 --> 01:26:19,140
Even the big Wall Street
firms were buying.

1675
01:26:29,637 --> 01:26:31,577
Of the two million shares
being offered for sale,

1676
01:26:31,578 --> 01:26:34,326
a million belonged to me, held in
phony accounts by my ratholes.

1677
01:26:34,525 --> 01:26:36,524
Now, once the price
hit the high teens,

1678
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:38,960
You know what? Who
gives a shit.

1679
01:26:39,159 --> 01:26:40,159
As always, the point is this...

1680
01:26:40,359 --> 01:26:45,713
22 million in three
fucking hours!

1681
01:26:46,579 --> 01:26:47,810
Can you believe it.

1682
01:26:51,047 --> 01:26:52,105
Jordan.

1683
01:26:52,305 --> 01:26:54,914
Barry Kleinman's on the
phone from Future Video.

1684
01:26:55,114 --> 01:26:57,034
- A who? - I don't know.
He shot at your wedding.

1685
01:26:57,090 --> 01:26:58,090
He says, it's urgent.

1686
01:26:58,289 --> 01:26:59,810
Urgent? Who the fuck's
Barry Kleinman?

1687
01:27:00,222 --> 01:27:02,840
Oh, my God. You wanna Marry me?
You're in love with me?

1688
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,180
Yeah, go fuck your cousin.

1689
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:05,340
Barry, what's up?

1690
01:27:05,581 --> 01:27:08,153
- Listen, I got a subpoena.
- Subpoena?

1691
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:09,353
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1692
01:27:09,552 --> 01:27:11,689
The FBI wants a copy
of your wedding video.

1693
01:27:11,889 --> 01:27:14,253
The F-B-fucking-I? You
fucking kidding me?

1694
01:27:14,453 --> 01:27:15,989
Listen to me, His
Name's Denham,

1695
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:17,920
he's an agent in the
New York office.

1696
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:20,280
- What's his problem?
- He's a boy scout,

1697
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,789
...thinks you're Gordon Gekko.

1698
01:27:22,989 --> 01:27:24,824
What does he want with
my wedding video?

1699
01:27:25,024 --> 01:27:27,345
It's like invasion of my privacy,
You know what I'm saying.

1700
01:27:27,461 --> 01:27:29,222
It's intrusive..you know.

1701
01:27:29,422 --> 01:27:31,853
He's got your pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

1702
01:27:32,052 --> 01:27:33,052
Pictures, names of the people..

1703
01:27:33,252 --> 01:27:36,493
You know what he's trying to do. Exactly,
what's he's doing now. Look at yourself.

1704
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:37,600
He's trying to rattle you.

1705
01:27:37,761 --> 01:27:41,645
He's trying to rattle your old lady. So,
she'll nags you to be a fuckin' witness.

1706
01:27:41,845 --> 01:27:43,387
Oh, He wants me
to rat on myself?

1707
01:27:43,587 --> 01:27:45,841
He wants me to give
information about my..what?

1708
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:48,563
The good fucking news is, you
know I know everybody downtown,

1709
01:27:48,762 --> 01:27:51,171
I called The Justice
Department, The DEA..

1710
01:27:51,371 --> 01:27:54,685
Nobody even know you fucking
exists, so calm down.

1711
01:27:54,885 --> 01:27:56,899
- They don't know I exist?
- No.

1712
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:58,100
That's good.

1713
01:28:03,922 --> 01:28:06,884
- You know who he is right?
- Yeah.

1714
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:10,680
So, if I just wanted to get some more
information, just find out what he knows,

1715
01:28:12,636 --> 01:28:15,028
we could go to his house right?
Tap his phones a little bit,

1716
01:28:15,029 --> 01:28:19,417
- ..bug in get a little information.. -
You don't fuck with these guys like that,

1717
01:28:19,618 --> 01:28:21,751
you don't fuck with him like that.
What are you nuts or something?

1718
01:28:21,951 --> 01:28:23,912
That's what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

1719
01:28:23,912 --> 01:28:25,824
I have a fucking P.I
license you know.

1720
01:28:26,024 --> 01:28:27,988
I make a living at this,
I'm not a cop anymore.

1721
01:28:28,188 --> 01:28:29,947
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, alright?

1722
01:28:30,146 --> 01:28:31,146
Okay.

1723
01:28:31,346 --> 01:28:33,356
Okay, if I can't do that,

1724
01:28:33,556 --> 01:28:35,815
Can I just..can I
give the guy a call?

1725
01:28:37,306 --> 01:28:39,994
Why is that..Jordan.
Jordan do me a favor.

1726
01:28:40,194 --> 01:28:43,087
The only one who calls this
guy is your fucking lawyer.

1727
01:28:44,438 --> 01:28:47,661
I told you, whatever the
fuck you say to him,

1728
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:50,399
He's gonna used it against you.
Don't you understand?

1729
01:28:50,599 --> 01:28:53,246
- He is smart, you are dumb.
- Fucking bullshit.

1730
01:28:53,445 --> 01:28:55,966
- I'm not allowed to call him. -
Are we fucking talking tonight?

1731
01:28:56,426 --> 01:28:58,530
The last time you took these
fucking pills, you put..

1732
01:28:58,532 --> 01:29:00,958
Your head in fucking micooven,
I'm not making it up.

1733
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:03,810
Okay, I won't call.

1734
01:29:07,863 --> 01:29:09,344
Hey, fellas! C'mon aboard!

1735
01:29:09,543 --> 01:29:10,543
Plank's right down there.

1736
01:29:12,637 --> 01:29:14,185
Welcome.

1737
01:29:14,386 --> 01:29:15,386
What a nice day.

1738
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:19,920
Welcome aboard.

1739
01:29:21,725 --> 01:29:23,966
Jordan, Welcome aboard to Naomi.
Pleasure to meet you.

1740
01:29:24,166 --> 01:29:25,923
I'm Agent Denham.
This is Agent Hughes.

1741
01:29:26,123 --> 01:29:27,797
Hi, how are you? Let
me introduce you.

1742
01:29:27,997 --> 01:29:29,921
This is Nicole. Heidi, come on.
Don't be shy.

1743
01:29:30,122 --> 01:29:32,753
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

1744
01:29:32,953 --> 01:29:35,314
- These are friends of Stratten.
- It's a Pleasure. - Hello.

1745
01:29:38,618 --> 01:29:41,395
Your message said that, you
wanted to speak privately.

1746
01:29:41,595 --> 01:29:43,493
Right. I do want to
speak privately.

1747
01:29:43,693 --> 01:29:44,693
Give us a minute, huh, Ladies.

1748
01:29:44,893 --> 01:29:47,613
Let me know if I can get you
anything. We'd be happy to help.

1749
01:29:48,619 --> 01:29:49,699
You guys hungry?

1750
01:29:49,899 --> 01:29:52,689
If you want something to eat. We
got some pasta, shrimp, lobster,

1751
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:54,824
I got whiskey, anykind
of booze you want?

1752
01:29:55,024 --> 01:29:58,033
You know what, the bureau doesn't
allow us to drink when we are at sea.

1753
01:29:58,233 --> 01:30:00,523
Duh? Of course.

1754
01:30:00,722 --> 01:30:01,722
Ever been on one
of these before?

1755
01:30:01,922 --> 01:30:03,797
A boat?

1756
01:30:04,952 --> 01:30:06,287
I learned to sail
when I was six.

1757
01:30:06,488 --> 01:30:07,488
No, shit. Is that right.

1758
01:30:08,649 --> 01:30:09,850
I mean, one like this, though.

1759
01:30:10,025 --> 01:30:12,942
I had the whole front extended
to put a chopper up there.

1760
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:14,141
See that?

1761
01:30:16,108 --> 01:30:17,360
Anyway, this is for you.

1762
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:20,341
It's a complete list of every
person that was at my wedding.

1763
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:22,895
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video,

1764
01:30:23,095 --> 01:30:25,456
I figured this would help expedite
the whole process, right?

1765
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:26,587
There you go.

1766
01:30:26,787 --> 01:30:28,886
Look. My point is that.

1767
01:30:29,087 --> 01:30:30,743
I know you're
investigating Stratton,

1768
01:30:30,943 --> 01:30:34,143
but, for the life of me
I can't figure out why.

1769
01:30:34,342 --> 01:30:36,581
I know we are a little
unorthodox; We're a little...

1770
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:38,059
loud in the way we do things.

1771
01:30:38,259 --> 01:30:41,817
You gotta understand, trying
to make a name for ourselves.

1772
01:30:42,016 --> 01:30:47,386
But, I want you to understand,
we don't do anything illegal.

1773
01:30:47,587 --> 01:30:49,351
Whatsoever.

1774
01:30:49,551 --> 01:30:51,797
You could talk to the SEC,
They're at my office,

1775
01:30:51,997 --> 01:30:54,288
fifteen times, over the
last six month, so..

1776
01:30:54,488 --> 01:30:56,487
I got nothing to hide.

1777
01:30:56,686 --> 01:30:59,590
You know, The SEC's a
civil regulatory agency.

1778
01:30:59,789 --> 01:31:00,911
We pursue criminal activity.

1779
01:31:00,989 --> 01:31:01,989
Exactly.

1780
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:03,949
You go after real criminal.
Which...

1781
01:31:04,934 --> 01:31:07,909
makes me wonder, what the hell
you're investigating me for?

1782
01:31:08,109 --> 01:31:09,109
I mean, honestly. What..

1783
01:31:09,189 --> 01:31:13,118
What is it that you think, that
we did or do. I don't get it.

1784
01:31:13,318 --> 01:31:14,318
Well,

1785
01:31:14,518 --> 01:31:17,185
Jordan, I can't discuss
ongoing investigations.

1786
01:31:17,385 --> 01:31:18,506
No, I get that. I understand.

1787
01:31:18,585 --> 01:31:19,585
With that said.

1788
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:22,925
This case got
dumped on my desk.

1789
01:31:23,125 --> 01:31:24,164
You know, by a higher up..

1790
01:31:24,324 --> 01:31:27,472
Who needs to make a show of
looking into the new company,

1791
01:31:27,672 --> 01:31:29,949
on the block. The whole
press and everything.

1792
01:31:30,149 --> 01:31:32,550
I end up being the smuck
who does the looking.

1793
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:33,750
Exactly.

1794
01:31:33,949 --> 01:31:35,310
It's just..you know,
it bothers me.

1795
01:31:35,609 --> 01:31:36,779
We are the new guy.

1796
01:31:36,979 --> 01:31:38,668
We're the one that's banging
on Wall Streets door, man.

1797
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:41,309
You should see what's going
on at the bigger firm.

1798
01:31:41,509 --> 01:31:42,609
I know all the information.

1799
01:31:42,609 --> 01:31:43,659
It's true.

1800
01:31:43,859 --> 01:31:45,926
Goldman, Leyman
Brothers, Merrill.

1801
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:49,273
Collateralized debt obligations?
This Internet stock bullshit?

1802
01:31:49,472 --> 01:31:50,472
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

1803
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:53,506
I mean, I could take
you step-by-step,

1804
01:31:53,706 --> 01:31:57,465
to what exactly is occuring. You
know, all you have to do is ask.

1805
01:31:57,664 --> 01:31:58,664
I'm available.

1806
01:31:59,654 --> 01:32:01,095
That's exactly what
I wanted to hear.

1807
01:32:01,206 --> 01:32:03,654
I don't see why, a little
sit down like this.

1808
01:32:04,855 --> 01:32:06,393
Can't be profitable
for the both of us.

1809
01:32:06,592 --> 01:32:08,953
It should, right? It should
be profitable for us.

1810
01:32:09,154 --> 01:32:10,154
- It should.
- Look?

1811
01:32:10,354 --> 01:32:12,494
I'm gonna give you
my personal line,

1812
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:15,592
five days a week you
just call me. Feel free.

1813
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:17,956
- I'll do that.
- Great.

1814
01:32:20,283 --> 01:32:22,346
Are you sure you guys don't
want something to drink?

1815
01:32:22,347 --> 01:32:24,036
I mean, you're not hungry.
Nothing?

1816
01:32:24,235 --> 01:32:26,097
- Oh, no.
- No?

1817
01:32:29,136 --> 01:32:30,064
Let me ask you.

1818
01:32:30,264 --> 01:32:33,264
And if you don't wanna get too personal,
just tell me to shut up at anytime.

1819
01:32:34,543 --> 01:32:36,990
Did you try to get your
broker's license at one time?

1820
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:38,190
Did I hear that right?

1821
01:32:38,390 --> 01:32:40,329
Were you trying to take
a stab at Wall Street?

1822
01:32:41,578 --> 01:32:42,887
Who've you been talking to?

1823
01:32:43,087 --> 01:32:45,275
- Who the fuck have you been talking
to? - Well, you're investigating me..

1824
01:32:45,475 --> 01:32:47,867
I hear things. You
see what I mean?

1825
01:32:49,079 --> 01:32:50,890
You ever think about,
what would've happened.

1826
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:53,077
If you've..you know,
stayed the course?

1827
01:32:54,626 --> 01:32:56,592
You know what. When I'm
riding home on the subway,

1828
01:32:56,792 --> 01:33:00,030
And, my balls are fucking sweating. I'm
wearing the same suit, three days in row.

1829
01:33:00,230 --> 01:33:01,230
Yeah, you bet I do.

1830
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:03,342
I thought about it, before.
Who wouldn't, right?

1831
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:04,465
Right, who fucking wouldn't.

1832
01:33:04,543 --> 01:33:06,466
I mean, you got.. Another
personal question.

1833
01:33:06,667 --> 01:33:08,479
- You don't need to answe..
- No, it's alright Jordan.

1834
01:33:08,679 --> 01:33:11,520
What are you pulling? 50-60K
something like that, a year?

1835
01:33:15,595 --> 01:33:16,555
Let's put it this way.

1836
01:33:16,756 --> 01:33:19,425
You get a free handgun, when
you sign up for the bureau.

1837
01:33:20,489 --> 01:33:21,878
No. But, it fucking
pisses me off.

1838
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:22,880
You know what I mean.
You think about,

1839
01:33:23,079 --> 01:33:26,524
the people that build this country,
hardworking people like you.

1840
01:33:26,724 --> 01:33:29,064
You know, firefighters,
teachers, FBI agents.

1841
01:33:29,264 --> 01:33:32,889
End of the day, you guys get fucking
skinned to life, financially.

1842
01:33:33,088 --> 01:33:34,088
Fucking makes me angry.

1843
01:33:35,347 --> 01:33:37,699
That's the one thing about Wall
Street and this market is.

1844
01:33:37,899 --> 01:33:43,010
For me, I feel, it's good to
give back. You know, there's

1845
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:45,298
there's situations..
where I can.

1846
01:33:45,498 --> 01:33:48,365
Make those situations
better for people.

1847
01:33:48,565 --> 01:33:49,565
You know.

1848
01:33:50,953 --> 01:33:53,273
Opportunity, is everything.

1849
01:33:53,472 --> 01:33:54,472
Exactly.

1850
01:33:54,672 --> 01:33:57,073
Yeah, for example. I got
this one kid, right.

1851
01:33:58,551 --> 01:34:01,268
Went to school for environmental
science or something like that.

1852
01:34:01,467 --> 01:34:03,268
He was bogged down
by student's loans.

1853
01:34:03,467 --> 01:34:05,945
Turns out, his mother needed
triple bypass surgery.

1854
01:34:06,145 --> 01:34:07,145
Horrible situation.

1855
01:34:07,345 --> 01:34:10,350
But, we got him in at the
market at the right time.

1856
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:11,569
Choose the right stock.

1857
01:34:11,569 --> 01:34:12,609
We gave him the right guidance.

1858
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:16,073
Boom. Overnight, changes
his entire life.

1859
01:34:16,273 --> 01:34:19,770
You know, he got to put his mother in
the best hospital in New York City.

1860
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:23,197
It didn't work out for her, granted
she passed away, unfortunately.

1861
01:34:23,396 --> 01:34:26,137
But, we gave him that opportunity,
you know what I'm saying.

1862
01:34:26,337 --> 01:34:29,087
It's just about setting up
the right team and then,

1863
01:34:29,287 --> 01:34:31,832
overnight, your life can change.

1864
01:34:37,207 --> 01:34:38,947
What is..intern..uh..

1865
01:34:40,988 --> 01:34:43,204
What does an intern make
off on a deal like that?

1866
01:34:43,404 --> 01:34:44,404
On that situation..

1867
01:34:44,604 --> 01:34:48,145
On that particular trade.
One trade.

1868
01:34:48,345 --> 01:34:51,427
North of half a million dollars.

1869
01:34:55,599 --> 01:34:57,372
And, I'd do that for anybody.

1870
01:34:57,573 --> 01:35:00,909
You know, anybody that
needs the proper guidence.

1871
01:35:20,409 --> 01:35:22,481
Can you say that again?

1872
01:35:22,681 --> 01:35:24,358
Just the way, you said it.

1873
01:35:24,557 --> 01:35:25,557
Just the same way.

1874
01:35:30,409 --> 01:35:31,953
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1875
01:35:31,954 --> 01:35:33,675
No..come on you know
what I'm talking about.

1876
01:35:33,744 --> 01:35:35,583
Just say the same thing. I think,
what Jordan just did is he..

1877
01:35:35,783 --> 01:35:36,783
If I'm not mistaken.

1878
01:35:36,984 --> 01:35:39,543
You just tried to bribe
a Federal Officer.

1879
01:35:39,743 --> 01:35:41,801
No, technically, I
didn't bribe anybody.

1880
01:35:43,506 --> 01:35:45,664
According to the
US Criminal Code,

1881
01:35:45,864 --> 01:35:49,036
there needs to be exact dollar
figure for the exchange of services.

1882
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:51,213
That would not hold up
in the court of law.

1883
01:35:53,974 --> 01:35:54,895
That's the truth, But..

1884
01:35:55,024 --> 01:35:56,519
I wanna tell you this, - Yeah.

1885
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:00,027
The same gentleman, that told me you
tried to get your broker's license,

1886
01:36:00,226 --> 01:36:02,010
also told me that you
are a straight arrow.

1887
01:36:02,210 --> 01:36:03,210
He ran a security check on me.

1888
01:36:03,409 --> 01:36:04,409
Well..

1889
01:36:06,413 --> 01:36:09,944
I'm on a boat fit for a bond villain
sometimes you need to play the part, right?

1890
01:36:11,470 --> 01:36:14,574
I think it's time you both get the
fuck off my boat. What do you say?

1891
01:36:16,064 --> 01:36:17,728
You know, Jordan. I'll
tell you something.

1892
01:36:17,729 --> 01:36:20,117
Most of the Wall Street
jackasses I bust,

1893
01:36:22,332 --> 01:36:24,132
- they were born to the life.
- Is that right?

1894
01:36:24,863 --> 01:36:26,157
Their father was a douchebags.

1895
01:36:26,356 --> 01:36:28,301
Just like their
fathers before them.

1896
01:36:28,502 --> 01:36:29,502
But you,

1897
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:34,764
You Jordan, you got this
way all on your own.

1898
01:36:34,963 --> 01:36:35,963
Did I?

1899
01:36:36,163 --> 01:36:37,163
Good for you, little man.

1900
01:36:37,363 --> 01:36:38,363
Little man?

1901
01:36:38,564 --> 01:36:40,744
- Good for you.
- Me, the littleman?

1902
01:36:40,944 --> 01:36:41,984
Let me tell you something.

1903
01:36:42,145 --> 01:36:43,925
Let me tell you something else.

1904
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:46,219
Honestly, I'm not
bullshitting here,

1905
01:36:46,418 --> 01:36:48,234
this is one of the nicest
boat that I've ever been on.

1906
01:36:48,354 --> 01:36:50,041
- I gotta..I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

1907
01:36:50,042 --> 01:36:51,042
And, you know what I
was just thinking too.

1908
01:36:51,242 --> 01:36:53,831
The fucking hero that I'm
gonna be back at the office.

1909
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:56,934
When the bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

1910
01:36:57,134 --> 01:36:59,153
B'cos, I'm gonna
finally fuck Jordan.

1911
01:37:00,987 --> 01:37:02,009
It's beautiful.

1912
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,208
And, you get the beautiful
girls and everything.

1913
01:37:03,479 --> 01:37:04,726
It's wonderful.

1914
01:37:04,926 --> 01:37:07,064
Alright, get the
fuck off my boat.

1915
01:37:07,264 --> 01:37:09,881
I'm sure we'll be seeing each
other, real soon. - I'm sure.

1916
01:37:10,082 --> 01:37:13,559
Good luck on that subway ride home to
your miserable ugly fucking wives.

1917
01:37:13,759 --> 01:37:16,878
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some caviar
off my balls. In the meantime.

1918
01:37:17,078 --> 01:37:19,731
Hey, you guys wanna take some
lobsters for your ride home?

1919
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:21,880
You fucking miserable pricks!
I know you can't afford them.

1920
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:24,064
Fucking cheap fucks.

1921
01:37:24,265 --> 01:37:25,265
Fucking miserable pricks!

1922
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:29,639
Hey, fellas..look what I
found in my pockets. Look!

1923
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:31,953
Your year salary, right here.

1924
01:37:32,153 --> 01:37:33,193
You know what I call them?

1925
01:37:33,353 --> 01:37:34,353
Fun coupons.

1926
01:37:35,965 --> 01:37:38,792
A fun coupons.

1927
01:37:46,563 --> 01:37:49,186
Switzerland? What the
fuck is in Switzerland?

1928
01:37:49,399 --> 01:37:50,720
Swiss fucking
Banks, that's what.

1929
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:54,180
It was ass covering time.
I had to hide my money.

1930
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:56,340
Enter Rugrat.

1931
01:37:56,989 --> 01:37:59,159
He knew Swiss Banker
from law school.

1932
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:00,359
But, he was in Geneva.

1933
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,684
And there was no way, I'm
gonna make that flight sober.

1934
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:08,896
So, I knew if I took my drugs right. I
could sleep through the entire flight.

1935
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:11,300
But, I had to take
'em, JUST RIGHT.

1936
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:14,548
At 4 pm I popped a
few more ludes.

1937
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:17,551
Which started kicking in by the
time I finished my sales meeting.

1938
01:38:17,752 --> 01:38:18,752
My tingle phase.

1939
01:38:19,689 --> 01:38:21,288
By dinner I popped a few more

1940
01:38:21,488 --> 01:38:23,948
on top of some cocktails
and a valium or two.

1941
01:38:24,149 --> 01:38:26,207
My slur phase.

1942
01:38:28,457 --> 01:38:30,462
By eight thirty, I
popped a few more ludes.

1943
01:38:30,662 --> 01:38:32,640
And pretty much lost
my motor skills.

1944
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:35,345
This was the drool phase.

1945
01:38:38,511 --> 01:38:40,800
By ten I didn't know who
or what the fuck I was...

1946
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,609
The amnesia phase.

1947
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,569
We boarded the plane,
just before midnight.

1948
01:38:45,939 --> 01:38:49,162
Wow! Look at you.
You're all beautiful.

1949
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:55,109
- May I see your boarding passes
Sir. - We have boarding passes.

1950
01:39:04,201 --> 01:39:05,849
He's got his hand
on my dick again.

1951
01:39:09,289 --> 01:39:10,439
Oh, my God! Take it off.

1952
01:39:12,088 --> 01:39:12,855
Take it off.

1953
01:39:13,121 --> 01:39:15,104
I heard there's a
treasure map, under here.

1954
01:39:15,699 --> 01:39:16,670
Stop.

1955
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:19,579
Please, sit down.

1956
01:39:19,779 --> 01:39:21,588
Go back to your seat, please.

1957
01:39:21,788 --> 01:39:23,523
Please, go back to your seat.

1958
01:39:23,722 --> 01:39:25,609
I will have to call the captain.

1959
01:39:25,809 --> 01:39:27,844
Please, Sir. Please sit down.

1960
01:39:28,043 --> 01:39:29,043
Please sit down!

1961
01:39:29,243 --> 01:39:30,243
Okay, I'm going.

1962
01:39:31,784 --> 01:39:32,975
Okay..okay.

1963
01:39:35,057 --> 01:39:36,466
Fasten your seatbelt please.

1964
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:39,275
We cannot take off, if you
haven't fasten your seatbelt.

1965
01:39:39,475 --> 01:39:40,475
Sit down, fasten it.

1966
01:39:40,676 --> 01:39:42,690
- I will do it for you.
- What?

1967
01:39:42,890 --> 01:39:43,890
I will do it for you.

1968
01:39:44,091 --> 01:39:46,655
You gotta speak English We don't
understand Swiss language.

1969
01:40:13,858 --> 01:40:14,905
Christ. Fuck.

1970
01:40:17,716 --> 01:40:18,668
Donnie.

1971
01:40:18,868 --> 01:40:21,926
Donnie, this isn't
funny, untie me, buddy.

1972
01:40:22,127 --> 01:40:23,904
I can't tie you.

1973
01:40:24,104 --> 01:40:25,796
The captain tied you.

1974
01:40:25,996 --> 01:40:27,036
He was fucking tasing you.

1975
01:40:28,649 --> 01:40:29,752
Why?

1976
01:40:29,953 --> 01:40:30,953
Why?

1977
01:40:45,189 --> 01:40:46,384
You're screaming at people.

1978
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:47,583
Fuck off.

1979
01:40:47,783 --> 01:40:50,440
You were on the floor, like
rolling around and shit.

1980
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:52,586
You called the
captain the N-words.

1981
01:40:52,786 --> 01:40:55,117
I call the captain an N-words?

1982
01:40:55,317 --> 01:40:56,317
Yeah, he was very upset.

1983
01:40:56,516 --> 01:40:57,516
Really?

1984
01:40:57,716 --> 01:40:58,957
Luckily, we are in first class.

1985
01:41:01,024 --> 01:41:03,534
Jesus Christ, I think you
have a fucking drug problem.

1986
01:41:04,957 --> 01:41:06,149
Where are the ludes?

1987
01:41:06,350 --> 01:41:07,945
Where are the ludes?

1988
01:41:08,145 --> 01:41:10,280
They're in my ass,
don't worry about it.

1989
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:11,480
I got it.

1990
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:12,680
Thank God.

1991
01:41:13,905 --> 01:41:16,650
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do
when we get to Switzerland, buddy.

1992
01:41:16,652 --> 01:41:17,652
This is bad.

1993
01:41:17,851 --> 01:41:19,639
This fucking thing's pressing
my chest I can't breath.

1994
01:41:19,838 --> 01:41:20,838
Do something to calm
me down, please.

1995
01:41:21,038 --> 01:41:23,164
Okay, shut the fuck up.
Just shut the fuck up.

1996
01:41:23,364 --> 01:41:24,364
Help me.

1997
01:41:24,564 --> 01:41:25,564
Okay... shhh..shh..

1998
01:41:26,936 --> 01:41:28,648
- That's good.
- Go to sleep.

1999
01:41:28,847 --> 01:41:29,847
Rub it harder, buddy.

2000
01:41:30,047 --> 01:41:31,047
You're all right.

2001
01:41:31,247 --> 01:41:33,725
We all love you.
Shut the fuck up!

2002
01:41:39,733 --> 01:41:40,957
Mr. Belfort.

2003
01:41:41,157 --> 01:41:42,157
You're free to go.

2004
01:41:44,855 --> 01:41:46,143
Really?

2005
01:41:49,953 --> 01:41:50,793
- Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah.

2006
01:41:50,944 --> 01:41:52,546
When we get up there. Try not
to act like yourself, okay?

2007
01:41:52,746 --> 01:41:54,519
Let's make Geneva an asshole
free Donnie zone, alright?

2008
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:55,719
Why the fuck are you
coming at me for?

2009
01:41:55,949 --> 01:41:58,150
Hey, listen..the only reason
you're sitting in this limo

2010
01:41:58,247 --> 01:42:00,167
and not a Swiss jail is
b'cos of my friend, okay?

2011
01:42:02,233 --> 01:42:03,411
We are here. We are here.

2012
01:42:04,489 --> 01:42:05,659
Jordan Belfort!

2013
01:42:05,859 --> 01:42:06,859
At last!

2014
01:42:07,060 --> 01:42:09,565
Nicholas has told me so much.

2015
01:42:10,652 --> 01:42:12,171
Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel.

2016
01:42:12,372 --> 01:42:14,613
- Pleasure to make your
acquaintance. - Nice to meet you.

2017
01:42:22,619 --> 01:42:25,447
I'm curious about your
bank secrecy laws, here.

2018
01:42:29,622 --> 01:42:30,525
Excusez-moi, Jordan,

2019
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:35,220
Swiss custom requires ten
minutes of blah blah blah..

2020
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:36,420
Chit chat. Chit chat!
Thank you.

2021
01:42:36,619 --> 01:42:38,717
Before business
can be discussed.

2022
01:42:44,266 --> 01:42:46,876
Of course, let's
get down to it.”

2023
01:42:47,076 --> 01:42:48,197
What would you like to know?

2024
01:42:49,474 --> 01:42:51,429
Under what circumstances
would you be..

2025
01:42:51,628 --> 01:42:53,903
...obligated to
cooperate with an FBI

2026
01:42:54,103 --> 01:42:57,917
or U.S. Justice Department
investigation? For example.

2027
01:42:58,118 --> 01:42:59,118
<i>Ca depend.</i>

2028
01:43:00,493 --> 01:43:02,505
<i>- Ca depend?
- Oui.</i>

2029
01:43:03,753 --> 01:43:05,898
<i>Ca depend </i>on what? Exactly.

2030
01:43:07,086 --> 01:43:09,984
Whether America plans to invade
Switzerland in the coming months.

2031
01:43:11,304 --> 01:43:13,529
So, check if tanks are rolling
down the Rue de la Croix?

2032
01:43:13,529 --> 01:43:14,630
Yes, <i>Rue de la Croix</i>.

2033
01:43:30,457 --> 01:43:35,042
<i>What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,
is are you going to fuck me over.</i>

2034
01:43:38,055 --> 01:43:41,760
<i>I understand perfectly,
you American shitheel.</i>

2035
01:43:43,909 --> 01:43:46,829
The only way the Banque Real
de Geneve would cooperate;

2036
01:43:47,029 --> 01:43:48,029
With a foreign legal body

2037
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:52,269
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.

2038
01:43:52,539 --> 01:43:56,981
But, there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

2039
01:43:57,181 --> 01:43:59,721
From a financial standpoint,

2040
01:43:59,921 --> 01:44:02,783
you are now in heaven.

2041
01:44:02,984 --> 01:44:05,046
See, I told you he's
fantastic, right?

2042
01:44:05,470 --> 01:44:08,697
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena,

2043
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,747
it would become
<i> papier-toillette</i>.

2044
01:44:13,591 --> 01:44:15,422
We would wipe our ass with it.

2045
01:44:15,622 --> 01:44:16,622
Unless, of course..

2046
01:44:16,823 --> 01:44:20,063
It was an investigation
into stock fraud..

2047
01:44:20,262 --> 01:44:23,192
Which is a crime in Switzerland.
If I'm correct.

2048
01:44:23,391 --> 01:44:26,546
Then, there'd have
to be Cooperacion.

2049
01:44:26,747 --> 01:44:28,068
On your part, If
I'm not mistaken.

2050
01:44:29,399 --> 01:44:30,260
Yes, we would.

2051
01:44:31,579 --> 01:44:34,354
Assuming the account
is under your name.

2052
01:44:36,067 --> 01:44:37,234
If it were..

2053
01:44:37,434 --> 01:44:38,434
Another name..

2054
01:44:40,086 --> 01:44:42,550
A friends, Comerate, Cousin..

2055
01:44:47,811 --> 01:44:49,243
Relatives? Yeah.

2056
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:53,930
Was that yodeling
I just heard or

2057
01:44:54,131 --> 01:44:56,145
did you just say what
I thought you said?

2058
01:44:56,345 --> 01:44:58,628
Yes! Yes!

2059
01:44:58,828 --> 01:45:01,652
He's telling me
to use a rathole.

2060
01:45:01,851 --> 01:45:05,594
But, a U.S. rathole would never get
into Switzerland with all that money.

2061
01:45:05,793 --> 01:45:09,967
What I needed was a ratholr
with a European passport.

2062
01:45:17,384 --> 01:45:18,658
Jordan?

2063
01:45:18,859 --> 01:45:21,734
Hey! How is my
favourite Aunt, huh?

2064
01:45:21,935 --> 01:45:24,418
- Welcome, was the traffic
terrible? - No, not at all.

2065
01:45:29,029 --> 01:45:31,359
Thank God, Aunt Emma didn't
need too much convincing.

2066
01:45:31,725 --> 01:45:34,349
Turned out, the British weren't too
much different from the Swiss.

2067
01:45:34,350 --> 01:45:37,402
Money talks. And,
bullshit takes the bus.

2068
01:45:37,601 --> 01:45:39,766
How do you say
'rathole' in British.

2069
01:45:39,966 --> 01:45:42,186
If you get in any
trouble, whatsoever.

2070
01:45:42,386 --> 01:45:45,154
I'll come forward immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

2071
01:45:45,354 --> 01:45:46,354
That I promise.

2072
01:45:47,783 --> 01:45:50,324
Risk is what keeps us
young, isn't it darling?

2073
01:45:54,657 --> 01:45:56,211
Sometimes, I wonder

2074
01:45:56,411 --> 01:45:59,033
if you let money get the
best of you, my love.

2075
01:45:59,234 --> 01:46:02,743
Among other substances.

2076
01:46:07,065 --> 01:46:09,023
It's that obvious, huh?

2077
01:46:09,222 --> 01:46:11,591
It's chilly darling and
you're sweating bullets.

2078
01:46:14,850 --> 01:46:18,353
What can I say, Aunt Emma.
I'm a drug addict.

2079
01:46:19,548 --> 01:46:22,172
I really am. I mean,
Cocaine, pills..

2080
01:46:23,912 --> 01:46:25,908
Whatever it is,
I'll fucking do it.

2081
01:46:26,108 --> 01:46:28,212
That's the truth.

2082
01:46:28,412 --> 01:46:31,194
I am a sex addict too.

2083
01:46:31,394 --> 01:46:34,702
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

2084
01:46:36,032 --> 01:46:37,752
Jesus, why am I
telling you all this?

2085
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,952
I am sorry.

2086
01:46:40,984 --> 01:46:42,877
Because I'm very
easy to talk to.

2087
01:46:43,078 --> 01:46:44,078
You are.

2088
01:46:44,278 --> 01:46:46,208
You are easy to talk to.

2089
01:46:46,408 --> 01:46:47,408
I suppose it's..

2090
01:46:49,465 --> 01:46:51,033
It's just my job, you
know, it's uh...

2091
01:46:51,234 --> 01:46:55,407
All these people depending on me, tens of
millions of dollars at stake, you know,

2092
01:46:55,606 --> 01:46:57,372
Sometimes, I feel like I..

2093
01:46:57,572 --> 01:47:00,600
I've bitten on more than
I can chew, you know?

2094
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:03,344
You're a man with
large appetites.

2095
01:47:03,543 --> 01:47:04,543
Yeah.

2096
01:47:07,054 --> 01:47:08,949
Is she, fucking hitting on me?

2097
01:47:09,149 --> 01:47:10,149
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

2098
01:47:13,936 --> 01:47:16,856
I suppose, I put that on
myself though, right?

2099
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:18,056
My decision.

2100
01:47:18,256 --> 01:47:20,515
It's hard to..

2101
01:47:20,716 --> 01:47:21,716
Hard to learn to..

2102
01:47:21,916 --> 01:47:24,988
To control the anxiety
sometimes, you know?

2103
01:47:27,145 --> 01:47:29,823
Learn to relax, and let go.

2104
01:47:31,181 --> 01:47:32,990
To release the tension.

2105
01:47:34,318 --> 01:47:36,024
She is hitting on me.

2106
01:47:36,225 --> 01:47:37,225
Holy shit!

2107
01:47:37,425 --> 01:47:39,751
Yeah, release the tension.

2108
01:47:44,489 --> 01:47:48,832
Suppose we, uh.. We all
just need to learn not..

2109
01:47:49,032 --> 01:47:51,935
Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?

2110
01:47:54,993 --> 01:47:57,088
Is he fucking hitting on me?

2111
01:48:03,668 --> 01:48:04,997
Stability, dear.

2112
01:48:05,197 --> 01:48:06,197
Family.

2113
01:48:13,475 --> 01:48:14,954
You take care of
my nice, my love.

2114
01:48:15,154 --> 01:48:17,344
I'll take care of
everything, over here.

2115
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:20,480
Deal.

2116
01:48:26,329 --> 01:48:30,005
We had, literally, a
fuck load of money.

2117
01:48:30,204 --> 01:48:33,051
Aunt Emma, could never
carry all this by herself.

2118
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:37,210
So, I thought to myself, who
else has European passport?

2119
01:48:38,859 --> 01:48:42,204
Now, Brad, as a
successful drug dealer,

2120
01:48:42,752 --> 01:48:44,886
spent his winters in
the south of France,

2121
01:48:44,886 --> 01:48:46,887
which is where he met
his wife, Chantelle.

2122
01:48:46,889 --> 01:48:49,890
A striper of Slovenian origin,

2123
01:48:49,891 --> 01:48:53,725
born in, of all
places, Switzerland.

2124
01:48:57,832 --> 01:48:59,833
Well, this is fucked.

2125
01:48:59,835 --> 01:49:01,802
Oh, no, shit!

2126
01:49:05,006 --> 01:49:08,943
- Like this will take a,
like, 50 trips. - I know.

2127
01:49:12,814 --> 01:49:13,872
Yeah, a suicide work.

2128
01:49:13,948 --> 01:49:16,850
But, how about her family?
Right?

2129
01:49:16,851 --> 01:49:18,987
I mean, they all got
Swiss' passport, right?

2130
01:49:18,988 --> 01:49:20,954
I mean, she's got parents,
she's got a brother.

2131
01:49:20,956 --> 01:49:23,757
Right, brother's got a wife,
that's five fuckin' people.

2132
01:49:23,759 --> 01:49:25,760
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2133
01:49:25,761 --> 01:49:27,996
They're all fuckin' Swiss and it was like,
"what are you doing?", they could do that.

2134
01:49:27,997 --> 01:49:30,864
At least I have a family,
you crooked nose fuck!

2135
01:49:30,865 --> 01:49:33,926
Hey, hey, uh, don't
forget about my money.

2136
01:49:35,635 --> 01:49:37,805
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Hey, I forgot to tell you

2137
01:49:37,806 --> 01:49:40,841
- he's got some, he's got
some money. - My money.

2138
01:49:40,842 --> 01:49:42,944
- Yeah, a couple mill comin'
in like a week. - Yeah.

2139
01:49:42,944 --> 01:49:45,505
And when it gets here, I'll give
you a call, you come pick it up.

2140
01:49:48,016 --> 01:49:49,814
You give me a call?

2141
01:49:50,985 --> 01:49:54,823
When it gets here, I'll give you
a call, and you come pick it up.

2142
01:49:54,823 --> 01:49:56,757
Well, we don't fuckin'
work for you, man!

2143
01:49:56,759 --> 01:49:57,024
Shh..

2144
01:49:57,025 --> 01:49:59,927
Sweetheart, you have my
money taped to your tits.

2145
01:49:59,929 --> 01:50:01,896
Okay? Technically
you do work for me.

2146
01:50:04,934 --> 01:50:06,768
Hey, Jordan, we're
gonna need to talk.

2147
01:50:06,769 --> 01:50:09,002
If I fuckin' do this, I'm telling you
right now, I ain't goin' to him.

2148
01:50:09,003 --> 01:50:11,939
Okay? I'm not a fuckin' schwas, I
don't do fuckin' pick-ups, alright?

2149
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:13,841
- But listen to me, when this thing placed,
- I'm gonna take care of everything.

2150
01:50:13,842 --> 01:50:15,909
And I fuckin' say, and you tell
that fuckin' piece of shit.

2151
01:50:15,911 --> 01:50:17,011
- If he comes correct.
- I will.

2152
01:50:17,011 --> 01:50:19,395
If he comes in, I'll fuckin'
loopy and fucked up. I

2153
01:50:19,396 --> 01:50:21,815
swear to God, I'm a mash
that douchebag's teeth.

2154
01:50:21,817 --> 01:50:23,818
I hear that, who's
fucking cheating?

2155
01:50:23,819 --> 01:50:25,752
- Who's fuckin' cheating?!
- Look, may I asking..

2156
01:50:25,753 --> 01:50:27,921
I put the money on that
fuckin' table, not you!

2157
01:50:27,922 --> 01:50:29,858
I'm the reason we have
this fuckin' deal!

2158
01:50:29,859 --> 01:50:31,826
- I have a gun, you fucking
idiot! - What the fuck this gun.

2159
01:50:31,827 --> 01:50:32,926
I already told you this.

2160
01:50:32,927 --> 01:50:36,864
You know what? You're a fuckin' pill deal,
I got five more just like you, bro!

2161
01:50:36,865 --> 01:50:38,765
Keep talking, you piece of shit!

2162
01:50:38,766 --> 01:50:40,902
Do you know what? You
dress like shit!

2163
01:50:40,903 --> 01:50:42,936
- So, fuck you!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

2164
01:50:42,938 --> 01:50:45,773
- Jesus! - Like that
faggot. Who's the faggot?

2165
01:50:45,774 --> 01:50:46,875
- Enough with your shit!
- You okay?

2166
01:50:46,876 --> 01:50:47,842
Hey pal!

2167
01:50:49,944 --> 01:50:52,913
The next day, aunt
Emma flew to Geneve.

2168
01:50:52,914 --> 01:50:55,783
Two million in cash
in her carry on.

2169
01:50:55,783 --> 01:50:58,752
Which in a big picture was a
drop in the Swiss bucket.

2170
01:50:59,787 --> 01:51:02,890
'Cause the following month, over
the course of six roundtrips,

2171
01:51:02,891 --> 01:51:05,203
Chantelle's family and
friends smugglin'

2172
01:51:05,204 --> 01:51:07,929
over 20 millon in cash
without even a hiccup.

2173
01:51:07,930 --> 01:51:09,963
- Shred it.
- And by the way..

2174
01:51:09,965 --> 01:51:13,868
- Here they are.
- Excellent!

2175
01:51:13,868 --> 01:51:15,859
- And I have some more.
- Really?

2176
01:51:15,938 --> 01:51:16,970
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

2177
01:51:16,971 --> 01:51:18,939
- And here.
- Welcome.

2178
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:20,807
(LAUGHING) Welcome?

2179
01:51:20,809 --> 01:51:23,743
- And yeah, like four
bags of it. - Ooh.

2180
01:51:24,012 --> 01:51:26,847
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2181
01:51:26,849 --> 01:51:28,850
- Slovenian. Yes.
- Slovenian? Okay.

2182
01:51:28,850 --> 01:51:31,819
- So you're blonde?
- Oh, stop that.

2183
01:51:51,873 --> 01:51:52,840
Shit.

2184
01:51:52,841 --> 01:51:56,944
Put the fuckin' car
parked, you dumb idiot!

2185
01:51:56,945 --> 01:51:59,747
Yeah, close the briefcase.

2186
01:51:59,747 --> 01:52:02,817
One fuckin' day, one fuckin' day
you couldn't keep it together?

2187
01:52:02,818 --> 01:52:04,886
I was fucked up, Brad.

2188
01:52:04,886 --> 01:52:06,854
- You're fuckin' kidding me!
- Fucked up.

2189
01:52:12,327 --> 01:52:14,127
- It's a joke!
- It's a joke?

2190
01:52:14,128 --> 01:52:16,264
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

2191
01:52:16,265 --> 01:52:19,065
- It's a fuckin' joke. I'm not
stupid. - Are you fuckin' stupid?

2192
01:52:19,067 --> 01:52:20,301
- You fuckin' drivin' you like a
fuckin' maniac. - Do you know what..

2193
01:52:20,301 --> 01:52:22,475
- You know the attention
that fuckin' draws?

2194
01:52:22,475 --> 01:52:24,104
- You know what, I'm not stupid.

2195
01:52:24,105 --> 01:52:25,139
- I'm smart.
- Smart?

2196
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:27,207
- I make million dollar deal.
- That's right.

2197
01:52:27,208 --> 01:52:30,043
We smart important
people, unlike you.

2198
01:52:30,045 --> 01:52:33,310
People who don't sucker punch
people when they're scared, okay?

2199
01:52:33,891 --> 01:52:35,115
- I'm scared?
- And by the way,

2200
01:52:35,117 --> 01:52:37,251
- I haven't got an apology for
that. - One apology, okay.

2201
01:52:37,252 --> 01:52:39,153
I check my fuckin'
messages everyday

2202
01:52:39,154 --> 01:52:40,121
- when I come home from work.
- Did you?

2203
01:52:40,122 --> 01:52:41,122
- My answering machine.
- You didn't got one, huh?

2204
01:52:41,122 --> 01:52:43,256
Zero! I got a blinking light because
I don't have shit from you!

2205
01:52:43,257 --> 01:52:44,489
- Yeah right. You
know, you got a big

2206
01:52:44,490 --> 01:52:46,092
- fuckin' mouth!
- I got my wife, I got my wife

2207
01:52:46,094 --> 01:52:48,261
checking the messages every 45
minutes, calling the office say,

2208
01:52:48,262 --> 01:52:52,065
has Brad apologize? Is there any
apology message on the machine?

2209
01:52:52,067 --> 01:52:53,167
- Alright, do you know what..
- I don't have Jack shit.

2210
01:52:53,167 --> 01:52:54,653
- You know what? That's
not how you treat me.

2211
01:52:54,654 --> 01:52:56,170
- Yeah, you got a big
fuckin' mouth. You know

2212
01:52:56,171 --> 01:52:58,072
I'm not gonna give you a fuckin'
pass, just give me the case.

2213
01:52:58,073 --> 01:53:00,240
- Oh, you're not gonna give
me a pass? - Get out of here.

2214
01:53:00,242 --> 01:53:01,341
Look, it's a figure
fuckin' speech.

2215
01:53:01,342 --> 01:53:04,078
- Oh my God, the Emperor of Foxville.
- Just give me the fuckin' case

2216
01:53:04,078 --> 01:53:06,212
came down from Foxville
to give me a pass!

2217
01:53:06,213 --> 01:53:07,649
Hey, what are the
citizens of Foxville

2218
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:09,317
doing at the day when
the Emperor's gone?

2219
01:53:09,318 --> 01:53:11,319
- I'm begging you.
- Is it, is it mayhem?

2220
01:53:11,319 --> 01:53:13,220
Or people looting and raping?

2221
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:15,122
What all the little
fuckhead doing?

2222
01:53:15,122 --> 01:53:16,090
- Why are you here?
- You go fuck yourself!

2223
01:53:16,091 --> 01:53:18,158
- You fuckin', alright, alright.
- Hey, you fuck the back up!

2224
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:19,319
I'm fuckin' saying!

2225
01:53:20,028 --> 01:53:24,020
That if I ever cross you in my
life, if you come at me again,

2226
01:53:24,099 --> 01:53:25,265
- Just fuckin' keep it down.
- You know what?

2227
01:53:25,266 --> 01:53:31,238
I got it. I don't want to be avoiding
anything, but I think you like, like..

2228
01:53:31,238 --> 01:53:32,305
- Like, when you come at me,
- What the fuck?

2229
01:53:32,306 --> 01:53:34,207
- 'Cause you look at me.
- What's the matter with you?

2230
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:37,211
I just know I just noticed like,
you have like a fuckin', like..

2231
01:53:37,212 --> 01:53:38,212
- Stop that talk!
- You might twinkle.

2232
01:53:38,212 --> 01:53:41,082
You have like a twinkle, were
you trying to kiss me, bro?

2233
01:53:41,082 --> 01:53:42,216
- Jesus fuckin' Christ..
- Bro, you're trying..

2234
01:53:42,216 --> 01:53:44,737
- I'm.. What's with you? - I have
like a, I don't know, I just..

2235
01:53:45,052 --> 01:53:46,252
- I said that homophobic
thing.. - Baiklah.

2236
01:53:46,253 --> 01:53:48,189
- You're just not the one
for me, pal. - Okay.

2237
01:53:48,189 --> 01:53:51,125
You know what I mean? It's not, it's
not about that for me, you know?

2238
01:53:51,126 --> 01:53:52,259
- You understand?
- I've heard enough, please.

2239
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:54,127
I'm begging, give me
the fuckin' case.

2240
01:53:54,128 --> 01:53:55,128
- Okay?
- I gonna give you the case.

2241
01:53:55,130 --> 01:53:57,097
- Gve me the case. What's that?
- You gotta do me one favour.

2242
01:53:57,099 --> 01:53:58,265
You gotta take this case,

2243
01:53:58,265 --> 01:54:00,201
you gotta drive straight
home, you know.

2244
01:54:00,202 --> 01:54:02,036
I need you to open
up the briefcase,

2245
01:54:02,037 --> 01:54:06,073
and you take out every single dollar, don't
leave one dollar inside the briefcase.

2246
01:54:06,073 --> 01:54:09,076
I want you to have it all neatly
organized outside the briefcase,

2247
01:54:09,077 --> 01:54:10,176
and you to take it,

2248
01:54:10,177 --> 01:54:13,279
I need you to shove it right up your
wife's Slatvian cunt, you understand?

2249
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,248
- My fuckin' wife?
- Fuckin' chill!

2250
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:17,150
- (GROANING) Chill, bro! - You
motherfuckin' piece of shit!

2251
01:54:17,152 --> 01:54:19,153
- How about that?
- Let go, let go! Come on. Fuck!

2252
01:54:19,154 --> 01:54:21,122
(SIREN)

2253
01:54:21,189 --> 01:54:23,056
Motherfucker! You fuckin' dick!

2254
01:54:23,057 --> 01:54:26,060
Stop! Don't move! Don't move, I'm
gonna fire your fuckin' leg!

2255
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:28,095
I'm gonna fire you
in your fuckin' leg!

2256
01:54:28,095 --> 01:54:30,197
Drop the case, put
your hands in the air!

2257
01:54:30,198 --> 01:54:31,131
Get that!

2258
01:54:31,132 --> 01:54:32,099
(SCREAMING)

2259
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:34,268
Get on your knees, Sir!
Get down on your knees!

2260
01:54:34,269 --> 01:54:36,302
Motherfucker!

2261
01:54:36,304 --> 01:54:38,104
Fuck! Jesus!

2262
01:54:38,105 --> 01:54:39,265
Mother fucker!

2263
01:54:48,115 --> 01:54:49,115
Jordan!

2264
01:54:49,117 --> 01:54:52,018
Do I have a surprise for you.

2265
01:54:52,287 --> 01:54:54,186
20 real lemons.

2266
01:54:54,256 --> 01:54:56,936
Retired pharmacist friend of mine,
it been in his safe for 15 years.

2267
01:54:57,059 --> 01:54:58,324
You fuckin' kiddin' me? Lemons?

2268
01:54:58,326 --> 01:55:01,328
- (LAUGHING) - They're gonna knock
us out off our fuckin' head.

2269
01:55:01,328 --> 01:55:06,300
When it comes to quaalude, the
lemon 714 was the holygrail.

2270
01:55:06,301 --> 01:55:08,135
- Can you believe it?
- Oh my God..

2271
01:55:08,136 --> 01:55:09,136
I thought they were like a myth.

2272
01:55:09,136 --> 01:55:12,038
Three times as powerful as
anything available today.

2273
01:55:12,039 --> 01:55:15,275
- Look at these babies. - Boy Donnie
really knew how to celebrate.

2274
01:55:15,277 --> 01:55:17,600
He said he was saving
these for a special

2275
01:55:17,601 --> 01:55:20,180
occasion, like a birthday,
or being clapfree.

2276
01:55:20,181 --> 01:55:22,182
Or, my money arriving
safely in Switzerland.

2277
01:55:22,184 --> 01:55:23,317
We're gonna die!

2278
01:55:23,318 --> 01:55:26,319
(PUKE)

2279
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:29,090
So that night, I
cleared my schedule,

2280
01:55:29,091 --> 01:55:33,159
and I rid my body of anything
that could fuck with my high.

2281
01:55:33,161 --> 01:55:35,261
It was celebration time.

2282
01:55:35,262 --> 01:55:37,064
Okay.

2283
01:55:37,064 --> 01:55:38,198
We start off with one,
see how it'll go?

2284
01:55:38,199 --> 01:55:40,167
My guy says all we need is one.

2285
01:55:40,167 --> 01:55:41,100
Here we go.

2286
01:55:42,237 --> 01:55:44,137
- Salute.
- Cheers.

2287
01:55:44,139 --> 01:55:47,073
Maybe if I pull it
again, it will go down.

2288
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:51,045
Steve, Steve! I gotta
get outta here.

2289
01:55:51,046 --> 01:55:53,146
No! I think I got
it figured out.

2290
01:55:53,148 --> 01:55:57,118
It must be one pull for up,
and two pull for down.

2291
01:55:57,118 --> 01:55:58,143
Okay.

2292
01:56:06,293 --> 01:56:08,091
You feel anything?

2293
01:56:11,166 --> 01:56:13,030
No.

2294
01:56:15,103 --> 01:56:17,037
Been thirty five minutes.

2295
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:23,041
Maybe we built up a tolerance
after all these years, huh?

2296
01:56:24,345 --> 01:56:26,109
Hm..

2297
01:56:36,123 --> 01:56:37,224
This is bullshit!

2298
01:56:37,225 --> 01:56:40,327
My metabolism is pumped
out, I can't feel shit!

2299
01:56:40,328 --> 01:56:43,163
They're old, I think
they lost the potency?

2300
01:56:43,164 --> 01:56:44,131
Huh?

2301
01:56:44,198 --> 01:56:45,222
Check the bottle!

2302
01:56:49,037 --> 01:56:50,203
January '81.

2303
01:56:50,204 --> 01:56:51,238
They're fuckin' duds.

2304
01:56:51,238 --> 01:56:53,306
- Fuck!
- Let's take a..

2305
01:56:53,307 --> 01:56:55,275
- Take two more each.
- Yeah.

2306
01:56:57,179 --> 01:56:59,078
Jordan!

2307
01:56:59,079 --> 01:57:00,137
You're up, babe?

2308
01:57:03,217 --> 01:57:05,118
What are you two retards doing?

2309
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:06,177
We're workin' out, honey.

2310
01:57:07,122 --> 01:57:09,055
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2311
01:57:09,056 --> 01:57:11,184
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

2312
01:57:13,127 --> 01:57:14,161
Hey! Bo, what's going on?

2313
01:57:14,162 --> 01:57:16,063
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2314
01:57:16,064 --> 01:57:18,198
I can not talk to you in this
phone, and I have to talk with you.

2315
01:57:18,199 --> 01:57:20,067
We're gonna get outta here.
What's going on?

2316
01:57:20,068 --> 01:57:23,237
Listen to me, leave the
fuckin' house, Jordan!

2317
01:57:23,238 --> 01:57:27,140
And then call me from a payphone.
This is not a fuckin' joke, Jordan.

2318
01:57:27,141 --> 01:57:28,234
Yeah, yeah. Ya.

2319
01:57:29,243 --> 01:57:31,145
- Shit!
- What's.. What he said?

2320
01:57:31,145 --> 01:57:33,079
I don't know what the fuck
is going on, I gotta go!

2321
01:57:33,081 --> 01:57:34,162
Is everything okay, Jordan?

2322
01:57:44,292 --> 01:57:49,229
The closest payphone I can get to
is at the Brookvile Contry Club.

2323
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:51,231
It was a real WASP stronghold.

2324
01:57:51,233 --> 01:57:54,030
Just a mile down the
road from my house.

2325
01:58:03,469 --> 01:58:05,069
Hey Bo, what's up?
It's me, what's going

2326
01:58:05,070 --> 01:58:06,180
on? I'm at the payphone,
what's going on?

2327
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:07,148
Listen to me carefully.

2328
01:58:07,215 --> 01:58:10,117
Please, your little friend
here, Brad, your little buddy,

2329
01:58:10,118 --> 01:58:11,217
he's in jail.

2330
01:58:11,219 --> 01:58:13,287
He.. What the fuck he's in
jail for? What did he do?

2331
01:58:13,287 --> 01:58:14,320
I don't know what he did.

2332
01:58:14,322 --> 01:58:18,259
My friend in Long Island told me he got
picked up in some fuckin' shopping mall,

2333
01:58:18,260 --> 01:58:21,286
- he got locked up.. - Wait,
did you say a shopping mall?

2334
01:58:21,658 --> 01:58:23,162
- Yeah, yeah.
- He, he was with Donnie

2335
01:58:23,163 --> 01:58:26,166
he was supposed to deliver some money,
and that fuckin' fat piece of shit.

2336
01:58:26,167 --> 01:58:28,068
- I'm gonna go and fuckin' kill him. -
Jordan, Jordan, Jordan. Listen to me!

2337
01:58:28,069 --> 01:58:29,235
Don't go! Listen to me.

2338
01:58:29,237 --> 01:58:32,105
That guy, Denham,
that FBI agent guy,

2339
01:58:32,106 --> 01:58:36,109
somebody told me, he's got your phone
tapped. Your ofice and your home.

2340
01:58:36,110 --> 01:58:39,171
- Don't talk on that motherfuckin'
phone! - Okay. Fuck! I got it, I got it.

2341
01:58:39,247 --> 01:58:40,213
I got it, I got it.

2342
01:58:40,215 --> 01:58:42,115
Jordan.

2343
01:58:42,117 --> 01:58:45,319
You didn't try to bribe this
fuckin' FBI agent, did you?

2344
01:58:45,319 --> 01:58:48,087
No, I didn't try to
bribe that FBI agent.

2345
01:58:48,088 --> 01:58:49,256
You think I'm that
fuckin'stupid? No!

2346
01:58:49,256 --> 01:58:51,257
What the fuck you said?
I can't understand.

2347
01:58:51,259 --> 01:58:52,292
Say that again!

2348
01:58:52,293 --> 01:58:56,130
I said I won't, I know what my
feeling with this FBI agent.

2349
01:58:56,131 --> 01:58:57,291
What the fuck are you saying?

2350
01:58:59,167 --> 01:59:01,167
- I said..
- Are you fuckin' high?

2351
01:59:01,168 --> 01:59:04,070
Are you kidding me? I
don't wanna see more FBI!

2352
01:59:04,072 --> 01:59:06,233
Jordan! Are you fuckin' high?

2353
01:59:07,175 --> 01:59:09,275
Jordan, do me a favour.
Stay where you are,

2354
01:59:09,277 --> 01:59:11,145
don't get behind the
wheel of the car,

2355
01:59:11,145 --> 01:59:12,747
I'll be there in a
moment to pick you up.

2356
01:59:13,047 --> 01:59:13,648
Jordan, Jordan!

2357
01:59:14,048 --> 01:59:16,182
After 15 years in storage,

2358
01:59:16,184 --> 01:59:20,018
the lemons had developed
a delayed fuse.

2359
01:59:20,087 --> 01:59:23,319
It took 90 minutes for this little
fuckers to kick in, but once they did..

2360
01:59:24,059 --> 01:59:25,158
Pow!

2361
01:59:25,159 --> 01:59:28,328
I mean, I'd skipped the tingle phase
and went straight to the drool phase.

2362
01:59:28,329 --> 01:59:30,197
Tell me where you
are, don't fuckin'..

2363
01:59:30,198 --> 01:59:35,101
This little bastard was so strong,
I discovered a whole new phase.

2364
01:59:35,103 --> 01:59:37,264
The cerebral palsy phase.

2365
01:59:39,207 --> 01:59:41,175
Come on, stand up.

2366
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:47,238
Oke, walking's out.

2367
01:59:48,216 --> 01:59:51,048
I think, think what
else is there?

2368
01:59:52,087 --> 01:59:53,087
Yes!

2369
01:59:53,087 --> 01:59:56,056
I can crawl, I can
crawl like Skylar.

2370
02:00:27,188 --> 02:00:28,154
Fuck!

2371
02:00:28,155 --> 02:00:30,180
The kid makes it look
so goddamn easy.

2372
02:00:37,198 --> 02:00:39,131
Think, you motherfucker, think.

2373
02:00:39,333 --> 02:00:40,301
Yes!

2374
02:00:41,168 --> 02:00:42,235
I got it!

2375
02:00:42,237 --> 02:00:43,225
I've got it!

2376
02:00:43,304 --> 02:00:45,072
I can roll.

2377
02:00:45,073 --> 02:00:46,096
I can roll!

2378
02:00:55,315 --> 02:00:58,251

2379

(SHOUTING)

2383
02:02:08,155 --> 02:02:09,145
Jordan?

2384
02:02:11,126 --> 02:02:12,092
Jordan?

2385
02:02:12,327 --> 02:02:14,228
Oh Jesus. Where are you?

2386
02:02:14,229 --> 02:02:16,162
I'm at the Country Club.

2387
02:02:16,163 --> 02:02:17,131
What?

2388
02:02:17,131 --> 02:02:20,234
I'm at the Country Club!

2389
02:02:20,234 --> 02:02:23,036
I don't know what the fuck are you
saying, but you need to get home!

2390
02:02:23,037 --> 02:02:24,238
Donnie is out of control.

2391
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:27,106
He's on the other line
with some Swiss guy,

2392
02:02:27,108 --> 02:02:28,274
- I don't know..
- What?!

2393
02:02:28,275 --> 02:02:32,078
Get him off the phone!

2394
02:02:32,079 --> 02:02:34,314
I can't understand you.

2395
02:02:34,314 --> 02:02:38,085
Get him off the phone!

2396
02:02:38,086 --> 02:02:39,252
What the fuck are
you saying, Jordan?

2397
02:02:39,253 --> 02:02:41,154
Can you just get home? Hurry.

2398
02:02:41,155 --> 02:02:44,190
Oh my God!

2399
02:02:44,192 --> 02:02:46,182
Oh my God..

2400
02:02:51,099 --> 02:02:53,090
I was less than a
mile from home.

2401
02:02:53,167 --> 02:02:56,103
I drove as slow as
I fuckin' could.

2402
02:02:56,104 --> 02:02:57,237
I think Jello move faster.

2403
02:02:57,238 --> 02:03:00,306
I just couldn't give
him two million.

2404
02:03:00,307 --> 02:03:04,077
I'm gonna be a little late.

2405
02:03:04,078 --> 02:03:06,212
You ate two million?

2406
02:03:06,213 --> 02:03:07,314
Million!

2407
02:03:07,314 --> 02:03:10,250
Get off the phone, get off
the fuckin' phone, idiot!

2408
02:03:10,251 --> 02:03:13,220
- (CAR HORN)
- Get out of the way, asshole!

2409
02:03:13,287 --> 02:03:15,122
- Hello?
- Too late..

2410
02:03:15,122 --> 02:03:17,323
- And it's..
- You hate two million?

2411
02:03:17,324 --> 02:03:20,088
No, you don't hate
two million, Donnie.

2412
02:03:22,063 --> 02:03:25,064
By some miracle, I
made it home alive.

2413
02:03:25,065 --> 02:03:27,091
Not a scratch on me or the car.

2414
02:03:33,341 --> 02:03:36,275
Is that so?

2415
02:03:36,277 --> 02:03:38,110
Jordan?

2416
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:40,314
Oh Jesus fucking Christ!

2417
02:03:40,314 --> 02:03:42,282
What did you take?

2418
02:03:42,283 --> 02:03:43,306
What is wrong with you?

2419
02:03:44,051 --> 02:03:45,051
Jordan!

2420
02:03:45,052 --> 02:03:47,087
It's fuckin' good, right?

2421
02:03:47,087 --> 02:03:48,087
- What the fuck are you saying?
- You fucked up.

2422
02:03:48,088 --> 02:03:50,056
- What were you saying?
- Get off the phone!

2423
02:03:50,123 --> 02:03:55,095
Get off the fuckin' phone!

2424
02:03:55,095 --> 02:03:57,296
What the fuck, Jordan?

2425
02:03:57,297 --> 02:04:00,100
You're doing this in the
house, I hope you know that!

2426
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:02,101
You fucking doing

2427
02:04:02,103 --> 02:04:06,206
- You two are fucking funny
friends! - Get off the phone!

2428
02:04:06,207 --> 02:04:11,078
- Jesus, Jordan!
- The FBI!

2429
02:04:11,078 --> 02:04:14,180
- Get off the phone!
- I buy the phone!

2430
02:04:14,181 --> 02:04:18,318
Get off the phone!

2431
02:04:18,319 --> 02:04:23,086
- Give me the phone!
- (SCREAMING)

2432
02:04:23,157 --> 02:04:26,292
Come on. We're gonna
go upstairs, alright?

2433
02:04:26,293 --> 02:04:29,229
Get off the phone!

2434
02:04:33,268 --> 02:04:34,268
Fuck you!

2435
02:04:34,269 --> 02:04:36,302
- What's wrong?
- What you did?

2436
02:04:36,304 --> 02:04:38,305
- You piece of shit!

2437
02:04:38,305 --> 02:04:40,073

2438
02:04:40,073 --> 02:04:41,301
Brad!

2439
02:04:42,042 --> 02:04:43,109
Huh?!

2440
02:04:43,110 --> 02:04:45,112

2441
02:04:45,113 --> 02:04:46,179
Brad!

2442
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:49,248
You fuckin' asshole!

2443
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:53,119
Gimme the phone.

2444
02:04:53,121 --> 02:04:55,122
What did you do?

2445
02:04:55,122 --> 02:04:56,189
You piece of shit!

2446
02:04:56,189 --> 02:04:59,292
- What the fuck I did wrong?
- Fuck you!

2447
02:04:59,293 --> 02:05:02,095
I wanna fuckin' do it!

2448
02:05:02,095 --> 02:05:05,097
I wanna fuckin' kill you!

2449
02:05:05,099 --> 02:05:07,033
I'll get you!

2450

What the fuck happen?

2451

Oh, shit!

Jordan? Jordan, are you alright?

2453
02:05:36,230 --> 02:05:38,994
Donnie? Donnie?!

2454
02:05:39,934 --> 02:05:40,967
Donnie is not breathing!

2455
02:05:40,969 --> 02:05:43,036
Oh, fuck! I don't
know what to do!

2456
02:05:43,037 --> 02:05:45,072
Jordan, I don't know what the
fuck to do, I can't help him!

2457
02:05:45,073 --> 02:05:46,233
What are we gonna do, Jordan?

2458
02:05:47,591 --> 02:05:49,176
Oh my God, I think
he's choked, Jordan.

2459
02:05:49,176 --> 02:05:50,176
Do something!

2460

You fuckin' kidding me?
Fuck you!

Well, get the fuck

2491
02:07:47,971 --> 02:07:50,197
- Let's go! Come on! Get up!
- I've been here all night.

2492
02:07:50,198 --> 02:07:51,965
- Let's go! - I've been
sitting here all night.

2493
02:07:51,966 --> 02:07:54,134
- What the fuck are you talkin'? -
Wait a minute, why you taking him?

2494
02:07:54,135 --> 02:07:55,167
- The fuck are you doing?
- Let's go!

2495
02:07:55,168 --> 02:07:56,136
Why you taking him?

2496
02:07:56,136 --> 02:07:57,237
- Tell him!
- We got no warn.

2497
02:07:57,238 --> 02:08:00,140
You just come up and
peep a house like this!

2498
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:01,108
- I'm just talkin'.. - Did you
drive your car that night.

2499
02:08:01,109 --> 02:08:02,974
Mr. Belfort?

2500
02:08:04,177 --> 02:08:06,009
Well.

2501
02:08:08,181 --> 02:08:10,046
Wow!

2502
02:08:10,118 --> 02:08:12,143
Maybe I hadn't
made at home okay.

2503
02:08:27,033 --> 02:08:29,935
Get out of the fuckin' way!

2504
02:08:31,204 --> 02:08:34,197
Fuck! Fucker!

2505
02:08:38,112 --> 02:08:40,146
Did you drive..

2506
02:08:40,148 --> 02:08:42,115
That car, tonight?

02:08:44,185 --> 02:08:45,118
Right.

I'm a family man. Family man.
Honey!

2510
02:08:49,023 --> 02:08:51,056
It was a miracle
I wasn't killed.

2511
02:08:51,057 --> 02:08:54,094
More, you know, that I
didn't kill anybody else.

2512
02:08:54,095 --> 02:08:57,130
The cops took me in for questioning,
but they couldn't charge ne.

2513
02:08:57,131 --> 02:09:00,065
They had no proof I was
even behind the wheel.

2514
02:09:00,067 --> 02:09:03,046
Meanwhile, Brad did three
months in jail for

2515
02:09:03,047 --> 02:09:06,038
contempt because he
wouldn't let Donnie out.

2516
02:09:06,039 --> 02:09:08,207
The result? I was Scot free.

2517
02:09:08,208 --> 02:09:11,043
But I had eyes on me
like never before.

2518
02:09:11,045 --> 02:09:12,979
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

2519
02:09:12,979 --> 02:09:15,005
You're lucky be alive,
let alone not in jail.

2520
02:09:15,777 --> 02:09:17,184
No, I don't believe
in luck, right?

2521
02:09:17,185 --> 02:09:19,019
But it's time.

2522
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:21,154
Please, let me call the
SEC and cut a deal,

2523
02:09:21,154 --> 02:09:23,155
before your luck runs out.

2524
02:09:23,157 --> 02:09:25,125
Wave to daddy!

2525
02:09:25,126 --> 02:09:28,161
Hey! Hey, sweetie.

2526
02:09:28,162 --> 02:09:30,229
- (LAUGHING)
- You're doing great, sweetie.

2527
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:32,998
You're doing so great.

2528
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,002
What kind of terms that we
do talking about, if I..

2529
02:09:36,002 --> 02:09:37,037
- You know..
- I don't know

2530
02:09:37,037 --> 02:09:40,207
you know you plead guilty to
handful of securities violation.

2531
02:09:40,207 --> 02:09:43,247
Stock manipulation,
high pressure sales

2532
02:09:43,247 --> 02:09:46,908
tactics, ticky-tack shit
like that, you know?

2533
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:48,113
Pay a couple million
dollars in fine,

2534
02:09:48,114 --> 02:09:51,050
in exchange, SEC fucks off
till the end of time.

2535
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:57,189
And Stratton, what
happen to Stratton?

2536
02:09:57,190 --> 02:09:59,091
I mean that you, there's
no way, I mean..

2537
02:09:59,092 --> 02:10:00,993
You gotta walk away, right?

2538
02:10:00,994 --> 02:10:03,122
- Let Donnie be in charge.
- Alright, Donnie.

2539
02:10:04,198 --> 02:10:06,233
And the FBI is another
animal, completely.

2540
02:10:06,234 --> 02:10:08,167
They still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.

2541
02:10:08,168 --> 02:10:11,002
However, with you stepping
down voluntarily,

2542
02:10:11,171 --> 02:10:13,121
my guess is, that your
best friend, agent Denham,

2543
02:10:13,122 --> 02:10:15,108
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand.

2544
02:10:17,011 --> 02:10:18,078
Jordan.

2545
02:10:18,078 --> 02:10:20,079
Wh.. What do you
have to think about?

2546
02:10:20,081 --> 02:10:22,015
Yo.. You beat them!

2547
02:10:22,015 --> 02:10:23,015
You won!

2548
02:10:23,016 --> 02:10:25,085
God knows you'll never
have to work again.

2549
02:10:25,086 --> 02:10:27,220
What you're gonna do? Spend the rest of
your life in jail? Is that what you want?

2550
02:10:27,220 --> 02:10:29,122
- No.
- Okay!

2551
02:10:29,122 --> 02:10:31,157
Okay. You got all the
money in the world.

2552
02:10:31,158 --> 02:10:33,025
You need everybody else's money?

2553
02:10:33,027 --> 02:10:34,226
- Of course not.
- Well?

2554
02:10:34,228 --> 02:10:37,029
- You know I built it.
- I know you built it!

2555
02:10:37,030 --> 02:10:39,123
You built it, so
now preserved it!

2556
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:48,032
(CLAPPING)

2557
02:11:09,997 --> 02:11:11,230
You know..

2558
02:11:11,231 --> 02:11:16,002
Five years ago, when I started
Stratton Oakmont with Donnie Azoff,

2559
02:11:16,002 --> 02:11:19,166
I knew the day would eventually come
where I'd have to be moving on.

2560
02:11:22,042 --> 02:11:25,136
And it's trully with a heavy
heart, that I'm here to say that..

2561
02:11:27,148 --> 02:11:29,181
That, that that day
is finally here.

2562
02:11:29,182 --> 02:11:32,050
(SHOCKED)

2563
02:11:33,988 --> 02:11:39,192
I wanna, I wanna thank you all for your
years of loyalty and admiration, but uh,

2564
02:11:39,193 --> 02:11:41,161
the point is this.

2565
02:11:41,162 --> 02:11:46,099
Under Donnie's keadership, along with
Nicky Koskoff and Robbie Feinberg,

2566
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:48,292
moving into key
management posisitions,

2567
02:11:48,293 --> 02:11:50,310
this place really
is, it's gonna be

2568
02:11:50,310 --> 02:11:52,903
better than ever. That
I promise you, okay?

2569
02:11:59,012 --> 02:12:01,146
This is Ellis
Island, you people.

2570
02:12:01,148 --> 02:12:02,617
Okay, who you are, or where you

2571
02:12:02,618 --> 02:12:06,019
from, where do your relatives came
over, from the fuckin' Mayflower,

2572
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:08,121
or the inner tube from Haiti.

2573
02:12:08,122 --> 02:12:13,059
This, right here, is the land of
opportunity, Stratton Oakmont, is America!

2574
02:12:13,060 --> 02:12:15,153
(CHEERING)

2575
02:12:17,030 --> 02:12:20,065
- All of you know Kimmie
Belzer, right? - Yes, we do.

2576
02:12:20,067 --> 02:12:21,931
Fuck you!

2577
02:12:22,002 --> 02:12:23,002
Come on, Kimmie.

2578
02:12:23,003 --> 02:12:24,203
Which you probably
didn't know is,

2579
02:12:24,204 --> 02:12:29,208
Kimmie was one of the first brokers here,
one of the Stratton's original 20.

2580
02:12:29,210 --> 02:12:32,094
And most of you met
Kimmie the beautiful

2581
02:12:32,095 --> 02:12:35,015
sophisticated woman
that she is today.

2582
02:12:35,015 --> 02:12:40,020
A woman that wears 3000
dollar Armani suits.

2583
02:12:40,020 --> 02:12:43,088
Drives brand new Mercedes Benz.

2584
02:12:43,090 --> 02:12:45,835
A woman who, who
spends her winters

2585
02:12:45,836 --> 02:12:49,051
in Bahamas and her
summers in Hamptons.

2586
02:12:53,967 --> 02:12:56,027
That's not the
Kimmie that I met.

2587
02:12:59,105 --> 02:13:03,042
The Kimmie that I met didn't have
two nickels to rub together.

2588
02:13:04,045 --> 02:13:08,148
She was a single mom on the balls of
her ass with an eight year old son.

2589
02:13:08,149 --> 02:13:11,140
Okay? She was three months
behind on her rent.

2590
02:13:12,153 --> 02:13:15,145
And when se came to me
and ask me for a job,

2591
02:13:16,056 --> 02:13:18,920
she asked for 5000
dollar advance just..

2592
02:13:18,921 --> 02:13:21,926
Just so she could pay
her son's tuition.

2593
02:13:26,067 --> 02:13:28,033
And what I do, Kimmie?

2594
02:13:28,034 --> 02:13:29,092
Go on, tell them.

2595
02:13:31,137 --> 02:13:33,206
You wrote me a check..

2596
02:13:33,207 --> 02:13:35,936
For 25.000 dollars.

2597
02:13:37,011 --> 02:13:38,211
That's right.

2598
02:13:38,212 --> 02:13:39,940
Thank you.

2599
02:13:43,083 --> 02:13:44,948
And you know why that is?

2600
02:13:48,154 --> 02:13:50,145
That's because I
believed in you.

2601
02:13:52,158 --> 02:13:54,217
It's because I believed
in you, Kimmie.

2602
02:13:55,229 --> 02:13:59,164
Just like I believe in each and
everyone of you here today.

2603
02:13:59,166 --> 02:14:02,969
- I fuckin' love you, Jordan. I fuckin'
love you. - I fuckin' love you.

2604
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:05,070
- I love you.
- I fuckin' love you too!

2605
02:14:05,072 --> 02:14:07,006
I fuckin' love you too!

2606
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:11,109
And I love all of you!

2607
02:14:12,046 --> 02:14:15,014
I love all of you, from
the bottom of my heart.

2608
02:14:15,015 --> 02:14:16,948
- I love you, Jordan!
- I mean it!

2609
02:14:27,027 --> 02:14:28,961
It's a shame, you know, 'cause..

2610
02:14:30,163 --> 02:14:34,100
For years I've been telling you guys,
never to take "no" for an answer, right?

2611
02:14:34,100 --> 02:14:38,971
In order to keep pushin' and
to never hang up the phone,

2612
02:14:38,972 --> 02:14:41,065
until you get what you want.

2613
02:14:42,042 --> 02:14:43,975
Because you all deserve it.

2614
02:14:45,212 --> 02:14:48,078
You know this fuckin' deal
that I'm about to sign..

2615
02:14:49,149 --> 02:14:53,109
Barring me from the securities
industry, barring me from Stratton..

2616
02:14:54,188 --> 02:14:55,951
My home..

2617
02:14:58,958 --> 02:15:01,051
The fuck is that? You know?

2618
02:15:02,061 --> 02:15:04,052
I tell you what it is. It's..

2619
02:15:05,032 --> 02:15:08,001
It's me taking "no" for
an answer, you know?

2620
02:15:09,170 --> 02:15:13,128
It's them, them selling me, not
the other way around. It's..

2621
02:15:14,975 --> 02:15:17,068
It's me being a
hypocrite, is what it is.

2622
02:15:22,949 --> 02:15:24,042
So..

2623
02:15:31,091 --> 02:15:32,182
You know what?

2624
02:15:36,197 --> 02:15:38,096
I'm not leaving.

2625
02:15:40,201 --> 02:15:41,963
I'm not leaving.

2626
02:15:44,171 --> 02:15:45,194
I'm not fucking leaving!

2627
02:15:45,939 --> 02:15:48,033
(CHEERING)

2628
02:15:54,215 --> 02:15:56,149
The show goes on.

2629
02:15:58,185 --> 02:16:00,052
This is my home.

2630
02:16:00,054 --> 02:16:05,082
They gonna need a fucking wrecking
ball to take me outta here!

2631
02:16:06,961 --> 02:16:11,096
They gonna need to send a national
guard or fucking SWAT team,

2632
02:16:11,097 --> 02:16:14,192
'cause I ain't going nowhere.

2633
02:16:20,039 --> 02:16:22,064
Fuck them!

2634
02:16:24,011 --> 02:16:28,072

02:16:55,976 --> 02:16:57,943
Jordan! Jordan!

2637
02:16:57,944 --> 02:16:59,104
Jordan, get back here!

2638
02:17:00,213 --> 02:17:01,181
Hey!

2639
02:17:04,084 --> 02:17:06,051
Give.. Give me that!

2640
02:17:08,055 --> 02:17:11,081
What a trouble in the
jungle, for Christ sake!

2641
02:17:12,993 --> 02:17:15,961
How did he, muffle truffle
you, huh, richman?

2642
02:17:15,962 --> 02:17:18,997
Turn the offer, trust Welch
on the order of SEC.

2643
02:17:18,998 --> 02:17:22,195
He is back in the
ocean, happy hunting.

2644
02:17:28,942 --> 02:17:31,934
(MUSIC)

2645
02:17:35,014 --> 02:17:37,115
It was our time to party big.

2646
02:17:37,117 --> 02:17:40,018
And just as Brad was
released from jail too.

2647
02:17:40,987 --> 02:17:44,218
I apologize, even offered to pay
him for his time in the can.

2648
02:17:45,158 --> 02:17:46,125
But he said no.

2649
02:17:46,126 --> 02:17:47,226
The day he was out,

2650
02:17:47,227 --> 02:17:49,194
he didn't want any part of us.

2651
02:17:49,195 --> 02:17:52,966
Sad thing was, two years later,

2652
02:17:52,967 --> 02:17:54,024
he was dead.

2653
02:17:54,234 --> 02:17:57,101
Massive heart attack, at 35.

2654
02:17:57,971 --> 02:17:59,940
Same age Mulshock died.

2655
02:18:00,106 --> 02:18:03,041
Not that they, have a hell
of a lot in common, but,

2656
02:18:03,176 --> 02:18:05,145
anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.

2657
02:18:08,147 --> 02:18:11,208
Within days, subpoena
started flying.

2658
02:18:11,951 --> 02:18:15,087
Notices to produce documents,
deposititions, you name it.

2659
02:18:15,088 --> 02:18:17,022
Donnie couldn't drink
water fast enough.

2660
02:18:17,023 --> 02:18:19,125
You now say it's coming
was to get me a subpoena.

2661
02:18:19,126 --> 02:18:21,245
Here's how we do a subpoena
to substracting our funds.

2662
02:18:28,968 --> 02:18:31,203
Fuck you USA, Fuck you!

2663
02:18:31,204 --> 02:18:33,172
Fuck you, Fuck you..

(CHEERING)

2665
02:18:43,016 --> 02:18:45,018
Jordan Belfort.

2666
02:18:45,019 --> 02:18:47,085
Olden, that's a nice name.

2667
02:18:47,086 --> 02:18:48,086
Thank you very much for that.

2668
02:18:48,087 --> 02:18:49,180
What kind a name is that?

2669
02:18:49,957 --> 02:18:50,989
That is my name.

2670
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:52,157
I do not recall that.

2671
02:18:52,158 --> 02:18:54,994
I do not recall that, okay?

2672
02:18:54,995 --> 02:18:57,095
Mr. Ming, thank you
for coming in today.

2673
02:18:57,096 --> 02:18:59,065
Is it okay if I
grab some Danish?

2674
02:18:59,066 --> 02:19:00,066
- Can I have a Danish?
- No, no, go.

2675
02:19:00,066 --> 02:19:01,968
They interogated everybody.

2676
02:19:01,968 --> 02:19:03,236
I got a low blood sugar,
that were I thinking.

2677
02:19:03,236 --> 02:19:08,207
I went on for months, it was
a total fucking harassment.

2678
02:19:08,208 --> 02:19:11,076
But not a single
Strattonite cracked.

2679
02:19:11,077 --> 02:19:13,179
Gladys Carrera.

2680
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:16,182
- Doesn't ring a bell. - Sorry, I
have no recomendation of that.

2681
02:19:16,183 --> 02:19:19,051

02:19:21,188 --> 02:19:24,122
Absolutely not.

2684
02:19:24,123 --> 02:19:25,195
By end of this, you

02:19:25,197 --> 02:19:26,757
I just thought you
might remember that.

2686
02:19:26,926 --> 02:19:28,227

2687
02:19:28,227 --> 02:19:29,802

2691
02:19:35,977 --> 02:19:38,004
review if you have
any memory of that.

2692
02:19:38,004 --> 02:19:39,560
Okey, you know we've
talked to several

2693
02:19:39,561 --> 02:19:41,404
of the employee at this
firm and nobody can

2694
02:19:41,405 --> 02:19:43,209
recall anything about
this thief t man IPO.

2695
02:19:43,209 --> 02:19:46,007
It's.. I think it's odd.

2696
02:19:47,213 --> 02:19:50,047
- Do you recall?
- Carnage Cooperation?

2697
02:19:51,218 --> 02:19:54,953

02:19:54,954 --> 02:19:58,014
Excuse me, I have to ask,
is that your real hair?

2699
02:19:58,191 --> 02:20:00,057
Are you gonna say
anything about that?

2700
02:20:00,227 --> 02:20:01,210
- Will you never comment
on my hair, is that

2701
02:20:01,211 --> 02:20:02,227

- I just asking about that.

2702
02:20:02,228 --> 02:20:03,269
Is this personal question?

2703
02:20:03,931 --> 02:20:05,130
I wondering why you wearing
something like that.

2704
02:20:05,131 --> 02:20:07,191

02:20:09,202 --> 02:20:11,037
Can I get you anything
else gentlemen?

me to drink one of those

2708
02:20:17,010 --> 02:20:20,112
We were specifically adviced
not to leave the country.

2709
02:20:20,113 --> 02:20:22,981
So, we took our wives to Italy.

2710
02:20:22,983 --> 02:20:24,638
We figure that we were
safer working from

2711
02:20:24,638 --> 02:20:26,218
over the seas, giving
orders to Rugrat.

2712
02:20:26,219 --> 02:20:28,054
Nobody could arrest us.

2713
02:20:28,055 --> 02:20:31,022
And nobody could prove I was still
running Stratton from a yacht.

2714
02:20:31,023 --> 02:20:35,227
Hey, Rugrats bonjour, you
bomheaded eagle, how you doing?

that shit up to but I'm so scared.

2844
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:23,041
I fucked up, I fucked up so bad.

2845
02:26:23,042 --> 02:26:27,173
- Get the ludes, downstairs.
- What do you say?

2846
02:26:29,114 --> 02:26:30,216
Get the ludes.

2847

I can't go down,
They're below deck!

2848
02:26:31,506 --> 02:26:33,152

Donnie, he fucking crazy.

2853
02:27:00,212 --> 02:27:03,113
Jesus Christ.

2854
02:27:03,984 --> 02:27:08,020
Hold on, get away from the
window, we'll gonna blown away.

2855
02:27:08,021 --> 02:27:10,236
Mayday! This is
Captain Ted Beecham

2856
02:27:10,236 --> 02:27:12,958
aboard the Yacht Naomi!
This is a Mayday!

2857
02:27:12,959 --> 02:27:15,995

2858
02:27:15,995 --> 02:27:18,063
Give me to me.

2859
02:27:18,064 --> 02:27:18,997
What you're gonna do right now.

2860
02:27:18,998 --> 02:27:23,025
This is a fucking may day.

2861
02:27:24,203 --> 02:27:26,933
(SCREAMING)

2862
02:27:28,108 --> 02:27:31,976
(MUSIK)

2863
02:27:34,147 --> 02:27:37,980
(CHOPPER SOUND)

2864
02:27:39,218 --> 02:27:42,154
Nice thing about getting
rescued by Italians..

2865
02:27:42,155 --> 02:27:46,024
...That they feed you,
make you drink red wine.

2866
02:27:46,025 --> 02:27:48,084
And you get to dance.

2867
02:28:02,075 --> 02:28:04,100
(EXPLOSION)

2868
02:28:04,209 --> 02:28:06,177
Did you see that?

2869
02:28:06,947 --> 02:28:10,148
That was the plane I
sent to come get us.

2870
02:28:10,149 --> 02:28:13,165
I shit you not, it
exploded when a seagull

2871
02:28:13,165 --> 02:28:16,180
flew into the engine,
three people killed.

2872
02:28:20,192 --> 02:28:22,193
You want a sign from God,

2873
02:28:22,194 --> 02:28:26,063
After all this I finally
got the message.

2874
02:28:31,037 --> 02:28:34,105
New dream, of becoming
financially indepedent.

2875
02:28:34,106 --> 02:28:37,141
But struggle every month
just to pay your bills.

2876
02:28:37,143 --> 02:28:39,210
Would you like to own
a home like this?

2877
02:28:39,211 --> 02:28:41,212
Who can barely afford
to pay your rent.

2878
02:28:41,213 --> 02:28:43,114
My name is Jordan Belfort.

2879
02:28:43,115 --> 02:28:45,117
And there is no secret
to well creation.

2880
02:28:45,118 --> 02:28:48,020
No matter who you are. No
matter where you came from.

2881
02:28:48,021 --> 02:28:52,156
You too can become finacially
independent in just a matter of months.

2882
02:28:52,157 --> 02:28:54,217
All you need is strategy.

2883
02:28:54,927 --> 02:28:57,228
When I was 24 years
old, I made a decision.

2884
02:28:57,229 --> 02:29:00,131
Not to survive, but to thrive.

2885
02:29:00,132 --> 02:29:03,002
At first I didn't feel like
deals like this were possible.

2886
02:29:03,003 --> 02:29:06,104
But we have the house, and we
have 30 thousand dollar profit.

2887
02:29:06,105 --> 02:29:07,206
I certainly beleive now.

2888
02:29:07,207 --> 02:29:09,040
I think about it for second.

2889
02:29:09,041 --> 02:29:11,222
If you don't have guts to
attend Jordan Belfort.

2890
02:29:11,224 --> 02:29:13,211
Straight line perssuasion
system seminar.

2891
02:29:13,212 --> 02:29:15,013
Then how do you, expect
to make any money.

2892
02:29:15,014 --> 02:29:16,949
You wanna be a
millionaire some day.

2893
02:29:16,950 --> 02:29:19,018
Have some guts make a decision.

2894
02:29:19,019 --> 02:29:21,986
Jordan belforth said work for
me because I work hard for it.

2895
02:29:21,987 --> 02:29:23,568
And if it doesn't work
for you it's because

2896
02:29:23,569 --> 02:29:25,190
you lazy, you should get
a job at McDonalds.

2897
02:29:25,191 --> 02:29:28,960
There is nobody holding you
back from financial freedom.

2898
02:29:28,961 --> 02:29:31,229
And there is nobody stoping
you from making millions.

2899
02:29:31,230 --> 02:29:36,998
Don't you sit in a home or the life
you dreamed will fly right pass.

2900
02:29:38,171 --> 02:29:42,106
I change all these people's live
and I can change yours too.

2901
02:29:42,108 --> 02:29:46,045
So come to my seminar, the
life of your dream is only..

2902
02:29:46,046 --> 02:29:49,948
- You're under arrest.
- You've got to be joking..

2903
02:29:51,016 --> 02:29:55,181
- Don't kidding, hey.
- Turn that Camera off.

2904
02:29:55,988 --> 02:29:58,957
You fuckin, you
fucking cocksucker.

2905
02:29:58,958 --> 02:30:02,127
Fuck you!

2906
02:30:02,128 --> 02:30:06,065
What the fuck you doing? You
fucking pieces of shit.

2907
02:30:06,066 --> 02:30:09,001
Hei Jordan let me give you
a little legal advice.

2908
02:30:09,002 --> 02:30:11,094
Shut up, fuck off.

2909
02:30:14,941 --> 02:30:16,140
(FBI, New York)
Jordan Belfort.

2910
02:30:16,976 --> 02:30:19,077
I cleaned on my
act, I did rehab.

2911
02:30:19,078 --> 02:30:20,211
I'm a Tv personality.

2912
02:30:20,212 --> 02:30:23,147
I'm sobber for 2 years,
and this happens.

2913
02:30:23,148 --> 02:30:27,019
Rugrat goes and get
busted down in Miami.

2914
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:28,986
And Guess who the fuck with?
Saurel.

2915
02:30:28,987 --> 02:30:32,156
- You gonna beat me? I
know your country. - No!

2916
02:30:32,157 --> 02:30:36,961
What the fucking odds? There had to be
ten thousand Swiss bankers in Geneva.

2917
02:30:36,962 --> 02:30:40,898
And Rugrat is the one dumb enough to
get himself arrested on U.S. soil.

2918
02:30:40,967 --> 02:30:42,134
I know.

2919
02:30:42,135 --> 02:30:44,193
(CRYING)

2920
02:30:46,004 --> 02:30:50,109
Even more fucked was he got busted for
shit that had nothing to do with me.

2921
02:30:50,110 --> 02:30:52,010
And nothing to
fucking do with me.

2922
02:30:52,011 --> 02:30:54,384
Something about
laundering drug money, to

2923

a guy name Rocky aoki.

2924
02:30:57,049 --> 02:30:59,150
You know the founder

2925
02:30:59,152 --> 02:31:00,986
Benihana?

2926
02:31:00,986 --> 02:31:02,987
Beni Fucking Hana.

2927
02:31:02,988 --> 02:31:07,126
Beni 'fucking' Hana,

Restaurants to take me down?

2930
02:31:15,033 --> 02:31:17,873
Long story, short Saurel
ratted me out, but

2931
02:31:17,875 --> 02:31:21,005
not before he ratted out
Brad's wife Chantalle.

2932
02:31:21,006 --> 02:31:25,067
Who turns out he been fuckin

2933
02:31:27,947 --> 02:31:30,108
No, no, no.

2934
02:31:31,217 --> 02:31:32,979

2941
02:32:06,084 --> 02:32:08,219

2942
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:11,156

2944
02:32:13,993 --> 02:32:17,962

2945
02:32:17,963 --> 02:32:20,933

2956
02:32:54,200 --> 02:32:56,191
Irresponsble prick.

2957
02:32:56,935 --> 02:32:58,904
I'll tell you one thing.

2958
02:32:59,972 --> 02:33:03,108
That you never eat
Benihana again.

2959
02:33:03,109 --> 02:33:06,010
I don't care who's
birthday it is.

2960
02:33:06,945 --> 02:33:09,004
What is that Naomi
actually doing?

2961
02:33:09,082 --> 02:33:12,108
She right in the house there, say hi
she probably won't wave you back.

2962
02:33:12,184 --> 02:33:14,983
Naomi, sweetheart.

2963
02:33:18,023 --> 02:33:19,958

No you know.

2965
02:33:20,994 --> 02:33:24,095
Probably had to mortgage
the house to make bail.

2966
02:33:24,096 --> 02:33:28,000
Probably ended sell a thing in
order pay for all my lawyers.

2967
02:33:28,001 --> 02:33:31,003
It's been a night mare
buddy, I tell you the truth.

02:33:31,004 --> 02:33:33,104

02:33:39,945 --> 02:33:40,934
Jordan.

2972
02:33:41,213 --> 02:33:44,047
I got the founding
partners together.

2973
02:33:44,149 --> 02:33:46,948

02:34:07,974 --> 02:34:10,942
- I'll kiss you.
- Alright, enough, enough.

2979
02:34:12,111 --> 02:34:14,979
- You wanna beer, pal?
- What do you drink?

2980
02:34:14,980 --> 02:34:17,049
We got this non-alcoholic shit.

2981
02:34:17,049 --> 02:34:19,217
- What is that?
- It's non alcoholic beer.

2982
02:34:19,218 --> 02:34:21,185
It's got no alchohol.

2983
02:34:21,186 --> 02:34:24,056
- Is it beer?
- Ya, with no alchohol.

2984
02:34:24,057 --> 02:34:27,959
But you drink enough and you drink
a lot to get you fucked up.

2985
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:30,028
No, it's no alchoholic
fucking point.

2986
02:34:30,029 --> 02:34:31,541
I'm not a scientist, I
don't get fuck target

2987
02:34:31,542 --> 02:34:33,097
but I can get you a
beer, if you want..

2988
02:34:33,099 --> 02:34:36,033
I know, but I don't
drink, you remember.

2989
02:34:36,034 --> 02:34:38,102
- I'm not drink anymore.
- Are you wanna go inside.

2990
02:34:38,103 --> 02:34:41,073
And blow some lime
and baking powder..

2991
02:34:41,207 --> 02:34:44,109
Can't imagine ever not
enjoyed geting fucked up.

2992
02:34:44,110 --> 02:34:45,943
- Yeah.
- I loved it.

2993
02:34:45,944 --> 02:34:47,145
But I've been sobber.

2994
02:34:47,146 --> 02:34:48,180
Fucking sucks.

2995
02:34:48,181 --> 02:34:50,114
- Boring right.
- So boring.

2996
02:34:50,115 --> 02:34:52,117
Like kill myself.

2997
02:34:52,118 --> 02:34:56,220
There is a term and we don't like to
use it unless circumtances dictate..

2998
02:34:56,221 --> 02:34:58,664
...I think they do
dictate in this case and

2999
02:34:58,665 --> 02:35:01,226
term is Grenada, have
you ever heard Grenada.

3000
02:35:01,227 --> 02:35:02,159
No I haven't.

3001
02:35:02,161 --> 02:35:05,632
Grenada very interesting
because it is a small

3002
02:35:05,634 --> 02:35:08,995
island nation that was
invaded by the United.

3003
02:35:08,996 --> 02:35:12,103
States of America 1983
have 9000 people.

3004
02:35:12,104 --> 02:35:15,073
And essentially means is.

3005
02:35:15,074 --> 02:35:18,143
This case is unloseable.

3006
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:20,503
So, you know, come in
we can have our dick

3007
02:35:20,504 --> 02:35:23,114
hanging out of our pants,
nobody gives a fuck.

3008
02:35:23,115 --> 02:35:25,049
I'm gonna win.

3009
02:35:25,050 --> 02:35:27,019
You Sir.

3010
02:35:27,953 --> 02:35:29,922
Are was known.

3011
02:35:30,156 --> 02:35:32,147
As a Grenada.

3012
02:35:35,028 --> 02:35:38,163
You're looking at
real prison time.

3013
02:35:38,164 --> 02:35:41,967
Money laundering can get
you as much 20 years.

3014
02:35:41,968 --> 02:35:43,906
And, our case gonna
be stronger, if we

3015
02:35:43,906 --> 02:35:46,138
caught your shed and
cash your mattress,.

3016
02:35:46,138 --> 02:35:47,969
Oh that right.

3017
02:35:48,074 --> 02:35:50,007
Hei Jordan.

3018
02:35:50,009 --> 02:35:55,112
Jordan, You're rotting away in jail,
2 your kids get out the college.

3019
02:35:55,113 --> 02:35:57,980
That's not our ambition here.

3020
02:35:58,150 --> 02:36:00,949
There's other people
involve in this too.

3021
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:04,183
We think, they need to see
their day in courts as well.

3022
02:36:06,225 --> 02:36:08,959
Why do I sense there's
an offer in the air?

3023
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:10,128
He's got good sense.

3024
02:36:10,129 --> 02:36:12,063
What are you, Craskin?

3025
02:36:12,230 --> 02:36:14,790
Full cooperation, he
provides us with the

3026
02:36:14,790 --> 02:36:17,865
comprehensive list of all
coconspirators spanning

3027
02:36:17,867 --> 02:36:21,003
the last seven years and
he agrees to wear a wire.

3028
02:36:21,207 --> 02:36:24,108
- Did you just say wear a wire?
- A wire.

3029
02:36:24,209 --> 02:36:27,111
Wow, wow, is that means, you
want me to rat, is that it?

3030
02:36:27,112 --> 02:36:28,979
No, I want you to cooperate.

3031
02:36:28,980 --> 02:36:31,115
- No, you want me to rat.
- Yes, we want you to rat.

3032
02:36:31,117 --> 02:36:35,177
That fucking exactly what
we want you to do, to rat.

3033
02:36:39,125 --> 02:36:40,922
How is Christy's party?

3034
02:36:41,059 --> 02:36:44,029
- Fine.
- Good.

3035
02:36:44,963 --> 02:36:47,057
Babe, I've spoke to the
lawyers again today.

3036
02:36:47,132 --> 02:36:51,068
There is some really
really great news.

3037
02:36:51,938 --> 02:36:55,173
Turns out you completely
off the hook, honey.

3038
02:36:55,174 --> 02:36:57,075
I know that already.

3039
02:36:57,075 --> 02:37:02,207
Right, exactly, you never did
anything wrong in first place right?

3040
02:37:02,981 --> 02:37:09,186
It turns out, all the FBI really
wants for me is to a coorperate.

3041
02:37:09,188 --> 02:37:11,692
You know.. turns out I
have so much information

3042
02:37:11,693 --> 02:37:14,024
about the stock market
and the Wallstreet..

3043
02:37:14,025 --> 02:37:16,548
That I could save the
government years of

3044
02:37:16,549 --> 02:37:19,191
heartache not to mention
countless dollars.

3045
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,968
It gets even better babe.

3046
02:37:22,968 --> 02:37:28,907
Because if I do to sign cooperate, I
might only be looking at 4 short years.

3047
02:37:28,975 --> 02:37:33,111
How much case, we could start
fresh maybe sell the house.

3048
02:37:33,111 --> 02:37:37,014
And any fine that I have to pay
wouldn't due till I serve term.

3049
02:37:37,015 --> 02:37:40,975
So, we still have plenty
money left over, you know.

3050
02:37:41,987 --> 02:37:47,125
You think, of course bug me out a little
bit is this whole idea for doing it.

3051
02:37:47,126 --> 02:37:49,093
Give an information
about my friends.

3052
02:37:49,194 --> 02:37:52,963
Ohh, like he said, ther is no
friend on Wallstrett right.

3053
02:37:52,965 --> 02:37:54,057
Right.

3054
02:37:54,132 --> 02:37:58,170
It's exactly silver lining to that too
honey because they said eventually.

3055
02:37:58,171 --> 02:38:01,072
Eventually everyone gonna have to
give an information on this case.

3056
02:38:01,073 --> 02:38:04,109
So at the end of the day, might
not even a factor, you know.

3057
02:38:04,110 --> 02:38:08,146
- Well, that's a good news,
right. - Yeah, yeah.

3058
02:38:08,147 --> 02:38:10,206
I'm really happy for you.

3059
02:38:11,984 --> 02:38:15,111
What do you mean
you happy for me?

3060
02:38:15,188 --> 02:38:19,156
- You should be happy for the
both of us right? - Yeah right.

3061
02:38:19,157 --> 02:38:20,182
Alright.

3062
02:38:22,093 --> 02:38:23,924
Come here baby.

3063
02:38:24,163 --> 02:38:27,131
- Gimme a kiss, sweetheart.

- Get off me.
- Ohh Baby don't do that.

02:38:50,189 --> 02:38:53,920

I want you to fuck me like

02:39:16,949 --> 02:39:20,018
- Come babe, 'cause I need you to

3077
02:39:20,019 --> 02:39:27,015
Come for me baby, I need you to come
for me like its a last fucking time.

3078
02:39:27,192 --> 02:39:29,957
Come baby.

02:39:57,989 --> 02:40:02,120
Ohh, baby that was

3080
02:40:05,931 --> 02:40:07,989
That was a last time.

3081

What do you mean baby?

3082
02:40:10,036 --> 02:40:13,004
I mean that was a last
time we had a sex.

3083
02:40:14,073 --> 02:40:16,097
What are you talking about.

3084
02:40:18,043 --> 02:40:20,102
I want to divorce.

3085
02:40:21,904 --> 02:40:23,543
What do you mean, you

02:40:23,545 --> 02:40:25,216
