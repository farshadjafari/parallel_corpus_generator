1
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:44,450
Today the new words are the following:

2
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,161
Sea ..

3
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,375
Highway...

4
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:53,134
Roadtrip...

5
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,054
and shotgun.

6
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:05,102
"Sea" is the leather chair
with wooden armrests

7
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:07,814
like the one in the living room.

8
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:13,365
Example:
Don't remain standing,

9
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,200
sit down in the "sea"
to have a chat.

10
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:23,829
"Highway"
is a very strong wind.

11
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:32,462
"Roadtrip" is
highly durable material ...

12
00:01:32,804 --> 00:01:35,804
used to make floors.

13
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,973
Example:

14
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,141
The chandelier fell and smashed itself
on the floor,

15
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,972
but the floor was not damaged,

16
00:01:45,316 --> 00:01:48,816
cause its made
100% of "roadtrip".

17
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:53,777
Shotgun.

18
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:59,328
"Shotgun"
is a beautiful white bird.

19
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:10,376
I suggest playing
a game of endurance.

20
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:16,050
We open the
hot water taps

21
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:19,510
and each puts his finger
under hot water.

22
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:23,801
The one who keeps it there
the longets, wins.

23
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,471
What do you think?

24
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:32,021
I...I like it.

25
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:35,358
- And you?
- Me too.

26
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:39,030
Should we open all faucets
or just one?

27
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:41,742
We can open only one,
if you prefer.

28
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:43,867
And how will we time it?

29
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,123
With a stopwatch
or a clock?

30
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:51,799
No need for it. We'll all put
our finger under the water.

31
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:55,218
Whoever removes it last
is the winner

32
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:59,841
So we need
all three faucets ?

33
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:04,305
Just one will do.

34
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:08,645
with all taps on
one could cheat.

35
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:13,277
We could use the big one in
the bathtub. The tap.

36
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:17,572
And what should we call
this game?

37
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:30,118
I don't know ...

38
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:41,677
Do you like the music?
I could change it if you want.

39
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:45,770
No, it's fine.

40
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:50,730
Don't be shy.
If you don't like it just say so.

41
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,814
No, I like it.

42
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,733
What's your favorite song?

43
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:03,153
I have two.

44
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:13,959
Have you taken a shower today?

45
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:16,625
Yes.

46
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,629
You washed your hair?

47
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:24,053
No, I've washed them yesterday.

48
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:24,574
- Are you dizzy?
- No, I'm fine.

49
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:46,721
Are you done?

50
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:50,562
Christina is here.

51
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,709
- Hi Christina!
- Hi.

52
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:25,759
You've lost weight.

53
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:28,298
Yes, a bit.

54
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:31,345
Can I stay or am I
interrupting?

55
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:34,980
Stay. You don't bother me.
In the slightest

56
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:48,073
What's that on your headband?

57
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,988
Phosphorescent stones.

58
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:52,989
Phosphorescent?

59
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:56,462
They light up in the dark.

60
00:08:57,963 --> 00:09:00,039
Without plugging them in?

61
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:01,379
Yes.

62
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:04,552
You're lying?

63
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:06,381
I swear!

64
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:09,472
Where did you get it?

65
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,475
I made it.

66
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:14,386
Congrats.

67
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,144
Thank you.

68
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:19,938
Do you have a headband?

69
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:23,197
I have. A brown one.
But I gave it to my little sister

70
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:27,197
in exchange for a pair of socks
and two rubber erasers.

71
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,658
The socks you wear?

72
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:31,907
No, not those.

73
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:35,375
These are pretty too.

74
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,624
Thank you.

75
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,335
will you stay for dinner?

76
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:46,341
No, I have go.

77
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:49,635
Too bad, we're having burger.

78
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:52,682
Burger is one of my favorite dishes.

79
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:58,106
What other food do you like?

80
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:03,192
Fish soup
and cheese pie.

81
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,903
Fish soup and cheese pie
are the best.

82
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:08,947
- I had soup yesterday.
- Great.

83
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:24,802
I added apple
in the juice.

84
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:26,381
It's delicious.

85
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:33,138
Unfortunately I'll have to go.

86
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:35,852
Could we shoot a video together?

87
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:38,941
Yes, we don't have one
with Christina in it.

88
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:41,731
Is it okay if we shoot a video?

89
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,184
Not at all.

90
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:58,376
Daddy, could I sit
next to Christina?

91
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:00,288
Yes, sweetie.

92
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:11,885
Could you smile a bit more Christina?

93
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:39,783
Consider a triangle whose angles
are 36, 77 and 67 degrees.

94
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:44,123
Side A is 12.8cm long

95
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:48,335
side C is 9.7 cm long.

96
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:52,298
Calculate the triangle's area,
the length of the B side

97
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,018
and the type of triangle.

98
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:55,551
Good luck!

99
00:11:57,062 --> 00:12:00,847
We know that a fish is not fresh
if the eyes are not:

100
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,225
A: Muddy.

101
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:04,898
B: Big

102
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:07,361
C: Red.

103
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:09,027
Good luck.

104
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:17,198
If it's 11 pm, and we have't
managed to fall asleep,

105
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,866
what is the procedure to follow?

106
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:22,999
Good luck.

107
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:20,977
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

108
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,769
- Should I wait for you?
- Yes.

109
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,692
- How do I look?
- Perfect.

110
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:34,610
And from behind?

111
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:37,740
It's perfect.

112
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:43,080
I think the skirt doesn't match
the blouse.

113
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,834
- How many do you have?
- 37.

114
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:53,513
- If you cheat, they'll find out.
- I have 37. And you?

115
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:54,845
52.

116
00:13:57,061 --> 00:14:00,264
- You might have the most.
- No way.

117
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:13,657
- More salad?
- No.

118
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:27,955
We're out of iodine, and
the antihistamines, have expired

119
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:30,256
and I'm out of bandages too.

120
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:32,881
I'll make you a list.
When you can.

121
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:34,384
As you wish honey.

122
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:36,716
Dad, I need brown color
for your eyebrows.

123
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:38,552
Didn't I brought you some
last week?

124
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:43,769
I've consumed it.
I absolutely need it..

125
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:46,514
I can't paint your eyebrows blue.
It would be untruthful.

126
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,485
I'll bring some more.

127
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,990
- Lemon?
- No, thank you.

128
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:02,578
We're also out of meat.
You should buy some.

129
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:07,874
Mom, can you
pass me the phone, please?

130
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:10,586
Thank you.

131
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:14,466
- Did you do the count?
- I have 76.

132
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:16,181
I have 52.

133
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:17,924
37.

134
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:21,554
Girls, you must try harder.

135
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:24,181
Your brother is the winner once more.

136
00:15:25,774 --> 00:15:29,438
That means, he will choose
our entertainment for tonight.

137
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,653
But I have a surprise for you.

138
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,448
Something unprecedented.

139
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,869
The next reward won't be
just 1 or 2 stickers,

140
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,701
but 10!

141
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,533
So You must do your best.

142
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:46,378
You understand how important it is.

143
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,125
Yes, absolutely.

144
00:15:49,258 --> 00:15:52,211
The winner will tell us
how to spend the evening.

145
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:53,466
I choose the video.

146
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:55,961
We haven't watched a video
for quite some time.

147
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:57,716
Today is a good opportunity.

148
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:15,404
Dad, can I use the hose as well?

149
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:17,947
Run!

150
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:20,614
Oh! Beware!

151
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:26,538
Look there is a dead plant there.

152
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,500
Look there's more.

153
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:30,913
An airplane, Dad!

154
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:36,052
Can you bring me a wet cloth?

155
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:38,428
Where is it, Mom?

156
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,388
In the closet, under the sink.

157
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:46,895
Be careful so you don't bring me
a clean, dust cloth.

158
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,183
Wait! It might fall down.

159
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:54,652
Careful!

160
00:16:55,408 --> 00:16:58,113
How nice!
I want to see too.

161
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,567
I wash it better than you.

162
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,117
I also clean the floor mats
and tires.

163
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:51,334
I never forget the car deodorant.
Except once.

164
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:56,924
It had such a great smell.
I thought..

165
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:58,627
I had sprayed some already.

166
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:03,551
You, you never did,

167
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:06,678
and you didn't do the mats

168
00:18:07,022 --> 00:18:10,971
when they had difficult stains
like mud or tar.

169
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:15,688
i wish you could see
how good I wash it.

170
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:18,902
You'd cry! If you could see.

171
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,993
He's by the fence again.

172
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,116
He started it
He threw stones at me.

173
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:03,778
Your brother
would never do such a thing.

174
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:42,482
Not yet.
I'll tell you when.

175
00:19:50,752 --> 00:19:51,867
Wait a bit.

176
00:20:00,596 --> 00:20:01,971
Go ahead, spit.

177
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:20,321
Oh, I wish it would fall!

178
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:24,282
If it falls,
it will be mine.

179
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:29,579
if it falls, the one who deserves it
will have it.

180
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:54,981
- Hello.
- How are you?

181
00:20:55,651 --> 00:20:57,691
Good. My leg hurts a bit.

182
00:20:58,028 --> 00:21:00,189
When will you be back at the house?

183
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:04,401
I'll have to check my shifts.
I think afternoon is best, next week.

184
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:06,323
Do you use the perfume
I gave you?

185
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:07,328
Yes.

186
00:21:07,665 --> 00:21:09,326
Does it smell good?

187
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:10,699
It smells very good.

188
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:53,625
Good morning.
Mr. Petrou is asking for you.

189
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:55,919
- When did you last watered the plant?
- Two weeks ago.

190
00:21:56,256 --> 00:21:58,876
- Do it every week.
- OK. Should I tell him to come over?

191
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:01,002
- No, I'm going to him.
- Good.

192
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:14,060
I have a belly ache
since yesterday evening.

193
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:16,397
Where exactly?

194
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,107
In the upper right.
It might be appendicitis.

195
00:22:25,452 --> 00:22:28,240
Appendicitis is down, right.

196
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:36,921
- Does it hurt here?
- No.

197
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:38,496
There?

198
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,008
- There?
- No.

199
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,753
- Does it hurt here?
- Yes.

200
00:22:45,387 --> 00:22:48,640
- No fruit and vegetables.
- I drank some milk.

201
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:52,808
It's okay.
Avoid doing much today.

202
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:56,234
- Will you'll give me some pills?
- No need for it.

203
00:22:56,567 --> 00:23:00,152
If you follow my instructions,
you'll be better.

204
00:23:00,488 --> 00:23:04,320
Otherwise your condition will worsen.

205
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:08,490
Get up? Do you want to play something?

206
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,738
We have about 20 minutes free.

207
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:14,661
I have a new anesthetic.
Should we try it?

208
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:15,916
Yes.

209
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,874
The one who wakes up first,
wins.

210
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:27,387
Don't put more on mine.

211
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:37,477
One, two, three.

212
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:21,105
It's almost done. it just need
tiles and lights.

213
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:23,935
I can't chose between those two.

214
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:33,702
- Those.
- I prefer the other.

215
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:35,955
These are good too.

216
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,000
- How's your wife?
- No change.

217
00:24:39,337 --> 00:24:40,038
Do you go out at all?

218
00:24:40,838 --> 00:24:42,119
No.

219
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:46,050
You should, I told you.
Even in a wheelchair.

220
00:24:46,387 --> 00:24:48,925
She is ashamed.
She doesn't wants visitors either.

221
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:52,847
You know haw many times I asked her
to invite you over? A 100 or more.

222
00:24:53,185 --> 00:24:54,300
I understand your situation.

223
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:56,888
What happened to her is tragic

224
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,471
It takes great courage to overcome it.

225
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:02,688
And she looks so alive in the photo.

226
00:25:03,028 --> 00:25:04,606
She was volleyball champion, right?

227
00:25:04,946 --> 00:25:05,895
Handball.

228
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,823
So, you prefer these, ha?

229
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,118
Yes, but those are good too.

230
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:50,442
Hello?

231
00:25:51,871 --> 00:25:54,656
I was in a meeting.
In a meeting, yes.

232
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:58,791
Did they go in the yard?
Did they compete?

233
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:02,792
What's wrong with her?
The belly or the stomach?

234
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:04,670
Yes, it's a bit cold.

235
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,958
I would like to take my dog.

236
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:56,307
Sorry, it's impossible.

237
00:26:56,644 --> 00:27:00,558
He's still in the 2nd stage of training.

238
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:04,478
I'll show you.

239
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:15,992
1st, 2nd stage,

240
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,792
the one your dog is in,
3rd, 4th, 5th and final stage.

241
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:31,051
Let me explain.

242
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:33,799
A dog is like clay.

243
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:38,185
Our job here
is to shape it.

244
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:41,391
A dog can be dynamic,

245
00:27:42,566 --> 00:27:46,349
aggressive, a fighter,
coward or affectionate.

246
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:53,156
It requires work, patience,
and attention from us.

247
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:56,997
Every dog, your dog is waiting
from us to teach him

248
00:27:57,332 --> 00:27:59,573
how to behave.

249
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,624
You understand?

250
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:05,536
We, we are here to determine

251
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:10,839
what behavior
the dog should have.

252
00:28:11,886 --> 00:28:16,430
Do you want a pet,
or a friend? a companion?

253
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:23,181
Or a keeper
that respects its master

254
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,436
and obeys our orders?

255
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,030
Do you understand?

256
00:28:30,531 --> 00:28:31,528
I do.

257
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:42,873
Rex!

258
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:46,585
Rex!

259
00:30:54,176 --> 00:30:55,458
1 min 15.

260
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,065
2 min.

261
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:18,573
2 mins 30.

262
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:23,699
2 mins 45.

263
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:34,134
3 min 15.

264
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:45,435
3 min 45.

265
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,241
4 min 30.

266
00:32:13,884 --> 00:32:15,792
5 min 15.

267
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:23,385
5 min 30.

268
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,616
What do you mean, you can't?

269
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:05,869
Sorry.

270
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:10,206
It's not for me, but for you
that we do this.

271
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:11,742
Sorry.

272
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:16,835
Try again, with your tongue,
otherwise it's no use

273
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:28,521
Don't tell Dad.

274
00:34:29,563 --> 00:34:31,269
- It disgusts you?
- No.

275
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:33,052
So?

276
00:34:35,193 --> 00:34:37,483
I prefer what we did the other time.

277
00:34:53,588 --> 00:34:54,333
Hello.

278
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,664
What are you doing?

279
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:02,713
I clean the carpet
to eliminate bacteria.

280
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:18,608
- Do you want my head clamp?
- Very much.

281
00:35:19,362 --> 00:35:21,070
What will you give me in return?

282
00:35:27,036 --> 00:35:29,789
You want this pencil?
It has an eraser at the end.

283
00:35:30,123 --> 00:35:30,989
No.

284
00:35:37,798 --> 00:35:39,175
This measuring tape?

285
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:43,257
You press here
and it contracts back .

286
00:35:44,181 --> 00:35:45,094
No.

287
00:35:56,443 --> 00:36:00,192
Come close and lick me here.
Then it's yours.

288
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:03,235
Does it disgusts you?

289
00:36:03,784 --> 00:36:04,697
No.

290
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:33,351
- Shall we dance?
- I'm not in the mood.

291
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,481
And we don't have enough time.
We must see mom in a little while.

292
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,690
Mom will be late.
She talks to herself again.

293
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,813
Stop it.

294
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:45,610
You get scared when mom
talks alone in her room.

295
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,947
No.

296
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:48,568
- Yes, you are.
- Wrong.

297
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:50,534
- But you are.
- No.

298
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:54,411
You can't hear her
She might talk about you.

299
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:56,032
She doesn't talk about me!

300
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,461
If I gave you a gift,
will you'll lick me?

301
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:08,010
- What kind of gift?
- A headband.

302
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:09,630
I have one already.

303
00:37:10,018 --> 00:37:12,306
This one is phosphorescent.

304
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:14,389
What does that mean?

305
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:16,731
It glitters in the dark.

306
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:18,639
Where did you get it ?

307
00:37:18,985 --> 00:37:20,360
I can't tell you.

308
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:23,532
Do our parents know you have it?

309
00:37:23,864 --> 00:37:24,565
No.

310
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:28,661
It can become yours, very easily.

311
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,617
Where do you want me to lick you?

312
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,576
At the shoulder.

313
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,885
You'll buy chocolates?

314
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:57,226
Only if there's it's on your way.

315
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,768
Any kind.

316
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,697
Yes those are good.

317
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,242
Me too.

318
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,268
This is not your.

319
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:22,059
Leave me alone.

320
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,226
- Does it still hurt?
- Yes.

321
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:44,403
You can ask Dad to get it for you
with the car.

322
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:47,228
That's what I would do.

323
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:49,032
There is no other way.

324
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:54,701
Daddy!

325
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:01,954
The eldest threw the plane
over the wall. Could you get it?

326
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:04,621
- Where is it?
- Right outside.

327
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:07,123
I'll try.

328
00:43:33,574 --> 00:43:35,318
How did it happened?

329
00:43:37,077 --> 00:43:38,322
What did you tell them?

330
00:43:40,164 --> 00:43:42,074
Good.

331
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:44,416
I'll tell them, too.

332
00:43:45,545 --> 00:43:48,333
It's a good opportunity.

333
00:43:48,882 --> 00:43:49,795
Yes.

334
00:43:51,635 --> 00:43:55,052
The temperature will rise
and the wind will fall.

335
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:59,681
5 or 6 degrees.

336
00:44:01,394 --> 00:44:02,592
OK.

337
00:44:04,648 --> 00:44:09,311
No, it's time to put an end to it.
Its exhausting for everyone

338
00:44:11,822 --> 00:44:15,190
I agree.
You're absolutely right.

339
00:44:16,244 --> 00:44:17,025
Yes.

340
00:44:42,103 --> 00:44:43,846
Your brother is dead.

341
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:48,893
A creature like the one
in the garden tore hip apart.

342
00:44:50,277 --> 00:44:51,358
On one hand...

343
00:44:51,697 --> 00:44:55,945
he made a huge mistake,
venturing out ill prepared..

344
00:44:58,077 --> 00:45:02,121
On the other hand, he was my son
and I feel sorry for him

345
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,159
The animal that threatens us
is a "cat".

346
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,329
The most dangerous animal there is

347
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:12,795
He eats meat.
Children's flesh in particular.

348
00:45:13,385 --> 00:45:16,005
After lacerating it's victims
with its claws,

349
00:45:16,304 --> 00:45:18,047
It devours them with sharp teeth.

350
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:20,382
The face and whole body of the victim

351
00:45:21,309 --> 00:45:24,809
If you stay inside,
you are protected

352
00:45:25,896 --> 00:45:28,103
We have to be ready.

353
00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:32,356
in case it invades the house
or the garden.

354
00:46:25,206 --> 00:46:26,784
Our dear brother

355
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:33,416
we're sorry you couldn't kill the cat,

356
00:46:34,384 --> 00:46:35,842
as I did.

357
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:39,007
We will miss you ...

358
00:46:40,724 --> 00:46:42,847
despite the mistakes you did

359
00:46:50,858 --> 00:46:52,400
It's a pity

360
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,733
that this would happen to you

361
00:46:56,072 --> 00:47:00,900
and I wasn't able to use
my knowledge to save you.

362
00:47:08,585 --> 00:47:12,748
My dear brother,
I would have never imagine

363
00:47:14,007 --> 00:47:17,458
that things could go so wrong.

364
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:24,512
I hoped that you'd survive
on the supplies i secured for you.

365
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:28,262
But there are too many dangers.

366
00:47:29,523 --> 00:47:31,184
I'm so sad ...

367
00:47:34,945 --> 00:47:38,067
You press three times on the chest.
With force.

368
00:47:38,782 --> 00:47:39,697
One

369
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:41,197
two

370
00:47:41,577 --> 00:47:42,490
three.

371
00:47:43,454 --> 00:47:45,530
Then you block the nose,

372
00:47:45,873 --> 00:47:48,661
open the mouth
and you blow.

373
00:48:59,864 --> 00:49:01,275
I am pregnant.

374
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:06,199
A boy and a girl.
Twins.

375
00:49:06,706 --> 00:49:08,034
How about two boys?

376
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:11,117
No, a girl and boy.

377
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,213
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

378
00:49:14,547 --> 00:49:15,793
How about triplets?

379
00:49:17,842 --> 00:49:19,634
It would be too much.

380
00:49:21,554 --> 00:49:23,382
You're right. Twins.

381
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:28,893
The same thing on your backs.

382
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:44,318
The same thing facing front.

383
00:49:54,338 --> 00:49:55,666
O.K.

384
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,791
Dive in.

385
00:50:09,268 --> 00:50:10,182
Ready?

386
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:13,893
3, 2, 1, go!

387
00:50:30,373 --> 00:50:31,202
Soon,

388
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:34,626
your mother will give birth to
two children and a dog.

389
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:40,086
I know some of you will resent

390
00:50:40,425 --> 00:50:43,260
having to share a room

391
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:45,755
clothes, or even toys.

392
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:47,472
But

393
00:50:47,809 --> 00:50:49,516
you must look on the bright:

394
00:50:49,853 --> 00:50:51,891
You'll have two more people
to care for you.

395
00:50:52,228 --> 00:50:53,688
The family will grow bigger

396
00:50:54,023 --> 00:50:57,557
And I want us to applaud
your mother for this big gift.

397
00:51:08,454 --> 00:51:10,282
I don't want to share
my room.

398
00:51:10,623 --> 00:51:13,708
If you're a good girl,
you will not have to.

399
00:51:14,043 --> 00:51:15,121
I will be good.

400
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:18,206
I don't want to share either.

401
00:51:19,507 --> 00:51:23,422
If your behavior
and your performance improves,

402
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,003
I may not have to give birth.

403
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:30,764
But if things don't change,
I will have no other choice.

404
00:51:31,434 --> 00:51:34,271
But I won't hear a thing
about the dog.

405
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:37,523
He will be born as soon as possible

406
00:51:46,657 --> 00:51:49,445
Great, darling,
bravo to you all.

407
00:51:49,786 --> 00:51:52,028
Dry yourself and come get your reward.

408
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:57,576
Dry your hands,
or it won't stick anymore.

409
00:51:59,172 --> 00:52:00,371
One more thing.

410
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:03,588
Your performance was worse
than last time

411
00:52:03,927 --> 00:52:05,208
I shouldn't say more..

412
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:09,972
Oh! A plane.

413
00:52:13,938 --> 00:52:15,480
It fell in the garden.

414
00:52:56,438 --> 00:52:58,563
Not so hard, you're hurting me.

415
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:02,148
Like that?

416
00:53:02,528 --> 00:53:03,478
Softer.

417
00:53:08,032 --> 00:53:09,492
Like this?

418
00:53:11,496 --> 00:53:12,574
Good.

419
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:24,842
You want me to lick you
so you'll give me gift?

420
00:53:25,175 --> 00:53:26,800
I have nothing to give you.

421
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:30,086
It's okay.

422
00:53:44,903 --> 00:53:46,565
here's a nice spot.

423
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:15,806
Good morning, Dad.

424
00:54:16,144 --> 00:54:17,972
Good morning.
How many hours did you sleep

425
00:54:18,313 --> 00:54:19,512
About 9.

426
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:06,143
Be careful of the pinky!

427
00:56:13,097 --> 00:56:14,757
Daddy!

428
00:56:17,101 --> 00:56:18,844
There are two fish
in the pool.

429
00:56:19,186 --> 00:56:19,802
What kind?

430
00:56:20,146 --> 00:56:23,561
I think they're sargos
but I'm not sure.

431
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:28,561
You should catch them.
Mom will be so glad if I'm right.

432
00:56:28,905 --> 00:56:31,443
I'll be there in a minute.

433
00:56:53,304 --> 00:56:54,800
There's three of them.

434
00:56:55,682 --> 00:56:59,384
It was just two before.
the third probably just swam in.

435
00:57:24,878 --> 00:57:27,251
The most creative time
for man is ...?

436
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:29,298
Between 30 and 40 years of age.

437
00:57:29,635 --> 00:57:31,793
And for women?

438
00:57:32,137 --> 00:57:33,465
Between 20 and 30.

439
00:57:34,556 --> 00:57:37,094
A child is ready to leave
his house when ...?

440
00:57:37,434 --> 00:57:39,094
When the right dogtooth falls off.

441
00:57:39,436 --> 00:57:41,476
Or the left one, doesn't really matter.

442
00:57:41,813 --> 00:57:43,806
At that time,
the body is ready

443
00:57:44,148 --> 00:57:45,726
to face all dangers.

444
00:57:46,985 --> 00:57:49,737
To leave the house in safety

445
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,731
one should use the car.

446
00:57:52,572 --> 00:57:54,530
When can one
learn to drive?

447
00:57:54,992 --> 00:57:57,365
When the right dogtooth grows back.

448
00:57:57,704 --> 00:57:59,697
Or the left, it doesn't really matter.

449
00:58:02,626 --> 00:58:05,081
Mom,
what is a "cunt"?

450
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,329
Where did you learn that word?

451
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,585
On a case on top of the VCR.

452
00:58:13,429 --> 00:58:15,836
A cunt is a large lamp.

453
00:58:16,264 --> 00:58:17,806
Example:

454
00:58:18,682 --> 00:58:23,597
The cunt switched of,
and the room got all dark.

455
00:58:30,989 --> 00:58:33,195
Do you want to hear
your grandfather singing?

456
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:34,195
Yes

457
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:14,028
Dad loves us.

458
00:59:15,907 --> 00:59:17,532
Mom loves us.

459
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,746
Do we love them?

460
00:59:22,081 --> 00:59:23,492
Yes, we love them.

461
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:26,286
I love my brothers and sisters

462
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:29,668
because they love me too.

463
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:33,795
Spring fills my house.

464
00:59:35,304 --> 00:59:37,545
Spring floods...

465
00:59:39,389 --> 00:59:40,967
my little heart.

466
00:59:43,311 --> 00:59:47,226
My parents are proud of me,

467
00:59:48,442 --> 00:59:50,934
because I do my best.

468
00:59:52,278 --> 00:59:57,617
But I'm always trying
to do better.

469
00:59:59,911 --> 01:00:03,778
My house, you're beautiful
and I love you.

470
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:07,369
And never ...

471
01:00:11,547 --> 01:00:12,461
I will never leave you.

472
01:00:58,219 --> 01:01:00,427
I dreamed of you the other day.

473
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:04,262
I was in a forest
with your father.

474
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,641
In the evening
we grilled potatoes.

475
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:12,101
Suddenly, we heard
noise in a bush.

476
01:01:12,443 --> 01:01:15,065
It was you...you were a zombie.

477
01:01:16,532 --> 01:01:19,237
Your father and I,
we threw stones at you.

478
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:22,280
- But we couldn't hit you.
- What was I?

479
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:24,195
A zombie.

480
01:01:25,123 --> 01:01:27,494
- You know what a zombie is?
- Yes.

481
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,873
- Do you see dreams?
- Sure.

482
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:34,461
Tell me a recent one.

483
01:01:37,177 --> 01:01:39,050
I saw Mom falling
in the pool.

484
01:01:39,387 --> 01:01:40,717
And then what?

485
01:01:41,391 --> 01:01:42,764
Nothing. Just that.

486
01:01:49,815 --> 01:01:52,768
I've brought
another gift. Hair gel.

487
01:01:53,108 --> 01:01:56,063
You put it in your hair to model it.

488
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:05,527
I don't like it.

489
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:07,204
What do you mean?

490
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:10,992
I do not like this gift.
Besides, I don't believe you.

491
01:02:11,336 --> 01:02:14,670
You said that the headband
sparkled. It was a Lie.

492
01:02:15,007 --> 01:02:17,213
It's true! It sparkles.

493
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:19,295
You did something wrong.

494
01:02:19,637 --> 01:02:20,882
I don't believe you.

495
01:02:21,222 --> 01:02:22,253
Look here.

496
01:02:26,978 --> 01:02:28,010
Look at me.

497
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:32,389
Look.

498
01:02:39,864 --> 01:02:43,614
If you want me to lick you,
you have to offer me something better.

499
01:02:43,952 --> 01:02:45,327
I have nothing else.

500
01:02:53,795 --> 01:02:54,791
I want these.

501
01:02:56,048 --> 01:02:57,331
I can't give them to you.

502
01:02:58,217 --> 01:03:00,376
- I want them.
- Impossible.

503
01:03:00,846 --> 01:03:02,304
Then you must leave.

504
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:04,431
I can't give them to you.

505
01:03:04,766 --> 01:03:07,387
Get out.
I will never lick you again!

506
01:03:08,686 --> 01:03:09,635
And I'll tell my parents

507
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,139
you gave me a headband.
And that you asked me to lick you

508
01:03:12,483 --> 01:03:17,393
down low, at your keyboard.
And all that happened.

509
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:22,074
You know what dad do if he finds out
that I lick your keyboard?

510
01:03:39,342 --> 01:03:42,842
You should give them
back to me next week.

511
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,606
Mommy, what's a zombie?

512
01:04:06,327 --> 01:04:08,320
Where did you hear this word?

513
01:04:08,664 --> 01:04:10,407
Don't remember. Dad probably said it.

514
01:04:18,342 --> 01:04:21,260
A zombie
is a small yellow flower.

515
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,385
What are you doing there?

516
01:05:44,721 --> 01:05:47,806
I couldn't sleep.
I'm nervous.

517
01:05:49,684 --> 01:05:50,798
I'm afraid.

518
01:05:51,143 --> 01:05:55,092
If you won't go out in the garden alone
nothing will happen to you.

519
01:05:56,398 --> 01:05:58,391
I won't let anything happen to you.

520
01:06:02,739 --> 01:06:04,898
Dad, I want to learn how to fight.

521
01:06:05,784 --> 01:06:07,659
What did you say? I can't hear you.

522
01:06:08,994 --> 01:06:10,987
When do I learn to fight?

523
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:14,539
You can shut down your robot?

524
01:06:15,128 --> 01:06:18,293
I'll fight, so you won't have to.

525
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,088
You need to use your head
for something else

526
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,094
than a punching bag.
Like I do.

527
01:06:29,516 --> 01:06:32,137
Your head does not look
like a punching bag.

528
01:06:32,684 --> 01:06:33,800
No.

529
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:36,601
That's good. Thanks.

530
01:06:38,735 --> 01:06:40,858
It looks like
a baseball glove.

531
01:06:41,195 --> 01:06:43,353
You're a wise guy, ha?

532
01:06:44,614 --> 01:06:47,985
Mr. Balboa, Mr. Creed's on the phone.

533
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:22,141
There are all kinds of sharks.

534
01:07:23,195 --> 01:07:24,655
Hammerhead,

535
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:27,949
the blue shark, mako,
white shark.

536
01:07:30,077 --> 01:07:33,744
it's unlikely that those fools
got the right one ...

537
01:07:35,793 --> 01:07:38,746
This kind of shark
does not live here.

538
01:07:39,378 --> 01:07:41,335
Highly unlikely.

539
01:07:47,512 --> 01:07:50,797
I don't mean that
this is not the shark we look for.

540
01:07:51,891 --> 01:07:53,766
I think it is, Martin.

541
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:56,139
He's a man-eater.

542
01:08:14,204 --> 01:08:16,363
Man-eater!

543
01:08:31,932 --> 01:08:35,801
His jaws do not correspond
to the bites on the victim.

544
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:39,182
I want to be sure.
So do you.

545
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:43,020
We all want to be sure,
No?

546
01:08:57,626 --> 01:08:59,203
Anyone else seen them?

547
01:08:59,545 --> 01:09:00,373
No. Nobody.

548
01:09:03,255 --> 01:09:05,082
Bring me the masking tape.

549
01:10:07,153 --> 01:10:09,525
I want you to call me Bruce.

550
01:10:10,155 --> 01:10:11,567
What is Bruce?

551
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:13,363
A name.

552
01:10:14,453 --> 01:10:16,661
When you call me Bruce,
I'll respond

553
01:10:17,247 --> 01:10:19,204
I also want a name like this.

554
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:24,122
Choose a new one.
Whatever you want.

555
01:10:26,006 --> 01:10:28,046
I want to be called Backbone.

556
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:30,717
You can't be called that.

557
01:10:31,054 --> 01:10:32,679
A backbone is a backbone.

558
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:40,801
Bruce!

559
01:10:43,189 --> 01:10:44,221
Bruce!

560
01:10:54,827 --> 01:10:55,739
Bruce!

561
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:00,118
Bruce!

562
01:11:07,672 --> 01:11:12,466
Your house is very nice.
Just as we pictured it.

563
01:11:12,805 --> 01:11:13,884
Thank you.

564
01:11:15,474 --> 01:11:17,051
Where is the perfume
I gave you?

565
01:11:17,391 --> 01:11:18,590
In the bathroom.

566
01:11:19,269 --> 01:11:21,226
It is a very good perfume

567
01:11:21,564 --> 01:11:25,395
My wife insisted that we should buy
that perfume as a present for you

568
01:11:25,733 --> 01:11:27,442
At first, we were thinking
of getting you a vase.

569
01:11:27,778 --> 01:11:31,989
but we thought it would not
find it's place in your house.

570
01:11:34,743 --> 01:11:36,618
You live here alone?

571
01:11:36,954 --> 01:11:39,908
Yes. My parents live on the 4th.

572
01:12:16,243 --> 01:12:20,787
I wish your children get all the
wrong stimuli and grow to be bad.

573
01:12:21,123 --> 01:12:22,868
I wish it with all my heart.

574
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:26,412
Let this be the punishment
for your wrongdoings to my family.

575
01:12:56,408 --> 01:12:58,235
She hit me with a hammer!

576
01:12:58,621 --> 01:13:00,162
He's lying, it wasn't me!

577
01:13:00,497 --> 01:13:04,662
I just saw a cat with a hammer
jumping out the window.

578
01:13:06,127 --> 01:13:07,041
She did it.

579
01:13:07,378 --> 01:13:09,206
The pain makes you delirious.

580
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:12,081
He needs a plaster
and painkillers.

581
01:13:12,425 --> 01:13:14,382
It must be broken, Dad.

582
01:13:24,396 --> 01:13:26,105
Did you do like we said?

583
01:13:26,442 --> 01:13:28,100
You have taken precautions?

584
01:13:28,484 --> 01:13:30,310
He didn't have time, dad.

585
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:33,108
From what i saw
it was a really fast cat.

586
01:13:33,613 --> 01:13:34,989
Very, very fast.

587
01:13:40,078 --> 01:13:43,909
You spend less time
with children.

588
01:13:44,247 --> 01:13:47,534
Don't cry.
The children will see you.

589
01:13:48,712 --> 01:13:50,670
Have you've combed your hair today?

590
01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:53,961
Yes.

591
01:13:58,432 --> 01:14:01,052
I had a hard day.

592
01:14:15,864 --> 01:14:20,029
We'll have to replace Christina.

593
01:14:21,078 --> 01:14:24,329
We can't trust anyone.

594
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:26,908
Nobody should come here anymore.

595
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:29,743
I think about handing the task
to our elder daughter.

596
01:14:30,087 --> 01:14:32,756
Unless we let him
decide for himself.

597
01:14:33,091 --> 01:14:35,215
That's maybe better.

598
01:19:21,009 --> 01:19:24,961
If you do it again,
I'll gut you, you bitch.

599
01:19:28,099 --> 01:19:30,221
I swear on my daughter's life

600
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,095
that you and your gang

601
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:37,274
will soon flee the neighborhood.

602
01:19:46,451 --> 01:19:47,399
Mom!

603
01:19:50,162 --> 01:19:52,618
I found
two little zombies.

604
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:56,252
Should I bring them?

605
01:20:00,881 --> 01:20:01,877
Mom!

606
01:20:06,136 --> 01:20:07,168
Mom!

607
01:21:28,805 --> 01:21:30,216
Today is our wedding anniversary.

608
01:21:30,557 --> 01:21:33,760
To celebrate,
we'll eat cake

609
01:21:34,101 --> 01:21:37,471
and decorate the house
with lights and balloons.

610
01:21:42,028 --> 01:21:43,438
Sit up.

611
01:21:51,203 --> 01:21:53,409
I think my dogtooth is shaky.

612
01:22:00,005 --> 01:22:02,922
I don't think so.
It doesn't even move.

613
01:22:11,806 --> 01:22:14,345
- Did you sleep well last night?
- Great.

614
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:28,260
Dad, I'm tired.
Can I stop now?

615
01:23:28,594 --> 01:23:31,050
Yes, my darling, if you can't keep on.

616
01:25:01,898 --> 01:25:03,060
Enough!

617
01:28:54,926 --> 01:28:57,417
Dad, you'll give me
the spear gun?

618
01:28:59,095 --> 01:29:01,717
I've already said,
it is dangerous.

619
01:29:02,307 --> 01:29:04,051
I can lick you ear
if you want.

620
01:30:48,332 --> 01:30:49,113
Bruce!

621
01:30:52,837 --> 01:30:54,034
Bruce!

622
01:31:40,679 --> 01:31:42,338
I'll go get the dog tomorrow.

623
01:31:43,555 --> 01:31:46,306
The 5th stage of training
must be completed by now.

624
01:31:53,899 --> 01:31:57,564
Either drink your orange juice
while it's fresh or don't drink it at all.
