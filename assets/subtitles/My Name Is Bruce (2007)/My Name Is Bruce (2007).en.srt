1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,856
In the mining town of Gold Lick
the year was 1870.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,200
The Chinese came to work and
rid themselves of poverty.

3
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,360
Then one night it happened,
the disaster struck.

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,780
A rumble from below,
the Chinese were stuck.

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,290
An old Chinaman prayed
all the loved ones he's so cherished.

6
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,600
Asking the Saint of curd to
protect to souls who perished.

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,590
Guan-Di is his name.

8
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,100
Guan-Di is his name.

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,500
Guan-You, Guan-Me, Guan-Di.

10
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:10,000
Guan-Di is his name.

11
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,420
WELCOME TO GOLD LICK
POPULATION 339

12
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,285
Bull's-eye, yeah.

13
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,217
- Here, have a swig, man.
- No, it's okay. Thanks.

14
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,660
Come on, it's just beer, you pussy,
have a drink.

15
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,322
All right, fine.

16
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,571
- I love beer.
- Yeah, I can tell.

17
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,173
I thought I told you to ditch
all this monster movie crap.

18
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,248
- What's wrong with it?
- Jesus, Jeff.

19
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,782
When are you gonna grow up?

20
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,146
Getting you laid is hard enough

21
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,915
without having to explain
the whole Bruce Campbell factor.

22
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,456
What's wrong with Bruce Campbell?

23
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,426
Death of the Dead?

24
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,859
Maniac Cop?

25
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,126
Moonwarp?

26
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,931
Bruce Campbell is the greatest actor
of his generation!

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,099
Man with the Screaming Brain.

28
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,369
Alien Apocalypse.

29
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,071
Oh, here's a good one, Cave Alien.

30
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,613
That is a good one!

31
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,149
Yeah, "Bruce Campbell is
Lieutenant Jack Stryker,

32
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:35,551
"a rogue clone warrior and mankind's
last hope against the deadly cave aliens."

33
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,350
Yeah. So?

34
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:41,223
Dude, forget thumbs, Ebert wouldn't
wipe his crack with this trash.

35
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,419
Get out of the car.

36
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,089
- What?
- You don't like Bruce, you walk!

37
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,063
Hey, take it easy, man.

38
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,831
Besides, I kind of liked Bubba Ho-tep.

39
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,371
Everyone liked Bubba Ho-tep!

40
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,770
Calm down.

41
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,369
Okay. All right, fine.

42
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:04,239
- Now, can we please go get laid?
- All right.

43
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,373
Holy shit.

44
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,823
Boo!

45
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:45,913
Dick!

46
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,789
Dude,
just fucking with you. Come on.

47
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,658
What the hell?

48
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,046
You scream like a girl.

49
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,145
Jeff, Little Debbie.

50
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,383
Hey.

51
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,119
Clayton, Big Debbie.

52
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,354
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,728
Come on, let's go check out
this creepy graveyard.

54
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,865
When I told the mascara queen
about this old graveyard,

55
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,803
- she practically dry humped me on the spot.
Yeah.

56
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,273
- She's sort of cute.
- Yeah. Don't worry, hard on.

57
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,708
Morticia's all yours.

58
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,747
I'm gonna go practice my human fly
on little Miss Skyscraper over there.

59
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,492
- Hey.
- Hi.

60
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:58,223
They look ancient, historic.

61
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,665
Yeah, these graves have been around
since the cave-in of...

62
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,498
A long time ago.

63
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,198
Must have meant a lot to these people.

64
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,675
Let's break something.

65
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,480
As long as it's not my heart.

66
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,514
What do you say?
Give me some sugar, baby.

67
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,550
- What?
- Hey, look.

68
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,944
We can play the hard to get all night,

69
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:26,617
but if this game's called eye-tag,
your lips say I'm it.

70
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,490
Your loss, baby.

71
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,828
Your loss.

72
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:46,072
So, why haven't I seen you around school?

73
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,739
- That's 'cause I'm never there.
- Cool.

74
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,977
- You seeing anybody?
- No.

75
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,144
Cool.

76
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,149
Groovy.

77
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,320
Christ! Shit!

78
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,972
Run! Get the hell out of here!

79
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,166
Freak.

80
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,347
Shit, Clayton, run!

81
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,252
Yeah, right, Romeo.

82
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,060
Shit!

83
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,001
- What's up with that fucking lightning?
- That's heat lightning, baby.

84
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,992
- Jeff, don't leave me!
- Come on, Clayton, run!

85
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,222
Jeff! Jeff, don't leave me, man!

86
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,763
Come on, man!

87
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,833
Don't fucking leave me!

88
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,032
No! No!

89
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,700
Shit!

90
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,581
What did I do?

91
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,348
What did I do?

92
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,759
Hold it right there.

93
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,435
What's wrong with you, Stryker?
We've got the cave alien cornered.

94
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,528
Okay, so transmit the scans
up to Delta Baker,

95
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,107
plant some bio blasters
and send out for Chinese.

96
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,143
- Colonel Parker's still trapped down there.
- Cry me a river, toots.

97
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:36,011
Last time I ran into Colonel Parker,
he had me in front of a firing squad!

98
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,678
Coward!

99
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,412
I should have left you on Regula Nine.

100
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,256
You know you couldn't do that, baby.

101
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,656
Yeah. That's right.

102
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,220
You knew they built me
out of your old man's DNA, don't you?

103
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:55,926
So I say we keep in the family
and start swapping some spit, ASAP.

104
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,435
- You're disgusting.
- I'm a man.

105
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,996
And I've wanted to do this
ever since we landed on this rock.

106
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,547
Damn it! We're surrounded!

107
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,289
Behind you! Look out!

108
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,759
Get down!

109
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,190
Watch out, watch out!
Take him out! Take him out!

110
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,599
Can't you die?

111
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,004
Cut! Cut!

112
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,207
Cut!

113
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,352
- Dude, light me, don't fight me.
- Hey, bite me.

114
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,021
Bruce, that was sweet.

115
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,498
Don't you think it was just,
I don't know, a little over the top?

116
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,264
No, no, no. It was very Caligula
meets The Apple Dumpling Gang.

117
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,633
That's not an answer.

118
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,674
It was perfect for Cave Alien 2. Moving on!

119
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:16,239
Hey, Tiny,
fetch me another lemon water, will you?

120
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,318
- They just ran out, man.
- Well, then, dude, you run out, capiche?

121
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,113
Come on, now.

122
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,321
Nice job, baby.

123
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,621
I'll tell you, what a relief,
on these down-and-dirty shows,

124
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:30,923
to be working with a pro.

125
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,588
I wouldn't know.

126
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,695
Good.

127
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,739
God damn it. "Get me some lemon water.
Give me some sugar, baby."

128
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,671
Perfect.

129
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,938
Get a load of this, bitch.

130
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,316
Hey, I know this bar off Cahuenga
where the drinks are cheap,

131
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,388
and, well, I'll be there.

132
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,357
Hello?

133
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,654
Oh, hello.

134
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,957
No, you're not interrupting anything.

135
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,793
At least think it over.

136
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,424
Mr. Campbell, that refreshing lemon water
you asked for, sir.

137
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,264
Thanks.

138
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,359
Hey.

139
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,699
- This is warm.
- Sir, I'm sorry.

140
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,835
I'll make sure you get an ice-cold case
of it in your trailer by the morning.

141
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,242
All right.

142
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,715
You're lucky. See to it.

143
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,785
Man, that's good.

144
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,316
Boo.

145
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,724
You're on.

146
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,534
Hey, guys, how you doing? Here you go.
One for you. One for you.

147
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,103
- Mr. Campbell? Mr. Campbell?
- Yeah.

148
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,764
When you were in Army of Darkness,
when you were stuck down in the pit,

149
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,101
how did you get your shotgun back?

150
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,573
Talk to the writer, man, I don't know.

151
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,371
Hey, when you worked with Ellen,
did it turn you gay?

152
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,968
No, but your stupid question did.

153
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,570
Why did you do Serving Sara?

154
00:11:55,681 --> 00:12:00,914
Why did I do Serving Sara?
For the money, mouth breather, why else?

155
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,716
For the love of God, what is that stench?

156
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,416
Here, it's called deodorant.
Look it up on your Internets.

157
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,155
See you, boys. Late for a soirée.

158
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,254
- Hey, Mr. Campbell?
- Yeah.

159
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,230
Give me your autograph.

160
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,097
- Got a pen?
- Why, you ain't got no pen?

161
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,700
- What's your name?
- Gerard.

162
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:27,770
Okay.

163
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,445
Here you go, Gerard.
Have a good one, buddy.

164
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,712
Yeah, hey, hey, hey.
That's Gerard with a "G."

165
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,724
Here you go, Gerard.
Have a good one, buddy.

166
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:45,991
Yeah, hey, Mr. Campbell, come on.
You got a more recent picture than this?

167
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,326
Let me ask you something.

168
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,025
- Ever see Rawhide?
- Yeah.

169
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,432
- You like it?
- Yeah.

170
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,800
Well, then you know
you gotta keep them doggies rolling.

171
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,202
Hey!

172
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,374
Freak.

173
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,064
Nice rack.

174
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,632
All right!

175
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,466
Yeah, baby!

176
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,681
Yo, baby cakes, how about a bourbon
with a loaded revolver back?

177
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,274
How about you wait your turn, jerk?

178
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,213
There's more where that came from.
Okay. All right. That's it.

179
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,191
Good girl.

180
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,794
You. You, give me some sugar, baby. You.

181
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,295
Okay.

182
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,798
Huh?

183
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,865
- How you doing?
- Good. Good.

184
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,339
- Hey, good news.
- Yeah?

185
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,706
Yeah, I made the trades today.

186
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,335
- Really?
- Yeah, check the obituaries.

187
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,778
You'll find my career there.

188
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,407
You know, Bruce, I just talked to the studio.

189
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,284
They saw the dailies for Cave Alien 2.
They said you have never been better.

190
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,822
Yeah, that's because
unlike most action stars,

191
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,916
I can speak... What's the word? English.

192
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,120
- Will that be cash?
- Oh, yeah, that'll be cash, all right.

193
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,028
My friend and agent, Mr. Mills Toddner, here
will take care of that.

194
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,600
That's perfect. You keep the change.
Don't be a stranger.

195
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,432
- Sure, it's a special occasion.
- Yeah, it's a special occasion.

196
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,904
It's the night I fire your polyester ass.

197
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,067
Bruce, I'm sensing a little hostility
coming this way.

198
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,940
Yeah? You think so?
Maybe that's because I've spent

199
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:44,379
the last six days of my life making a sequel
to one of the crappiest movies ever.

200
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,815
- You make lots of crappy movies.
- Oh, that doesn't help.

201
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,580
Liquor! Liquor, please!

202
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,781
Look, the customer reviews
on Amazon were great.

203
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,587
Yeah, the ones you posted.

204
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:58,424
BC, I sense that you wanna unload.

205
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,022
I sense that you have a lot on your mind.

206
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,762
So, I'm here. Give it to me.

207
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,298
It's just that I think that...

208
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,972
Excuse me. Gotta take this.

209
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,611
Go on. I'm sorry.

210
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,917
It's just that I think I'm losing my muse.
Do you know what I mean?

211
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:33,328
The childlike, innocent quality
that all great artists tap to create.

212
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:38,131
Now, if an actor's life is like a painting,
then it's a work in progress.

213
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:42,606
But how can I create my great masterpiece
if my paint is drying up,

214
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,902
my canvas is cracked

215
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,274
and all my brushes
are covered with a fake monster blood?

216
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,676
- It's Cheryl, isn't it?
- No.

217
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,009
- It's Cheryl.
- I said no.

218
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,049
- You can't stop thinking about her.
- lf I say no three times,

219
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,379
will the Candyman come out?

220
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,817
You were fired before,
you're twice as fired now.

221
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:59,482
Okay, you'll never know
what I got you for your birthday.

222
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,957
My birthday?

223
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,893
You actually remembered my birthday?

224
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:08,125
Compadre, hello. Loco.

225
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:12,636
I am your agent.
You are my number one client.

226
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,698
- lf this is another Matthew Perry movie...
- Better.

227
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,777
- Give me a hint.
- But you fired me so...

228
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,209
God damn it, Mills! Just tell me.

229
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,339
Okay.

230
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:28,785
Let's just say this is gonna be the best
birthday present you've ever had.

231
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,047
- Nice.
- You're crazy.

232
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,679
- No, you are.
- We're celebrating.

233
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,451
I love you, man. How about it?

234
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,125
Excuse me. I gotta take this. Sorry.

235
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,354
Hello?

236
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,168
Movie. Movie, movie.

237
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,674
This bean curd's kind of watery and gross.

238
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,751
Well, you did get
the winning goal, didn't you?

239
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,218
- Yeah.
- Finish your bean curd.

240
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,913
It's still gross.

241
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,288
- What was that, Mom?
- I'm not sure, Skippy. You stay here.

242
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,317
Must die!

243
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,863
Sorry.

244
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,017
I don't know why I'm complaining.

245
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,351
I'm a lucky guy.

246
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,015
I've got my health.

247
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,987
Jesus!

248
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,961
My divorce is final.

249
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,998
Lousy whore.

250
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,332
And I got my loyal fans,
who hated my last movie.

251
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,065
Hated my last five movies. Yeah.

252
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,768
Me and my wonderful, wonderful fans.

253
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,404
That was easy.

254
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,274
Hey, buddy.

255
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,477
Hey, little Sam'nRob.

256
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,850
Come here, boy. Come on.

257
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,818
What's the matter?

258
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,760
You thought I forgot about you,
didn't you, huh?

259
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,161
Time for some hooch. Come on!

260
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,893
Hooch for the pooch.

261
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:36,403
There you go. And some for Dad.

262
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,082
What's on the boob tube?

263
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:55,450
And now part nine of
an ongoing, exclusive, investigative series.

264
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,529
Oh, who wants to watch that horseshit?

265
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,563
Next, we take a scary look

266
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,499
at the life and times of B-movie horror star
Bruce Campbell.

267
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,399
Hey, I know that guy.

268
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,769
Yeah, that's entertainment. I'll drink to that.

269
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,640
Campbell, best known for his parts
in the horrific Evil Dead films,

270
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,440
appears to have disappeared
from the entertainment scene.

271
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,283
What?

272
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,978
Tonight, our "Where Are They Now"
reporter, Charlie Payne,

273
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,679
takes an affectionate look back

274
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:28,453
on a promising career that many feel
was squandered on low-budget trash.

275
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,255
You shut your face.

276
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,130
They're treating me like I'm a has-been!

277
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,835
Like I'm... Like I'm all washed up.

278
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:54,851
They're trying to make me look pathetic.
Yeah, they are. Not me.

279
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,313
Not me!

280
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,702
Oh, God.

281
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:22,113
- Hello?
- Hello, Cheryl. It's me.

282
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:29,051
- Bruce, what now?
- Oh, I was just, you know,

283
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,055
celebrating the almost wrap
of my latest movie.

284
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,092
You know, just one more day.

285
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,161
You got into the dog's bowl again,
didn't you?

286
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,092
Shut up, you selfish mutt!

287
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,496
It's your birthday, isn't it?

288
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:47,470
Every year,
it's the same old "poor me" routine.

289
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:51,338
Oh, come on, can't a guy get bombed
and call his ex-wife at 3:00 in the morning

290
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,707
without it meaning something?

291
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,838
Bruce, I talked to Mills today.

292
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,883
Yeah? What did
old "Ten Percent" have to say?

293
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,215
Oh, just that you were depressed.

294
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,322
So he's planning something special
for your birthday.

295
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,155
Yeah? Did he say what?

296
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,819
No, no. It's a surprise.

297
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:15,423
Oh, come on, Cheryl. Tell me.
Tell me, please, please, Cheryl.

298
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,401
- I'm hanging up.
- No, no, no, don't. Don't, baby!

299
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,669
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,037
How did things get so messed up
between us?

301
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,243
Oh...

302
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,937
You slept with the dog sitter, Bruce.

303
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:30,105
One lousy mistake.

304
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,275
- All of them.
- Okay, 12 lousy mistakes.

305
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,446
But come on, baby. I was confused then.
I'm fine now.

306
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,520
God, I miss you and the kids.

307
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,387
What kids?

308
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,293
The ones we would have had
if you'd just hung on!

309
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,764
You wanna know the truth about us, Bruce?

310
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,768
It wasn't the cheating, or the boozing,

311
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,169
or even the endless whining
that killed our marriage.

312
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,865
You just couldn't commit,

313
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:01,241
to your career, to our relationship,
to much of anything.

314
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,873
So, the cheating, boozing
and endless whining were okay?

315
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,756
- Who was that, baby?
- Oh, nobody.

316
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:19,592
Come on, Millsy, introduce me
to big Jim one more time.

317
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,996
I already set up the meeting.

318
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,464
Let me make a call.

319
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,909
What could you possibly want
at 4:30 in the morning?

320
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,420
- Mr. Campbell, we need your help.
- I need my sleep.

321
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,754
Sir, Gold Lick needs you.

322
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,828
A group of teenagers
unwittingly unleashed Guan-Di,

323
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,830
the Chinese god of war
and protector of the dead.

324
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,992
And unless you help us stop him,
he will kill every one of us.

325
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,435
Okay, settle down.
I'm gonna give you some advice, okay?

326
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,406
Keep it under a-million-and-half,
get one name actor,

327
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,671
and if you go straight to DVD,
you might break even.

328
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,939
- Now, fuck off!
- Mr. Campbell!

329
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,211
Oh, man, I've heard
some lame pitches in my day,

330
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,115
but that takes the cake.

331
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,184
I said get lost, you little...

332
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,294
Huh. A quarter.

333
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,522
What the hell?

334
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,627
Hey! Hey, let me out of here!

335
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,198
Mr. Campbell, are you okay?

336
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,799
- Who... Who are you?
- This is Jeff.

337
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,142
Look, I'm sorry about
the whole baseball bat thing.

338
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:53,043
Look, I left some Twinkies back there.

339
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,953
And there's a flashlight next to the spare.

340
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:03,190
Oh, I also left an empty bottle back there,
if you need to, you know...

341
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,861
Look, Mr. Campbell,
I know you're probably tired and sore,

342
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,435
and suffering from a concussion,

343
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:15,028
but is it true you're making a sequel
to Cave Alien?

344
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,041
Oh, my God. He's a fan.

345
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,873
It finally happened.

346
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,175
Help! Help!

347
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,643
Oh, for God's sake, kid,
at least go easy on the bumps!

348
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,018
I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell, I'll do my best.

349
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,741
- Gin.
- Dang it.

350
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,174
That's three in a row, Edna.

351
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,546
- What was that, Hank?
- I don't know.

352
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,507
Sounded like something out by the barn.

353
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,461
You close that door. You lock it.

354
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,500
But, Hank,
what if you need to come back in?

355
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,560
You just close that door,
and don't open it, no matter what you hear!

356
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,008
Oh, Lord! Lord!

357
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:37,749
Open the door! Open the door, Edna!

358
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,552
But, Hank, you said don't open the door!

359
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,025
For Christ's sake, woman,
we've been married for 35 years!

360
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,255
Open the goddamn door!

361
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,728
Got you!

362
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,267
There weren't nothing out there.
I was just funning with you.

363
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:55,430
You old fool,
I can't believe you got me like that.

364
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,531
You should have seen the look on your face.

365
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,720
"Hey, Luigi, paint the sign."

366
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,759
I tell you something,
you paint the damn sign.

367
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,487
But I do.

368
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,035
Hmm.

369
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,844
I paint a beauty sign.

370
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:16,482
Hip-hip hurray! Hip-hip hurray!
Hip-hip hurray!

371
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,886
Welcome to Gold Lick, Mr. Campbell!

372
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:23,225
- Gold Lick? Where the fuck is Gold Lick?
- Hey, easy, man. That's the mayor.

373
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,626
I don't give a shit
if he's the king of kiss-my-assy.

374
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,292
I just spent the last six hours in a trunk
and I want some answers chop-chop, and I...

375
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,866
Well, hello.

376
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,815
Consider yourself officially exempt
from my wrath, sweet cakes.

377
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:50,479
And if you're lucky, a little later,
I'll let you play with my boom stick.

378
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,146
What?

379
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:57,718
Now, I don't imagine you get
moving pictures here in this farthole,

380
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,820
so let me explain something.

381
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,728
What you just did,

382
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,030
you just kidnapped a movie star,
you got that?

383
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,696
So you didn't just
commit a crime against me,

384
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,933
which was pretty freaking huge!

385
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,976
You committed a crime against art itself.

386
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:17,912
In fact, I was due back on the set
of my latest motion picture hours ago,

387
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,916
and you can bet your bottom dollar

388
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:23,112
they're gonna be doing everything they can
to get me back.

389
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,190
What are we waiting for?

390
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,290
A- hole Campbell didn't show up.
On to plan B, my friend.

391
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,156
Okay, people, big energy. Let's go!

392
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,459
Action!

393
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,698
That's good.

394
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:47,509
So as much as I'd love to hang around here

395
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,877
until the FBI rips you grit-eaters
a new one...

396
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:55,146
Mr. Campbell, I don't understand.
Your agent said you were free.

397
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,278
What does my agent
have to do with any of this?

398
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:01,586
Well, he just said not to book you
on your birthday, or something like that.

399
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,058
My birthday?

400
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,063
My birthday.

401
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,294
My birthday, that's it.

402
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,338
Mills, you magnificent bastard.

403
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,536
When you said there was a surprise in store,
holy moley...

404
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,077
That's a great tie, by the way.

405
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,108
I gotta make a phone call. I'll be right back.

406
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,740
Don't do anything quaint until I return.

407
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,621
Mills Toddner's office.
- Yes, Mills Toddner, please.

408
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,132
- Who's calling?
- Bruce Campbell.

409
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,361
- Who?
- Bruce Campbell.

410
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,337
- He's not here. Voicemail okay?
- Yeah, voicemail is fine.

411
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,704
Mills, thrill me.
- Mills, listen, Campbell here.

412
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,174
I gotta tell you, pal,

413
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,540
this is, without a doubt,

414
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,046
the most outrageous birthday present
I've ever gotten.

415
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,638
So thanks, man.

416
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,846
You're beautiful, and that whole firing thing,
what are you, crazy? It's a joke, come on.

417
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,682
Now, I know you guys
probably can't break character,

418
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,556
but I gotta tell you,

419
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,722
man, you really had me going.
You really did.

420
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,061
- I don't understand.
- Well, for a minute there,

421
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,294
I thought I was in the sequel
of Deliverance, you know,

422
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,598
and someone was about to say,
"Squeal like a pig, boy."

423
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,477
Yes, there's no reason
beating around the bush,

424
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,943
and I realize this is rather unorthodox but...

425
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:32,380
Say no more, Mr. Mayor.
My hero senses are tingling.

426
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,012
I sense that the town of Gold Lick
is in trouble.

427
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,319
Huh? Big trouble and you need my help.

428
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:42,618
Hmm?

429
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,888
Do you? You need my help, Mr. Mayor?

430
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:46,190
- Yes or no?
- That's exactly right.

431
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,424
How about that?
Put the words right in your mouth, didn't I?

432
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,024
But not just any help, huh?

433
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,330
You need someone special,

434
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,872
someone who can take on
a heinous monster

435
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,705
and stop him in his tracks
and take him to justice.

436
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,369
That would be me. Whoa!

437
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,008
Mr. Mayor, your worries are over

438
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,780
'cause there's a new sheriff in town
and he's gonna clean up this mess.

439
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:13,323
Gold Lick, it's a good day. I'm here to help!

440
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,392
Let's hear it for Mr. Bruce Campbell.

441
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:20,453
Hip-hip hurray! Hip-hip hurray!
Hip-hip hurray!

442
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,728
Now, it's just another day
in the life of a hero.

443
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,532
Mr. Mayor, tell us what's next.

444
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,165
We'd like to show you
exactly what you're up against.

445
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:06,176
Leather, red leather, yellow leather,
red, yellow, red leather, yellow leather.

446
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,869
Ow!

447
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,313
- My foot!
- Pardon me there, Gomer Pyle.

448
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,851
- Jesus!
- Oh, excuse me, Goober.

449
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,318
Boy, this is exciting, huh?

450
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,018
- Think they'll give me the key to the city?
- I doubt it.

451
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,821
How about the key to your place?

452
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:27,091
I'm sorry, we haven't met. I'm Kelly Graham.

453
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:30,565
Graham? Well, I'll bet all the boys
go cracker over you.

454
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,294
That was funny when I was six.

455
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,965
Well, I was six once.
Hey, we already have something in common.

456
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:43,107
Oh, heck. I'm... I'm Bruce. Bruce Campbell.

457
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:47,048
Yes, I'm well aware of that.
Jeff's been bragging about you for years.

458
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,243
Ah...

459
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:51,549
- Uber fan's connected to you, huh?
- I'm afraid so.

460
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,589
- Younger brother?
- Son.

461
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:59,561
- Young mother.
- It's a country thing.

462
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,097
Oh, hey, a MILF is a MILF.

463
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,760
But I don't see a wedding ring.

464
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,065
Are you married or happy, Kelly Graham?

465
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,039
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
answering that.

466
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,474
Mr. Campbell, if you're ready.

467
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,945
Yeah, knock yourself out, chief.
Showtime, huh?

468
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,744
Mr. Treppin, let's start the slide show.

469
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:27,414
As we all know,
Gold Lick is a mining community.

470
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,151
In the late 1850s,

471
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:36,597
hundreds of Chinese immigrants
came to our shores to help work the claims.

472
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,700
At her height, the Triple-T mine

473
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,676
employed hundreds
of Chinese immigrant laborers.

474
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:51,009
They worked long hours,
in primitive conditions,

475
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,913
surviving on rice and bean curd.

476
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:56,653
Oh!

477
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,698
Then disaster struck.

478
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:15,965
You want disaster?

479
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,041
Anyone here seen Assault on Dome 4?

480
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,201
- That's probably my favorite movie...
- Don't answer that.

481
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,074
A mine shaft cave-in.

482
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:28,083
Over a hundred Chinese were buried alive
and remain there today.

483
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:32,420
Gold Lick has never been the same since.

484
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,292
That guy's pretty good.
Did he come from dinner theater?

485
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,793
No, Iowa.

486
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,165
You know, they go to all that trouble
to kidnap somebody,

487
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:45,861
I'd have kidnapped that Jake character
from Evil Dead II.

488
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,336
My money'd bet on that blacksmith
from Army of Darkness.

489
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,101
- Now, that's one stud.
- Damn straight.

490
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,845
I wish I could quit you.

491
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,915
Soon after,
rumors began to spread of a curse.

492
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,216
Okay. When did my ex-wife start modeling?

493
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,086
Mom, that's it. That's the thing.

494
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:10,558
Legend has it that
a Chinese demon was summoned

495
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,892
to protect the spirits
of all those who had died.

496
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,292
Mom.

497
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,799
A warning.

498
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,140
He who would confront Guan-Di,

499
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:33,744
would also confront death itself.

500
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:37,950
- Well, hello, Mr. Plaitpoint.
- His name is Wing.

501
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:41,991
He's one of the last surviving descendents
of the dead laborers.

502
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:46,029
Guan-Di has been unleashed from his grave.

503
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,698
I'm sorry, was that "unreashed"?

504
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,529
Unleashed, unleashed.

505
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,503
What's the matter?
Don't you speak English?

506
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:59,269
Guan-Di, great warrior.
Guan-Di, protector of dead,

507
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:04,144
savior of the innocent and the bean curd.

508
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,777
Bean curd? What...

509
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,980
Bean curd's a popular Chinese dish. You...

510
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,989
You chatter like monkey.

511
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,616
I call you Chattering Monkey.

512
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,564
His grave has been disturbed.

513
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,196
And Guan-Di will not stop
until every last relative

514
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,471
of the one who did this
lay rotting in the earth.

515
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:37,035
Well, hell, what could be so bad about that?

516
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,844
Okay, blood relatives, raise your hand.

517
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:44,580
Guan-Di knows that you and I
are not related, right?

518
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:48,185
I shall do an ancient Chinese dance,

519
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:51,784
which will rid you all
of the curse of Guan-Di.

520
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,240
Has he been dispelled? No?

521
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,674
Okay, you're all going to die.

522
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,677
But know this,

523
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:12,681
Guan-Di grows stronger
with every person he kills,

524
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:17,379
until all of you will die!

525
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,860
Will die!

526
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,825
He's gone!

527
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,906
No, no. Actually, he's... He's right...

528
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:42,635
Well, folks, it looks like
the presentation is over.

529
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:47,684
Just be careful on your way home,
and look out for your neighbors.

530
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,485
Boy, that was exciting.

531
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:58,193
As you can see, Mr. Campbell,
the future of Gold Lick rests in your hands.

532
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,092
We sure appreciate you being here.

533
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,859
We were thinking you might want
to freshen up and get a bite to eat

534
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,366
before you lead us into battle.

535
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,231
Mr. Mayor, that's a good idea.

536
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:10,000
'Cause I always freshen up
before I go into battle and kill monsters.

537
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:14,134
- You don't want to leave a bad impression.
- Lordy, you're good people.

538
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,117
You're welcome to wash up at my tavern.

539
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,516
Well, that's good 'cause,
as you can see, I'm a dirty little boy.

540
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:26,385
Oh, oh, yeah,
and I've got a nice little place upstairs.

541
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,050
You can wait there until dinner
and no one will hassle you or anything.

542
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,993
Well, Jeff, if you insist.

543
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,408
I'd say the only thing missing
is the stool sample.

544
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,951
- Yeah, I guess I am kind of a fan.
- Yeah, do you think?

545
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:34,654
- That's not familiar.
- Hey, hey. That's personal.

546
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:38,489
Look, Mr. Campbell,
I fixed you up a room back here.

547
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,997
I gave you some fresh towels
and clothes and...

548
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,000
Look, I know this is
a big imposition for you so

549
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:48,833
whatever I can do to make feel you at home,
just let me know, okay?

550
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:55,568
First of all, kid, Mr. Campbell makes soup.
My name is Bruce.

551
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,408
Secondly, you wanna get on my good side,

552
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,575
you'll dig up a bar of soap
and a bottle of Jack,

553
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,981
and not in that order.

554
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,256
Nothing like a shower
to wash the blues away.

555
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,560
Jeff, where the heck
did you find this Evil Dead shampoo?

556
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,758
Bruce, that's drain cleaner.

557
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,062
Oh...

558
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:22,195
Maybe that would explain
the burning sensation.

559
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,003
What?

560
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,373
Well, it's just that
you're going up against Guan-Di tonight

561
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,949
and you're not even scared.

562
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,814
You don't know fear, kid.
You never worked with Sam Raimi.

563
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,220
You know, compared to most hell spawn,
this Guan-Di cat's no biggie-mo.

564
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,814
- Really?
- Nah.

565
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,587
You know, in the hero business,

566
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,787
you only really
have to remember two things.

567
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,922
One, most monsters
are just a guy in a rubber suit.

568
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:52,059
Two, you can't fight a guy in a rubber suit
on an empty stomach.

569
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:55,297
So this particular hero
needs some food and some drink.

570
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,518
There's Bruce Campbell.

571
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,230
- Pick your poison, Mr. Campbell.
- Oh, I hardly ever touch the stuff.

572
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,927
- It's on the house.
- Well, in that case,

573
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,732
I'll take a slow screw against the wall
and make it a double.

574
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,534
Maybe this is all a big joke to you,

575
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,165
but Jeff's talked the whole town
into thinking

576
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,267
you're gonna save us from this Guan-Di.

577
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,572
Yeah, and?

578
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,341
And as far as I can tell,
you're pretty much full of shit.

579
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,383
Sounds to me like
you're wandering from the script, sister.

580
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,748
Didn't you read the fine print?
Never piss off the hero.

581
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,844
Hey, hey, Kelly's been known
to speak her mind.

582
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,516
Sounds to me like she needs to be recast.
She adlibs too much.

583
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,821
Walk with me, Mr. Campbell.
Walk, walk with me.

584
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,294
You know, if I wanted to take shit
from a bunch of bogus actors,

585
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,024
I'd go back to LA.

586
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,192
- Get that out of my face.
- Sure, sure, I understand, Mr. Campbell.

587
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,099
But you see,
Kelly's been through a rough patch.

588
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,173
Her whining, cheating, boozing husband
left her and Jeff in the lurch,

589
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,968
and she just hasn't been herself lately.

590
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,042
Go ahead and have a seat.

591
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:10,013
We're gonna treat you so many ways,
you're bound to like one.

592
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,809
And we appreciate you being here.

593
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,315
Yeah, you could have spelled
my name right.

594
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,485
Hey, Kelly, like it or not,
that man is our salvation.

595
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,653
Good gravy, you've got to play ball.

596
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,163
He's talking like he's crazy,
like none of this is real.

597
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,757
You know, great warriors are often
on a different plane than you and I.

598
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,427
Service, please.

599
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,334
Eccentricity is often the brother
to greatness.

600
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,002
And obnoxiousness is often the brother
of a black eye.

601
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,409
Oh, I admit, he is bit of an odd duck,

602
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,041
but hopefully, he'll be gone lickety-split
and we can get back to our normal life.

603
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,482
I just hope you're right.

604
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,849
Could it possibly get worse?

605
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:52,751
May I have another sarsaparilla?

606
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,976
Ding, ding. Can you fill her up, buddy?

607
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:24,277
Oh, for crying out loud.

608
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,748
Hey, sometime today would be great.

609
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,329
Hey, you old ball sack,
I've been honking for you.

610
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:38,992
I want some gas.

611
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:46,804
Oh, I got you.

612
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,936
You're still upset
about your little sister, Wanda.

613
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:54,575
Well, truth is, it was late, she was Ionely,

614
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,880
and I was using my wrong head.

615
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:06,494
Jesus Christ.

616
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,031
Please!

617
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,513
Can't a guy get something to eat
around here?

618
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,720
Time for some dancing.

619
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:41,258
Ma'am, may I have this dance?

620
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:43,799
- Do you believe in reincarnation?
- Why?

621
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,233
Because it's not gonna happen
in this lifetime.

622
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,772
Well, there's a cold wind blowing
in Gold Lick tonight.

623
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,801
What's the matter?
Can't you take a joke, Mr. Actor Boy?

624
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,747
I'd love to dance with you.

625
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,819
- Do you really mean that?
- Like my life depended on it.

626
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,825
Now, I've gotta warn you,
I'm not a very good dancer.

627
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,458
Oh, I'll bet all you country girls
say the same thing.

628
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,662
Come on, show me some stuff.

629
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:24,735
Hey!

630
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,934
Whoa!

631
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,106
Hey!

632
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,444
Why, you weren't kidding. You really suck.

633
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,681
Oh, well, let's see how the city boy fares.

634
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,486
All right. Yeah. Round we go!

635
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,356
Watch us go!

636
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,028
You all right, honey?

637
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:54,933
I've heard of break dancing,
but this is ridiculous.

638
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,131
Oh, I hope you're a better actor
than you are a dancer.

639
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,970
Obviously, I have no idea what I'm doing.

640
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,409
- Maybe we should try something together.
- You better lead.

641
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,878
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

642
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,215
Hey, everybody, we're dancing!

643
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,762
Hey, lady, 10 cents a ride, no exceptions.

644
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,790
- Hey, what was that?
- Nothing.

645
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,392
Oh, no. Corners of your mouth
turned up at the edges.

646
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:28,562
There's an old Indian saying
for that phenomena.

647
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:35,335
That's Cherokee for "She who smiles at one
she no longer continues to hate."

648
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,379
Oh, shut up and dance.

649
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:47,414
Well, I don't know about you,
but I could use some fresh air.

650
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,687
- Oh, me, too, and just fresh air.
- Of course.

651
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:56,029
Even after everything that's happened,
God, I love this place.

652
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:59,660
Yeah, I grew up in a town just like it.
Little Place in Michigan.

653
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,397
- Ever hear of it?
- Michigan?

654
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:05,032
- No, Little Place, it's just north of Flint.
- Oh, sounds nice.

655
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,440
I made my first movie there
when I was still in high school.

656
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:08,602
Really?

657
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,942
Oh, we were young and naive,

658
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,848
and we wanted to make a movie
that represented our hopes and dreams.

659
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,978
- What was it called?
- Blade of the Skull Ripper.

660
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:21,751
- That's when I got the acting bug.
- Oh, you've come a long way since then.

661
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,792
You haven't seen much of my recent stuff,
I guess.

662
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,692
Well, believe it or not,
Jeff has shown me a couple.

663
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:30,324
I don't know about the plots,
but you're usually pretty good in them.

664
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:34,370
- You really mean that?
- I wouldn't say it if I didn't.

665
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,099
Well, you're just full of surprises,
aren't you, Kelly Graham?

666
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,175
Well, here's one for you.

667
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:45,437
I actually think I'm a little shy.
That's why I come on so strong.

668
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,313
Oh, hey, I came on kind of strong myself.

669
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,581
It's not easy for me to...

670
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,283
Yes?

671
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,826
...express my true feelings.

672
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,324
You want to move that hand?

673
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:13,572
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- Yeah, well, I'll let it slide, this time.

674
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,308
Mr. Campbell.

675
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,684
Sure, Mr. Mayor, of course.
Just give me five minutes.

676
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:26,778
It's time.

677
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,586
For the love of God,
I can smell her ChapStick!

678
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,022
I'm so gonna take a rain check.

679
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,827
All right, come on.

680
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,740
All right, small-town America,
show me what you got.

681
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,834
Well, no matter which way you wanna go,
Mr. Campbell,

682
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:51,345
- I think we got you covered.
- All right.

683
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:54,576
You might want to slip
this little Beretta.22 in your pocket.

684
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:57,915
It's for that close range,
last-minute desperation stuff.

685
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,886
- What's your name?
- Frank.

686
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,322
Frank, nice gun, for a girl.

687
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:05,224
- You want to step it up a bit, do you?
- Hello.

688
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:10,096
This.45 long-slide "Widow Maker."

689
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,768
I think it'll be just right for you.

690
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,769
Close, Frank, but no cigar.

691
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:17,601
- Well, if it's accuracy you want...
- Duh.

692
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,068
That's a Marlin 336.

693
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:24,477
Shoot a pig's eye out from 1,000 yards.

694
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,515
And who wouldn't wanna do that?

695
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,584
Frank, you're holding out on me. Come on.

696
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,483
Well, then again, if you're taking out
the Chinese god of war...

697
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,317
And we are.

698
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:37,621
...wrap your hands around this
Parker 12-gauge, double-barrel beauty.

699
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,024
That's for people that don't call 911.

700
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:47,162
I think we get the idea, Frank,
and thanks for that,

701
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,467
but I'd be willing to wager that Mr. Campbell
is more than capable of telling us

702
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,304
which weapons should be used
under the circumstances.

703
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,868
- Of course. I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell.
- That's okay.

704
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,915
Go ahead, Mr. Campbell,
tell us exactly what we need.

705
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:05,886
Well, I... Don't you think Frank really
said it all with the guns and everything? I...

706
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:09,049
Of course, for personal protection,
you may have never heard of this gun,

707
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:14,961
but I always
use a...permanent press.

708
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,996
But I can see that you
obviously don't have that gun here,

709
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:22,538
so I'll just have to limp along
with this.31 long-bow.

710
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,901
.45 long-slide.

711
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:28,034
Long-slide, like I said.
So, come on, Gold Lick, get your guns.

712
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,340
Give me a big one.
Take it easy.

713
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:31,914
One at a time.

714
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,643
- Bruce, can I show you something?
- Sure.

715
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,311
We got you covered. All right, look at us.

716
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,944
My goodness me.

717
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:44,655
- Now we can slide off to San Francisco.
- And I'm riding shotgun.

718
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:50,055
I thought you might wanna use this.

719
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,504
I had it made special.

720
00:52:56,907 --> 00:53:00,809
Briggs & Stratton two-stroke, half-inch claw.

721
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,779
- What do you think?
- Wow, it's really something.

722
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,974
You know, Jeff,

723
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,950
I've gotten a lot of use
out of chainsaws over the years,

724
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:16,048
killed a lot of zombies, saved a lot of lives.

725
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:20,661
But at the end of the day,
when push comes to shove,

726
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,322
they're just too damn heavy.

727
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:25,833
So thanks just the same, kid.
See you out there.

728
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,969
- Yeah.
- Don't be late.

729
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,947
All right.

730
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,573
- You guys ready for some violence?
Yeah!

731
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,584
That's right. All right.

732
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,679
- Sure you're ready for this, Bruce?
- Kid, I made a movie in Bulgaria.

733
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:50,590
I'm ready for anything.
Put yourself on ice, sugar lips,

734
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,457
because when I come back,
I'm gonna lay claim

735
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,894
to the prettiest pair of green eyes
I've ever seen.

736
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,659
Let's do this thing!

737
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,199
Be careful.

738
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,230
And my eyes are brown!

739
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,600
Dumb shit.

740
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,516
All right, folks, listen up.

741
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,744
It could get ugly out there tonight.

742
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,547
Real ugly.

743
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:21,112
So if something happens
and you don't think you're gonna make it,

744
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,589
just remember this,

745
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,751
even though
you don't have medical insurance,

746
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,988
emergency rooms
are mandated by federal law

747
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,587
to treat critically-injured patients.

748
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:32,065
So, technically,
you got nothing to worry about.

749
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,261
Aside from that,
Bruce Campbell's got your back.

750
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,804
All right!
- Yeah!

751
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:39,306
Now, come on, Gold Lick,
let's kick some Guan-Di butt!

752
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:49,513
Oh, yeah. This is Henderson.
I'm crossing Old Stage Road.

753
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,211
No sign of the demon, over.

754
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,721
Oh, my God, Henderson,
he's right behind you.

755
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:55,948
Oh, Jesus!

756
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,685
- Just kidding, chief!
- That ain't funny.

757
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,432
Jeff, after this is over,
I gotta meet your sound guy.

758
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:08,834
We don't have a sound guy.

759
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,929
All right, we're gonna try
and smoke him out.

760
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,737
He's got a sword, over!
- Stay your course, Chicken Little.

761
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,401
Oh, he's a big sucker!

762
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,537
Well, what do you expect?
He's the Chinese god of war.

763
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,946
Oh, no, he's spotted me.
He's coming to fight!

764
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,746
No! No!

765
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,255
Give it a rest, Shatner.

766
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,899
Bruce, do something!

767
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,938
- What the fuck is that?
- It's Guan-Di!

768
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,805
- You mean the son-of-a-bitch is real?
- Shouldn't we shoot it?

769
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:53,380
No! No! No!

770
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,178
Retreat!

771
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:02,451
Bruce, where are you going?
- Shoot it! Shoot it!

772
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,894
Daddy?

773
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,367
Daddy?

774
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:19,441
My ear.
Stop shooting! Stop shooting!

775
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:26,275
GUAN-Dl: Must die!

776
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,047
Keys! Keys!
Come on, it's the country.

777
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:32,280
Don't you keep your
fucking keys in your trucks?

778
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:38,485
All right.

779
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:42,897
Coil wire to the ignition.

780
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,591
What could possibly go wrong?

781
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,265
Oh, man!

782
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,000
That always worked in the movies.

783
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,516
Hey! Hey! Hey!

784
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,985
Thank you.

785
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:09,789
Give me back my bike, you old prick!
And McHale's Navy sucked.

786
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:26,205
Young man, are you all right?

787
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:30,206
Lady, you gotta give me
a ride out of here right now.

788
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:33,976
- I'm sorry, but there's no room.
- Oh, yeah, there is.

789
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:38,349
Oh, yeah. Get out of there.
Get out of there! Get out of here!

790
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,227
Oh, my kitty! My kitty cat!

791
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,830
Oh, you horrible man!

792
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:56,462
And you were the worst thing
about Moontrap!

793
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:02,239
"Yeah. Come to Gold Lick.
Help us fight a monster."

794
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,779
What the hell were they thinking?

795
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:08,116
Now the supernatural son-of-a-bitch
is after me.

796
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:11,278
Oh, man. I gotta blow this pop stand fast.

797
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:13,882
Oh!

798
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:18,551
I'm so screwed!
Oh, that cheapskate old lady.

799
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,592
Hey, guys.

800
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,361
I need a car, pronto!

801
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,737
Hey, ain't you that demon-fighting
son-of-a-bitch?

802
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,207
Yeah, I am.

803
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,778
I came back 'cause I needed
some garbage bags

804
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,575
and shovels 'cause we killed...

805
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,616
Hold that thought, guys. Nice talking to you.

806
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,486
Suckers! You won't have me
to kick around anymore.

807
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:51,219
You can take this little crappy-ass town
and shove it right up...

808
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,352
Hey, hey. What...

809
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,192
- Bruce.
- Yeah?

810
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:00,735
- Where's Jeff?
- Jeff...

811
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,532
What, you just left him out there?

812
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,664
Well, that depends on what the definition
of "out there" is.

813
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:08,073
And you know, lady, you never told me
that this monster was real!

814
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,508
Shoe lace.

815
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:14,080
There he is!
Stop that truck!

816
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:21,787
Mom!

817
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,216
Where's Bruce?

818
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,159
Stop that truck!

819
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:42,634
He's just a damn coward.

820
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:49,679
I've been here five years, nobody die.

821
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:51,811
Now, everybody die.

822
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:02,828
Nobody else better die.
You're gonna have to answer to Luigi.

823
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,860
Oh, shit.

824
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:09,200
There's some crazy shit
going down in this town.

825
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:17,605
What are you gonna do with that?

826
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,023
Huh?

827
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,847
Cute little Sam'nRob.

828
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:32,477
At least I still have you. Come here, boy.

829
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:33,555
Come on.

830
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,954
You son-of-a-bitch!

831
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,226
Maybe I'll feel better after breakfast.

832
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:45,232
It's the most important meal of the day.

833
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:48,064
This is
Bruce Campbell, actor extraordinaire.

834
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:51,698
If you're young, female
and not currently incarcerated,

835
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:55,835
page me at star-998,
otherwise, leave a message after the tone.

836
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,570
Bruce, it's Cheryl.

837
01:01:58,681 --> 01:01:59,705
Cheryl?

838
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,977
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you,

839
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,145
something that's been weighing on me
ever since our divorce.

840
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:06,687
Well, of course I forgive you!

841
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:09,656
It's the alimony payment.
It's just not cutting it.

842
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,449
Huh?

843
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,995
So my lawyer's filed a motion
to have it increased,

844
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:16,065
along with a fresh restraining order,

845
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:19,566
so don't even try returning this call,
you fuck head.

846
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:25,400
You heartless hell-spawn!
Get the fuck out of here!

847
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:29,070
Sleep with the scorpions, bitch!

848
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,745
Who does she think she is?

849
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:37,843
Think I'm some low-budget, two-bit actor?
Tell you what...

850
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,689
"From the desk of Mills Toddner.

851
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,992
"Pack your bags, baby.
Back-to-back in Bulgaria.

852
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:54,399
"Cave Alien 3 and 4. "

853
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,166
Oh, no!

854
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,472
No!

855
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:00,803
No!

856
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,104
Help me!

857
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,912
Hang on a second.

858
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:19,627
What the hell do you want? I'm busy.

859
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:22,664
Hi, I'm Kasey,
the famous singing prostitute.

860
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,632
I'm here to offer birthday greetings
and wish you lots of luck

861
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:27,896
And if you're really, really lucky
I'll even toss in a...

862
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,268
Oh, God, whoa, whoa. Who sent you?

863
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:36,235
"From your friend and agent, Mills Toddner.
Here's some birthday sugar, baby."

864
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:39,337
That's it? That was my special gift?
A woman?

865
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:42,849
Actually, I'm only half-way through
my transgender surgeries, so technically...

866
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:45,614
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
For the love of God, just stop!

867
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:57,455
- Campbell residence.
- Bruce, it's Jeff.

868
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:00,192
You little bastard.

869
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:01,861
You're the one
who dragged me into this nightmare.

870
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:05,168
Now, what, are you calling
to chew my ass out for taking a powder?

871
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:08,937
No, I... I just wanted to thank you.

872
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,706
Thank me? For what?

873
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:13,179
For teaching me the meaning of courage.

874
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:16,774
- I ran like cheap mascara.
- Well, that's just it.

875
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:20,322
While I was trying to dodge my
responsibilities by dumping them on you,

876
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:23,620
you showed me
I have to face this thing on my own.

877
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:25,621
Yeah.

878
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:29,529
I'm glad you learned the error
of your ways, kid, yeah.

879
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:32,897
I'm the one who unleashed Guan-Di.
It's up to me to kill it.

880
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:37,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're gonna take on
Toshiro McFuckhead solo?

881
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,274
Thank you, Mr. Campbell.

882
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,503
All I needed was a push.

883
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:45,972
No, no! Kid! Kid!

884
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,576
- Son-of-a...
- Boyfriend troubles?

885
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:50,811
No!

886
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,317
Stupid kid's gonna get himself killed!

887
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:57,358
What do I care? I got problems of my own.

888
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,391
- Who are you?
- I'm your good nature, Bruce.

889
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:04,193
Now, you heed my warning.

890
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,497
If Jeff goes up against Guan-Di
all by himself,

891
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,127
oh, he'll be cut to ribbons.

892
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,706
You've got to help the dear boy!

893
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:15,140
Oh, don't listen to him! Kid's an asshole!

894
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,735
Fuck him! Nobody lives forever!

895
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:21,283
How can you say such a thing?
You awful devil.

896
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,080
I got something for you right here, angel.

897
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,484
Bruce, you've got to help Jeff.

898
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,580
He's your biggest fan!

899
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:33,327
Get out of here, you freaks!
- I'm flying!

900
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,080
You, Nurse Ratched,
how would you like to make $100?

901
01:05:36,115 --> 01:05:38,197
You, Nurse Ratched,
how would you like to make $100?

902
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,396
Story of my life.

903
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:44,801
- No, no, no. I need a ride.
- That's why I'm here.

904
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,306
In your car.

905
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:51,137
- Kinky.
- No, I need a ride to a town called Gold Lick.

906
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:54,941
I need to kill me a Guan-Di.

907
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,763
Keep away from him, honey.
- All right. Now, stay here.

908
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,562
Try not to blow anybody till I get back.

909
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,482
Hey, Kelly!

910
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,347
Why don't you go home?

911
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:41,021
Go find yourself some fake Hollywood girl
'cause you and me were never real.

912
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,325
Kelly, please.

913
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:47,562
I'm not one of those shallow sex machines
like all those other Hollywood types.

914
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,230
Hey, mister, you still owe me $100!

915
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,868
And we still have to have sex!

916
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:58,808
Would you excuse me for just a second?

917
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:03,609
For the love of God,
just take the money and go.

918
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:07,587
Oh, I'll take a rain check
on the ex-say a little ater-lay.

919
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,180
Whatever, dude.

920
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:16,529
Kelly, look, we don't have much time...

921
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:18,224
Hey, that's all my stuff.

922
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:21,565
Yeah, well, Jeff asked me to purge his loft.

923
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,194
It was my pleasure.

924
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:26,138
Oh, sweet Jesus! That's a limited edition!

925
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,477
Plenty more where that came from.

926
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,939
Are you still here?
Don't you have a bad movie to make?

927
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,712
Listen, I know I let you down and I'm sorry.

928
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,951
But the callow movie star
who came into your life yesterday

929
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,991
is not the same man
who's standing here today.

930
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:48,956
It took the faith of a teenager and the
decency of a good woman to open my eyes.

931
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:53,900
Believe me, in the last 24 hours,
I've learned a lot about decency, respect,

932
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,836
even...Iove.

933
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:03,800
A man's isn't much of anything
unless he can learn from his mistakes

934
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,006
and make them right. So...

935
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:09,148
Look, I'm here to say I'm sorry.

936
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:12,787
But more importantly, I wanna make it right.

937
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:16,716
So I'm not asking
you for a second chance, Kelly.

938
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,487
I'm begging you.

939
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:23,429
Now, maybe it doesn't make much sense
because we don't know each other but...

940
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:24,863
I think I...

941
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,331
- I think I...
- Move the hand.

942
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:33,601
Sure.

943
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:38,407
Well, even if we're over,
at least help me rescue Jeff.

944
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,004
What, Jeff needs to be rescued?

945
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,947
Yeah, he's going after Guan-Di.
I thought you knew.

946
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,541
Oh, my God!

947
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,112
I...

948
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:53,687
Hey!

949
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,898
Hey! Wait! Wait!

950
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:22,654
Okay, maybe this was a bad idea.

951
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,757
Okay, this was definitely a bad idea.

952
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:36,529
Big ass, self-obsessed movie star.

953
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:40,871
- Haven't you ever heard of a telephone?
- Look, I am not self-obsessed.

954
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:44,037
Do you really think I have a big ass?

955
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:47,509
Do you even know where we're going?

956
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:50,949
Jeff's friends were killed outside
an old Chinese graveyard.

957
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:53,544
I'm guessing that's where they went.

958
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:59,587
- Move the hand.
- Okay, okay. My God.

959
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:10,497
Jeff!

960
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:12,232
Jeff!

961
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,836
He's not in there.

962
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:18,204
Well, if he has any sense,
he's probably hightailing it back to town.

963
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,578
If he had any sense,
he wouldn't have called you.

964
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:21,809
Jeff!

965
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:30,151
Stand back, Kel.
Mr. Winchester is itching for some action.

966
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:35,695
What? What? What am I... Oh.

967
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:42,601
Hey, you big son-of-a-bitch,
pick on somebody your own size!

968
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,229
Jeff, come on!

969
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:48,138
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah.

970
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,338
Yeah, I'm okay
in a scared-to-death kind of way.

971
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:57,810
Okay, here's the deal.

972
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,855
I'm gonna stall the one-ton wonton,
which should give you, oh, I don't know,

973
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:03,288
maybe 30 seconds to find a way to stop him

974
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:07,556
before he rips my head off and
shoves it in my face, so better get busy.

975
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,494
- Bruce.
- Yes, Kelly?

976
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:12,464
- Before you go...
- Yes?

977
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,197
You'll need ammo.

978
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,005
I knew that.

979
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:23,144
Okay, Jeff, you know this stuff
way better than I do.

980
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,213
- How do we stop it?
- Okay. Okay.

981
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,373
Hollywood writers
have spent countless hours

982
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:30,350
writing stories about defeating monsters.

983
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,943
There's gotta be something
we can use in here.

984
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,685
Hey, stay where I can see you!

985
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,155
Okay, doofus, here I am!

986
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:46,364
- How we doing, team?
- Okay. Bruce, I think this might work.

987
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,993
Where's the nearest
oceanic oil-drilling platform?

988
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:50,696
Oh, about 1,000 miles away.

989
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,008
Okay.

990
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,739
Do we have any abandoned steel mills
with giant vats of molten metal?

991
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:02,316
Oh, come on.

992
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:09,623
Okay, how about
extensive mine shaft systems

993
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:11,590
with cannibal bats
underneath active volcanoes?

994
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:13,389
You gotta be shitting me.

995
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:23,832
"Protected for those who

996
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:29,305
"died."

997
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,874
Be patient.

998
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:37,979
Oh!

999
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,519
You can't bowl for shit.
You should go back to Dayton.

1000
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:43,382
Oh!

1001
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:46,086
- Hello.
- Hello.

1002
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:48,620
You here for me?

1003
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,034
No, this and this. Thank you.

1004
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:01,901
You tricked me!

1005
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:05,012
An island full of giant, mutated gorillas?

1006
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,275
Oh, wait, no, you died in that one.

1007
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:11,046
Jeff, Hollywood writers spend all day
in dark rooms by themselves.

1008
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:13,121
They have no concept of reality whatsoever.

1009
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:17,090
So you'd better think of something else
and pretty damn fast.

1010
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:20,522
Bruce!

1011
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:26,495
The sign.
He's also the protector of bean curd.

1012
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,534
I'll be a horse's ass.
Pardon me, big guy.

1013
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:43,048
Well, it's nice to know that tofu
really is good for your health.

1014
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,179
- There he is.
Hey, lady!

1015
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:50,315
I'll get you. Give me back my bean curd.

1016
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:55,558
You afraid of Wing, huh?

1017
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:00,858
Wing powerful.

1018
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:05,372
More powerful than Guan-Di,
who is Wing's servant

1019
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:07,999
and must listen to anything Wing say.

1020
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,407
Right, Guan-Di?

1021
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,974
Guan-Di!

1022
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,548
Bean curd.

1023
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,192
- Hey, that's gives me an idea.
- What?

1024
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:30,458
Look, I know I'm throwing
a real Hail Mary here,

1025
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:32,431
but have you got any dynamite
in this truck?

1026
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:33,523
Of course I don't have any dynamite.

1027
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:36,365
- What kind of a freak would have dynamite...
- I do.

1028
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:44,277
Bruce, I've got dynamite,
wire and a plunger.

1029
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,378
What? I was going up
against Guan-Di, Mom.

1030
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,419
I brought all kinds of shit. I mean, stuff.

1031
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,887
Good. You get the dynamite,
meet me at the entrance of the mine shaft.

1032
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,515
- What, you're gonna use yourself as bait?
- Well, yes and no.

1033
01:14:57,626 --> 01:14:59,924
We're gonna get a little help
from my friend here.

1034
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,757
When Guan-Di spots
my ass on his doorstep,

1035
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:03,491
he's gonna go totally Pearl Harbor.

1036
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:05,590
That's when we drop the mountain
on his demon ass.

1037
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:10,001
- It sounds a little risky.
- You're telling me. This is our only standee.

1038
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:11,197
All right. Now, look,

1039
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:15,106
when hari-kari Larry takes a dirt nap,
we take this sacred amulet,

1040
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:19,169
you know, the entire reason why we're here,
we put it right back where it belongs.

1041
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:22,045
That way we can all get back
to our normal, miserable lives.

1042
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,282
Well, this is it.

1043
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:34,021
I'll keep him away from the entrance
until you give the signal.

1044
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:39,826
Now, look, no matter which way this goes,
I want you both to know one thing.

1045
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:43,862
I'll never forgive you
for dragging me out here.

1046
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,372
Okay, just you and me, Top Ramen.

1047
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:58,080
You're the protector of bean curd.
Get busy.

1048
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:03,350
Nice catch.

1049
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:10,789
Hey, grounder.

1050
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,233
That's gonna mean some extra runs!

1051
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:18,968
Oh, another one!

1052
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:21,773
Oh, bad hop.

1053
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:23,469
Almost ready.

1054
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,526
- Good to go, Mom.
- We're ready!

1055
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:53,001
Just walking along,
minding my own business.

1056
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,973
Oh, look, a mine shaft.

1057
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:01,048
Hey, asshole!

1058
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,444
Go fuck yourself!

1059
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:17,397
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Let him get all the way in.

1060
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:29,940
- He's not buying it.
- That's weird, I approved that likeness.

1061
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,637
Bruce, what do we do?

1062
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:34,045
Well, looks like we're gonna have to do this
the old-fashioned way,

1063
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:37,277
- mano a monster.
- But that's suicide.

1064
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:40,150
Only if I die, kid. Wish me luck.

1065
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,519
- Bruce.
- Yes?

1066
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:45,523
For luck.

1067
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:52,863
- You wanna move that hand?
- That's not my hand.

1068
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:08,182
- Okay, Jeff, do it. Now!
- Mom, I can't!

1069
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:11,878
Not the face! Not the face!

1070
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:14,085
It is Bruce Campbell!

1071
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,680
Look, I know how much he means to you,

1072
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:19,784
how much he means
to all the audiences across the world,

1073
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,556
how much he means to me.

1074
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:25,030
But look, you've got to just think
of one question right now.

1075
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:27,624
What would Bruce Campbell do?

1076
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:29,465
- Run away?
- No!

1077
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,597
I can't believe he's gone.

1078
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,087
Stay there.

1079
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,132
Bruce.

1080
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,270
Bruce.

1081
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:39,067
Well, I'm glad that's over.

1082
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:43,373
- Jeff, I just have one request.
- Anything, Bruce.

1083
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:47,005
Next time you unleash an ancient demon,
call that Buffy chick.

1084
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:05,459
Stop! Stop!

1085
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:09,067
What's the problem, Bruce?

1086
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:12,705
Look, I'm sorry,
but these shock endings are a rip off.

1087
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:16,676
I mean, we just killed the creature
like 30 seconds ago, and now it's back?

1088
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:18,439
The fans deserve better.

1089
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:23,143
And come on, for once, could we please
have a happy ending to a horror film?

1090
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:27,484
- Yeah. A happy ending is a great...
- I'll think about it.

1091
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,454
Think about it, though.

1092
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:40,558
Oh, I never knew life could be so swell.

1093
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:44,366
Well, once you've made love
the Bruce Campbell way, you never go back.

1094
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:48,203
Father, Mother,
I've just been accepted to Harvard.

1095
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:51,606
I told you that C average
was nothing to worry about.

1096
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:54,339
Group hug.

1097
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:57,145
You happy?

1098
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:58,446
- You happy?
- Oh, yes.

1099
01:20:58,553 --> 01:21:01,750
- We're all happy.
- One big happy family.

1100
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:14,827
Now, I ask you,
what could be a better ending than that?

1101
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:17,604
Oh, my God!
