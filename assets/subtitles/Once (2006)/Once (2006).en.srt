# Well, the healing has begun #

00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:30,961
Come on, give me that.

26
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:32,796
Give me the case.

27
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:34,397
What are you fucking at, man?

28
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:37,452
For fuck's sake.

29
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:39,302

30
00:02:39,403 --> 00:02:40,671

33
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:48,812
- Oh, fuck.
- There's all your money.

34
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:50,848
I'm just dying

35
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:53,613
Look, there's 20 cent.
Look it.

36
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:57,088
Look, don't fucking rob me.

37
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:59,524
I'm down there trying to fucking
make a living like anyone else.

38
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:02,028

the same team, man.

00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:03,393
I'm sorry, right,
I'm sorry, man.

40
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:05,463
But you're right.
You're rapid, you are.

41
00:03:05,563 --> 00:03:07,231
You want money, just fucking,
just ask me for it.

42
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:09,668
Don't have me chase you all
the way up the street for it.

43
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:14,090
Want to give us that
fiver then, do ya?

44
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,360
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Here.

45
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,911
How's your ma?

46
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:21,997
She's dead, man.

47
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:23,247
Well, how's your old fella?

48
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,863
Fair play to ya, right?

49
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:28,054
I'll see you later,

50
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:29,856
Look, there's two euros, look.

51
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:31,257
Fair play to ya, right?

52
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:33,363
See you, good luck, man.

53
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:02,147
# Scratching
at the surface now #

54
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:08,961
# And I'm trying hard
to work it out #

55
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:16,197
# And so much has gone
misunderstood #

56
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,241
# And this mystery
only leads to doubt #

57
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:29,515
# And I didn't understand #

58
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:36,486
# When you reached out
to take my hand #

59
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:43,466
# And if you have
something to say#

60
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:49,789
# You'd better say it now #

61
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,744
# 'Cause this is
what you've waited for#

62
00:04:56,512 --> 00:05:00,317
# Your chance to even up
the score #

63
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:06,768
# And as these shadows fall #

64
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:12,580
# On me now I'll win somehow #

65
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,083
# Yeah #

66
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:22,154
# 'Cause I'm picking up
a message, Lord #

67
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:28,728
# That I'm closer
than I've ever been before #

68
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,967
# So if you have something
to say #

69
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,784
# Say it to me now#

70
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,359
# Just say it to me now, now #

71
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:50,687
# Oh, oh #

72
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:53,786
# 0h #

73
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,873
# 0h. #

74
00:06:10,823 --> 00:06:12,224
Thanks.

75
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:15,042
Ten cents
brilliant. Thanks.

76
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,862
Excuse me?

77
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:19,058
Sorry.

78
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,035
<i>Big Issue?</i>

79
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:24,454
Can't afford it.

80
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:28,021
This song you just play,
you write it?

81
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,675
Working on it.

82
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,577
It's not an established song?

83
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:33,947
No, it's not an
established song.

84
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:35,282
How come you don't play it

85
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:36,416
during daytime?

86
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:37,918
I see you every day.

87
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:40,921
You know, during the day, people
want to hear songs they know,

88
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:42,456
just songs that they recognize.

89
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:44,059
I mean, otherwise,
I wouldn't make any money.

90
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,892
I play these songs at night.
They wouldn't listen.

91
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:47,944
I listen.

92
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:50,747
Yeah, but you gave me ten cents.

93
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:53,014
You do it
for money then?

94
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:54,401
Why don't you
get a job

95
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,636
in a shop?

96
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:58,753
I have a job in a shop.

97
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,942
Listen, I'm going to get
back to this, yeah?

98
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:02,145
Nice to meet you.

99
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:04,477
Who'd you write that song
for, please?

100
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:07,014
No one.

101
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:13,402
Bullshit.

102
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:14,924
Where is she?

103
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:18,412
She's gone.

104
00:07:18,512 --> 00:07:20,328
She's dead?

105
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:23,782
No, she's not dead, she's gone.

106
00:07:23,882 --> 00:07:25,567
You love her still?

107
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,796
Jesus, man.

108
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:34,126
You're over her.

109
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:35,345
Rubbish.

110
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:37,479
No one who would write
this song is over her.

111
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:39,181
I'm telling you.

112
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:42,084
You play this marvelous song
to her, you get her back.

113
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:44,153
I don't want her back.

114
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:47,041
I see.

115
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:50,011
What shop you work in?

116
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,929
I work in a Hoover repair shop.

117
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,264
A Hoover?

118
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:55,932
You know, like a vacuum cleaner.
Whhzzz.

119
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:58,182
You fix vacuum cleaners?

120
00:07:58,282 --> 00:07:59,303
I do.

121
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:02,324
I have a broken vacuum cleaner.

122
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:04,108
- You fix it for me?
- Yeah.

123
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,877
I bring it tomorrow then?

124
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:06,811
Okay.

125
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,845
This is great.

126
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,846
Tomorrow?

127
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,881
Right.

128
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:11,814
- Okay, bye.
- Good luck.

129
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:22,610
# You have broken me
all the way down #

130
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,102
# Down upon my knees #

131
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:36,892
# And you have broken me
all the way now #

132
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:46,032
Hi. This is Catherine.

133
00:08:46,132 --> 00:08:49,521
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

134
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:12,131
# I'll be far to sea #

135
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:20,653
That job's ready
for collection now, Dad.

136
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:22,389
Okay, son.

137
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:24,872
I'm going to head into town.

138
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,869
Should I turn this
around for you?

139
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:32,301
What'll I get for dinner?

140
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:34,403
The fish, maybe.

141
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:00,996
Hello.

142
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:03,131
How are you? How's it going?

143
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:04,633
I bring you my Hoover.

144
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:10,940
All right.

145
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,958
What's wrong with it?

146
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:14,993
It is fucked.

147
00:10:15,093 --> 00:10:16,845
It doesn't suck up
the dirt.

148
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:18,414
Well, listen, there's
nothing I can do,

149
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:20,316
I don't have any of my
tools or nothing with me.

150
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,851
I'm going on me break now.

151
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:23,586
Can you bring it in
tomorrow or something?

152
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:25,688
Well, no, I bring it today.

153
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:27,942
- You, you...
- Yeah, but there's nothing

154
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,258
I can do with it, love,

155
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:30,460
I don't have
me tools, or...

156
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,295
It's like I have
to bring it home.

157
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:36,650
If I come on break, you have
a look at it at least?

158
00:10:37,134 --> 00:10:38,601
Yeah, but you
don't understand.

159
00:10:38,702 --> 00:10:40,204
I come with you, then?

160
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:42,758
For lunch?

161
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:43,807
Yeah, all right.

162
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:45,276
- Yes, we go together?
- Yeah.

163
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:47,043
Okay.

164
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:49,159
Thank you.

165
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,054
- You hungry?
- I'm always hungry.

166
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:04,657
So you know a bit
about music then?

167
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,767
My father used to play in
the orchestra back at home.

168
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:12,465
He played violin.

169
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,243
But he got arthritis then,
and he killed himself.

170
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,677
Really?

171
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:22,480
But before he go, he teach me
how to play piano.

172
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,883
'It's not so hard
on the fingers' he said.

173
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:28,034
Do you get to play much?

174
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:31,223
Hmm. No, I don't, I don't
have a piano at home.

175
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,326
I can't get one in Ireland;
it's so much money.

176
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,428
I can't afford it.

177
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:39,215
Yeah, it's expensive
all right.

178
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,109
I play in a
piano shop.

179
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,578
This man lets me play-

180
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,929
one hour per day
at lunch.

181
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,596
Somewhere around here?

182
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:56,949
You want to
hear me play?

183
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,001
- Yeah.
- Now?

184
00:11:59,102 --> 00:11:59,986
Yeah.

185
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,318
Okay.

186
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:07,495
Can we come in?

187
00:12:16,304 --> 00:12:18,206
This is the man
I was telling you about.

188
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:19,407
He's a real gentleman.

189
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:20,408
Hi.

190
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:21,676
Okay for me
to play today?

191
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:22,877
Yeah, that's fine.

192
00:12:22,977 --> 00:12:24,079
Thanks.

193
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:26,548
Not the baby Yamaha
though. She's sold.

194
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:28,651
- Okie-dokie.
- Mm-hmm.

195
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:36,325
Now, which one today?

196
00:13:51,437 --> 00:13:52,572
That kind of thing.

197
00:13:55,023 --> 00:13:57,256
It's amazing.

198
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:58,310
Did you write that?

199
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,263
No, no, Mendelssohn did.

200
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:02,380
It's good.

201
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,542
It's good, yes.

202
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,719
Play me another
of your songs.

203
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:07,721
No.

204
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:08,722
Please.

205
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:09,756
Not here.

206
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,525
Why? Here, Billy
doesn't mind.

207
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:15,027
- You think it would be all right?
- Yes.

208
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:17,596
Okay.

209
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:19,198
Let's put that there, yeah?

210
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:21,300
Mm-hmm.

211
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:24,438
This is in C, yeah?

212
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:26,540
Yeah, okay,
I can see that.

213
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,593
Okay.

214
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:30,891
So, it goes, um...

215
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:35,230
Da... It goes,
# Da-da-da-da #

216
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:42,676
# Da-da-da-da,
da-da-da-da-da #

217
00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:44,425
Yeah? And then there's
a bit in there-

218
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:46,527
Can you do that?

219
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:54,251
# Da-da-da-da-da... #

220
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,436
Brilliant.

221
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:57,238
And then there's another
part that goes, uh...

222
00:14:57,338 --> 00:15:00,788
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

223
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:04,859
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

224
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,733
# Ba-ba-pa-pa-pa #

225
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,918
Yeah? And then the
chorus, let's see.

226
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:12,186
- You have those two bits?
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,389
And the chorus goes...

228
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:17,608
# Da-da-da-da-da

229
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:24,586
# Pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa #

230
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:31,493
# Ba-ba... da-da. #

231
00:15:31,593 --> 00:15:33,008
That's it. Perfect. Brilliant.

232
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:34,877
So, do you want
to give it a spin?

233
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:38,428
- Yes, try it.
- Okay.

234
00:15:38,528 --> 00:15:40,282
Two, three,

235
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:42,384
four.

236
00:15:55,998 --> 00:16:03,191
# I don't know you,
but I want you #

237
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:10,730
# All the more for that #

238
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:18,175
# And words fall through me
and always fool me #

239
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:23,709
# And I can't react #

240
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:25,877
We change here.

241
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:34,224
# And games that never amount
to more than they're meant #

242
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:39,427
# Will play themselves out #

243
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:40,747
Hold it.

244
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,849
And the chorus.

245
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:52,442
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

246
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:58,580
# We've still got time #

247
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,387
# Raise your hopeful voice #

248
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,654
# You had the choice #

249
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:14,210
# You've made it now #

250
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:24,706
# Falling slowly,
eyes that know me #

251
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:28,960
# And I can't go back #

252
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:39,756
# Moods that take me
and erase me #

253
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:47,100
# And I'm painted black#

254
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:55,776
# Well, you have suffered enough
and warred with yourself #

255
00:17:55,876 --> 00:18:00,322
# It's time that you won #

256
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:04,600
Again.

257
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:14,028
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

258
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:20,401
# We've still got time #

259
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:25,171
# Raise your hopeful voice #

260
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,406
# You had the choice #

261
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:35,802
# You've made it now #

262
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:46,847
# Uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-huh... #

263
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:52,215
# Yeah #

264
00:18:52,315 --> 00:19:00,442
# Take this sinking boat
and point it home #

265
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:06,849
# We've still got time #

266
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:11,383
# Raise your hopeful voice #

267
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:21,199
# You had the choice,
you've made it now #

268
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:29,202
# Falling slowly,
sing your melody #

269
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:36,201
# I'll sing along... #

270
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:54,797
# Ah, ah... #

271
00:19:54,897 --> 00:19:59,101
# #

272
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:01,653
# Call and I'll sing along. #

273
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,122
I moved back in
about a year ago,

274
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:38,562
after me ma died, just to
help me dad out, you know.

275
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:41,964
So tell me about her.

276
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:43,933
Who, me ma?

277
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:48,956
No, the girl, the special girl
you write these songs for.

278
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:50,271
No.

279
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:52,622
Come on.

280
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:54,710
What did she do to you?

281
00:20:57,713 --> 00:21:01,298
Well.

282
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:09,576
# Ten years ago, I fell in
love with an Irish girl #

283
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:12,579
# She took my heart #

284
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:18,250
# But she went and screwed
some guy that she knew #

285
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,258
# And now I'm in Dublin
with a broken heart #

286
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:28,595
# Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker guy#

287
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:32,933
# Oh, broken-hearted
Hoover-fixer sucker... #

288
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:36,602
# Sucker guy #

289
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:40,873
# One day, I'll go there
and win her once again #

290
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:47,379
# But until then, I'm just
a sucker of a guy. #

291
00:21:53,906 --> 00:21:57,225
So she's with him now?

292
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:58,275
- No.
- Don't know.

293
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,378
Where is she?

294
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:05,318
# She's in old London town #

295
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:12,289
# Living somewhere
around Chiswick. #

296
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:19,166
I miss her.
It's just sort of... you know.

297
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,553
You're not going
to go get her?

298
00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:25,405
No?

299
00:22:25,505 --> 00:22:28,740
No. Fuck her.

300
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,678
# Fuck her,
fuck her. #

301
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:32,178
# Fuck her, she's gone #

302
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:35,199
# Fuck her, she's gone forever#

303
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:36,916
# She fucking fucked it up!... #

304
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:38,518
Sorry.

305
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:39,619
Sorry.

306
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:42,804
# Fucking fucked it up #

307
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,873
# She fucking fucked it up! #

308
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:48,096
# And now she's gonna die. #

309
00:22:58,387 --> 00:23:01,266
Give us the sharp eight
there, son.

310
00:23:06,313 --> 00:23:08,429
And the Phillips.

311
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,517
Come on.

312
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:15,156
Your son
is a very talented man, sir.

313
00:23:15,256 --> 00:23:17,960
Well, he should be.
I trained him meself.

314
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,762
Oh, no. I meant the songs.

315
00:23:19,862 --> 00:23:21,911
Oh, right. Is he?

316
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:23,731
- Very.
- Okay, that's done.

317
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:25,734
You can take it back
with you.

318
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,936
It was just the belt,
so it should be all right now.

319
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:29,905
Thank you.
How much do I owe you?

320
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:31,439
Oh, you're fine there;
it's free.

321
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:33,922
Nothing's for free.
How much?

322
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:37,748
Say four euro, love.

323
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:43,052
Okay. We're going
to head upstairs, Dad.

324
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:45,288
Is there anything
else you need?

325
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:46,656
No, I'm grand.

326
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:48,024
Okay.

327
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,993
A pleasure to meet you, sir.

328
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:51,728
And you.

329
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:52,996
Take care.

330
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:55,099
Good.

331
00:24:03,306 --> 00:24:05,308
Come on in.

332
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,618
There you are.

333
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,339
Wow.

334
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,942
Can you transfer this stuff on to
disc for me so I can listen?

335
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:40,029
Yeah.

336
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:41,347
I have to go now.

337
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,531
Do you want to stay?

338
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:46,698
What do you mean?

339
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:48,934
Stay the night?

340
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:51,321
What?

341
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,329
Fuck this.

342
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:58,064
Thanks for the Hoover, yeah?

343
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,461
- See you.
- See you around.

344
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,973
Fuck.

345
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,675
Flowers? Flowers?

346
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:19,619
- Hey.
- Hey.

347
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,735
How's it going?

348
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:23,489
Hey, where you going?

349
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:27,674
I wanted to give you the CDs
that I made for you.

350
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,197
I'm really...
I'm just really lonely,

351
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:31,899
and you're gorgeous,
and I just...

352
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,935
I'm sorry. I fucked up.
I'm sorry. I...

353
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:36,719
I don't know what to say.

354
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:38,807
It won't happen again.

355
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:46,747
Do you have a CD player?

356
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,450
Yeah.

357
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,100
Here you go.

358
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,257
Batteries are pretty low,
but it should work.

359
00:25:54,357 --> 00:25:56,326
I give it back.

360
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:57,959
No problem. Keep it.

361
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,608
I have to go now.

362
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,297
I'll talk
to you later.

363
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:04,599
You don't want to get a cup of
tea or something? I'd love to...

364
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:06,302
just talk to you
a bit more.

365
00:26:06,402 --> 00:26:08,804
I have responsibilities.
I have to go home.

366
00:26:08,905 --> 00:26:11,340
Is it okay to walk along
with you then?

367
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,775
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

368
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,277
Cool. Cool.
So how was it today?

369
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:17,459
Selling good.

370
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,315
And today is a really good day
for me

371
00:26:19,415 --> 00:26:23,203
because I got a job
in a big house, cleaning.

372
00:26:23,303 --> 00:26:26,856
This lady is going to pay me
some money, so I'm very happy.

373
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:29,594
That's brilliant.
I'm delighted.

374
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:40,704
This is where I live.

375
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:44,057
Oh, yeah? Cool.

376
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:45,976
All right, then.

377
00:26:46,077 --> 00:26:47,678
Do you want to come in?

378
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:51,964
Can I? Yeah. Cool.

379
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:53,583
Hi, guys.

380
00:26:53,683 --> 00:26:54,718
Hello.

381
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:55,719
How are you today?

382
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:56,887
Not bad, not bad.

383
00:26:56,987 --> 00:26:58,256
How is work?

384
00:26:58,356 --> 00:26:59,891
It's great.

385
00:26:59,991 --> 00:27:02,086
See you later.

386
00:27:40,865 --> 00:27:42,334
Ah, hi.

387
00:27:44,684 --> 00:27:46,540
This is my friend.
This is my mother.

388
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,721
How are you?

389
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:50,776
Nice to meet you.
How's it going?

390
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:58,267
This is my
daughter Ivonka.

391
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:01,035
Come on.

392
00:28:01,135 --> 00:28:03,353
Hello, Ivonka. Hello.

393
00:28:15,685 --> 00:28:17,622
Sorry?

394
00:28:17,722 --> 00:28:20,174
That's dinner. Do you
want to stay for dinner?

395
00:28:20,274 --> 00:28:22,276
Yeah. Thank you.

396
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,489
Want to sit down?

397
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,757
Yeah.

398
00:29:01,317 --> 00:29:03,119
Well, what did she say?

399
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:04,787
She says you're handsome.

400
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:06,123
She what?

401
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:07,789
Says you're handsome.

402
00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:09,291
How do I say thanks?

403
00:29:14,163 --> 00:29:15,532
Says, 'You're welcome.'

404
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:17,301
Cool. Thanks.

405
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:18,669
Ty to speak a little English, Mama.

406
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:20,772
No, thank you.

407
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:23,774
Careful.

408
00:29:23,874 --> 00:29:25,241
Careful, Ivonka.
Don't do that.

409
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:27,383
She's grand.
She's grand.

410
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,747
Where's her dad?

411
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:33,329
He doesn't live here.

412
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:36,014
Why not?

413
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:39,792
He's at home.

414
00:29:46,665 --> 00:29:48,617
Hello. Hi.

415
00:29:48,717 --> 00:29:50,068
These are
from next door.

416
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:52,435
They come in
to watch telly.

417
00:29:52,535 --> 00:29:54,272
- Yeah.
- Hi, guys.

418
00:29:54,373 --> 00:29:55,840
There's only one
telly in the building.

419
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,543
<i>We watch Fair City together.</i>

420
00:29:57,643 --> 00:29:59,243
<i>Fair City, we love. <i/></i>

421
00:29:59,343 --> 00:30:02,096
<i>We learn English
from Fair City.</i>

422
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:03,915
Are you not pregnant?

423
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:08,104
How are you, man?

424
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:10,214
What is the hurry?

425
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:23,936
Just put her in there.

426
00:30:24,036 --> 00:30:26,038
Okay.

427
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:29,109
There you go, dearie.

428
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:33,878
Okay.

429
00:30:33,978 --> 00:30:35,981
She likes you.

430
00:31:09,282 --> 00:31:12,333
You have no lyrics
for this one?

431
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:14,823
It's really good.
I like it.

432
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:19,974
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

433
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:22,765
Huh?

434
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:27,386
I've got a few,
but they're not right.

435
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,950
What? Do you like it?

436
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,273
It's great.

437
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:35,210
Would you be into trying...
trying to write lyrics for it?

438
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,979
Really? I could?

439
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,448
Yeah. It's just
like that idea?

440
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:40,283
- Yeah.
- Cool. Cool.

441
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:41,483
That would be good.

442
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,252
I can keep machine
and write it?

443
00:31:43,352 --> 00:31:45,587
Yeah. Do. I was having
a bit of trouble with it.

444
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:47,657
It's too romantic for me.

445
00:31:47,757 --> 00:31:49,292
It is romantic.

446
00:31:49,392 --> 00:31:51,194
You have a
romantic streak.

447
00:31:51,294 --> 00:31:54,344
I used to have
a romantic streak.

448
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,433
When?

449
00:31:57,501 --> 00:32:00,217
When I was your age,
I suppose.

450
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,205
I see. You're
an old man now.

451
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:04,307
Yeah. Dying.

452
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:08,044
Cynical.

453
00:32:11,883 --> 00:32:13,852
You have to go now.

454
00:32:13,952 --> 00:32:16,553
Thanks for the Hoover
and food and songs.

455
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:18,656
No problem.

456
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,630
Thanks for the company.

457
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,263
I needed it.

458
00:32:26,364 --> 00:32:28,366
Me, too.

459
00:32:29,902 --> 00:32:32,304
You don't want
to go for late coffee

460
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:33,970
or a walk or something? No?

461
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,739
I can't. See you.

462
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,341
Bye.

463
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:39,444
See you.

464
00:33:15,481 --> 00:33:17,484
Fuck you, batteries.

465
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:36,364
Jesus.

466
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,580
I'll pay you back.

467
00:33:49,182 --> 00:33:51,185
Come on.

468
00:34:03,464 --> 00:34:06,583
# Are you really here #

469
00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:10,591
# Or am I dreaming? #

470
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:16,192
# I can't tell dream
from truth #

471
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:19,293
# For it's been so long #

472
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:23,135
# Since I have seen you #

473
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:29,112
# I can hardly remember
your face anymore #

474
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:35,814
# When I get pretty lonely #

475
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:41,656
# And the distance
causes only silence #

476
00:34:41,756 --> 00:34:48,261
# I think of you smiling #

477
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:51,962
# With pride in your eyes #

478
00:34:52,062 --> 00:34:55,498
# Lover that sighs #

479
00:34:55,598 --> 00:35:01,377
# If you want me #

480
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:07,851
# Satisfy me #

481
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:14,122
# If you want me #

482
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:20,674
# Satisfy me #

483
00:35:22,515 --> 00:35:29,908
# Are you really sure
that you believe me #

484
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:35,577
# When others say I lie? #

485
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:42,554
# I wonder if you could
ever despise me #

486
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:48,290
# When you know I really tried #

487
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,728
# To be a better one #

488
00:35:51,828 --> 00:35:55,233
# To satisfy you #

489
00:35:55,334 --> 00:36:01,037
# For you're everything to me #

490
00:36:01,137 --> 00:36:07,812
# And I'll do what you ask me #

491
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:14,789
# If you let me be free #

492
00:36:14,889 --> 00:36:20,794
# If you want me #

493
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:27,267
# Satisfy me #

494
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:33,640
# If you want me #

495
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:40,463
# Satisfy me #

496
00:36:52,807 --> 00:36:59,032
# If you want me #

497
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:05,271
# Satisfy me #

498
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:11,746
# If you want me #

499
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:17,932
# Satisfy me #

500
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:04,033
# Escalated #

501
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:10,585
# Little cracks they escalated #

502
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:18,144
# From back inside comes #

503
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:22,383
# Lies, lies #

504
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:26,655
# Breaking... #

505
00:38:26,755 --> 00:38:28,855
# When will... #

506
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:30,077
When will you learn?

507
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:32,179
When will you learn?

508
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:43,109
# I think it's time
we give it up #

509
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:49,712
# And figure out
what's stopping us #

510
00:38:49,813 --> 00:38:56,520
# From breathing easy #

511
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:03,830
# And talking straight #

512
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:10,535
# The way is clear
if you're ready now #

513
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:18,277
# The volunteer
is slowing down #

514
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:23,150
# And taking time #

515
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:32,129
# To save himself #

516
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:39,333
# The little cracks,
they escalated #

517
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:45,503
# Before we knew
it was too late #

518
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:52,949
# For making circles #

519
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:59,306
# And telling lies #

520
00:40:06,043 --> 00:40:11,868
# And I, I can't
keep up with you #

521
00:40:11,968 --> 00:40:18,706
# Maybe if you
slowed down for me #

522
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:24,012
# I could see
you're only telling #

523
00:40:24,112 --> 00:40:29,919
# Lies, lies, lies #

524
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:35,689
# Breaking us down with your #

525
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:41,396
# Lies, lies, lies #

526
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:47,255
# When will you learn? #

527
00:41:11,744 --> 00:41:17,637
# The little cracks,
they escalated #

528
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:24,077
# Before we knew
it was too late #

529
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:31,079
# For making circles #

530
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:38,739
# And telling lies #

531
00:41:43,677 --> 00:41:49,333
# And I, I can't keep up with you #

532
00:41:49,434 --> 00:41:55,507
# Maybe if you'd
slow down for me #

533
00:41:55,607 --> 00:42:01,245
# I could see
you're only telling #

534
00:42:01,345 --> 00:42:06,517
# Lies, lies, lies #

535
00:42:06,617 --> 00:42:12,325
# Breaking us down with your #

536
00:42:12,425 --> 00:42:18,462
# Lies, lies, lies #

537
00:42:18,562 --> 00:42:25,119
# When will you learn? #

538
00:42:27,624 --> 00:42:30,755
# So plant the thought #

539
00:42:40,437 --> 00:42:41,904
Would you like to buy a flower?

540
00:42:42,004 --> 00:42:43,573
- Hi. How are you?
- How's it going?

541
00:42:43,673 --> 00:42:44,875
Pretty good.

542
00:42:44,975 --> 00:42:46,810
- Pretty good.
- Good to see you.

543
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,280
I'm going to go to
London, I've decided.

544
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,382
- Good.
- Yeah.

545
00:42:50,482 --> 00:42:51,416
That's great.

546
00:42:51,516 --> 00:42:52,949
Yeah, it's good,
it makes sense.

547
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:54,751
Well done.

548
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:56,420
When are you going?

549
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,603
I'm going
to go Monday.

550
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:00,940
Wow, that's, that's soon.

551
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,528
You'll get
your girlfriend back,

552
00:43:03,628 --> 00:43:05,564
and you'll get
your record deal, and...

553
00:43:05,664 --> 00:43:08,618
- become famous.
- Yeah, right.

554
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:09,933
- Good.
- But listen,

555
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:11,602
I was thinking, I was
thinking before I go,

556
00:43:11,702 --> 00:43:13,637
I want to make a recording
of a few songs.

557
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:15,206
A couple of the songs
I was playing you,

558
00:43:15,306 --> 00:43:17,709
and I really liked the way
you played and your singing.

559
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:20,312
So, if you feel like, would
you be into playing along?

560
00:43:20,412 --> 00:43:21,679
Like what we
were playing on?

561
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:23,616
- I would sing and play?
- Yeah.

562
00:43:23,716 --> 00:43:25,084
I'd love that.

563
00:43:25,184 --> 00:43:26,484
Really? Cool.

564
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,920
- So you'd be in my band for a few days.
- Yeah.

565
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,140
Well, that's the first thing
I've got sorted out.

566
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,894
Now I just need to sort
everything else out.

567
00:43:34,994 --> 00:43:37,830
All right, guys, welcome.

568
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:41,667
Now, so let me
give you the tour.

569
00:43:41,768 --> 00:43:44,202
That is your
live rooms in there.

570
00:43:44,303 --> 00:43:45,837
This is a new desk.

571
00:43:45,937 --> 00:43:48,874
You got your hard drive and
you got your outboard gear.

572
00:43:48,974 --> 00:43:50,410
Now all in all
we're talking about

573
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,511
three grand
for a weekend of...

574
00:43:51,611 --> 00:43:52,612
- Three?
- Yeah.

575
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:54,147
Three grand, that's pretty good.

576
00:43:54,247 --> 00:43:55,550
You must be crazy.

577
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:56,750
$3,000

578
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:59,136
Well, have a look around.

579
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,801
You've everything
you need.

580
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:04,790
- What do you think, is it good?
- It's pretty good.

581
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,311
We'll give you one.

582
00:44:09,095 --> 00:44:10,063
I'm sorry.

583
00:44:10,163 --> 00:44:11,466
Have you heard
this guy's songs?

584
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,867
I haven't yet, no.

585
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:13,935
He's great.

586
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:15,002
Okay, but, uh,

587
00:44:15,102 --> 00:44:18,504
listen, I can fill
this place in an hour.

588
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,604
One and a half then,
that's my limit.

589
00:44:25,379 --> 00:44:27,181
We can talk about two.

590
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:28,816
We don't talk.

591
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,152
We shake.

592
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:31,386
We shake on two, yeah?

593
00:44:31,486 --> 00:44:33,288
Shake now?

594
00:44:33,388 --> 00:44:34,491
All right.

595
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:35,490
Two thousand.

596
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,657
She drives a hard bargain.

597
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,760
She's a tough cookie.

598
00:44:42,731 --> 00:44:45,314
So you like this shop?

599
00:44:45,414 --> 00:44:47,652
I buy all my clothes here.

600
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:49,639
It's good for me, you know?

601
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:51,307
Cheap.

602
00:44:51,407 --> 00:44:53,433
Nice fashions.

603
00:44:54,576 --> 00:44:55,510
Okay, you ready?

604
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,705
Yeah, I'm ready.

605
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:04,487
That's good. That will do.

606
00:45:04,587 --> 00:45:06,423
<i>Do you like it?</i>

607
00:45:06,523 --> 00:45:07,625
You're gorgeous.

608
00:45:07,725 --> 00:45:09,725
All right, can we go?

609
00:45:35,686 --> 00:45:36,987
The quality is poor,

610
00:45:37,087 --> 00:45:40,125
but if we can get
a professional tape,

611
00:45:40,225 --> 00:45:44,818
I'm, I'm satisfied that he
can secure a lucrative deal.

612
00:45:46,463 --> 00:45:48,599
You take it home, you,
you listen to it.

613
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,933
You play it to your boss.

614
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:53,012
I'm sure you can
get him to approve.

615
00:45:53,972 --> 00:45:55,240
Can I show you something?

616
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:59,291
# I want to be free #

617
00:45:59,391 --> 00:46:00,880
# I want to be me #

618
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,333
# I want you to bayou #

619
00:46:31,778 --> 00:46:33,827
Nice one, lads.

620
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:34,881
How's it going?

621
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:35,981
How's it going?
All right.

622
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:37,049
Good, how is it today?

623
00:46:37,149 --> 00:46:38,050
Is it slow?

624
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,720
Have a look
there yourself.

625
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,822
Is that it? Is that it?

626
00:46:43,055 --> 00:46:44,358
That's how it's
going at the moment.

627
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:45,592
Listen, I wanted
to ask you,

628
00:46:45,693 --> 00:46:47,227
as myself and herself
are making a tape...

629
00:46:47,327 --> 00:46:48,529
How's it going?
All right?

630
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:50,932
of a few songs down
at Samson's Studios

631
00:46:51,032 --> 00:46:53,265
and I was just wondering, if
you were around next weekend,

632
00:46:53,365 --> 00:46:55,702
for, to, if you'd be
interested in doing it.

633
00:46:55,802 --> 00:46:56,703
A bit of recording?

634
00:46:56,803 --> 00:46:57,704
Bit of recording, yeah?

635
00:46:57,805 --> 00:46:59,206
Yeah, doing Lizzy
stuff. or...?

636
00:46:59,306 --> 00:47:00,941
No, it's not Lizzy,
it's me own songs.

637
00:47:01,041 --> 00:47:02,143
We only do Lizzy.

638
00:47:02,243 --> 00:47:05,164
Really. It's one
of our things.

639
00:47:05,264 --> 00:47:09,084
That sort of stuff. Is it, sort
of rocky Lizzy stuff or...?

640
00:47:09,184 --> 00:47:11,568
- No. No, it's not.
- Yeah,

641
00:47:11,669 --> 00:47:12,754
Singer-songwriter stuff?

642
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:14,087
It's kind of singer-songwriter, yeah.

643
00:47:14,188 --> 00:47:15,556
- Kinda...
- Is it any good?

644
00:47:15,656 --> 00:47:16,557
- Uh...
- It's great.

645
00:47:16,657 --> 00:47:18,059
Is it?

646
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:19,060
Well, look, like I said,

647
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,429
I don't really know
much about them,

648
00:47:20,529 --> 00:47:21,597
but they seem
like nice people.

649
00:47:21,697 --> 00:47:23,165
Yeah. I just have to
call my mother first.

650
00:47:23,265 --> 00:47:24,233
- Then we go.
- Cool.

651
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:25,267
Great, great.

652
00:47:47,356 --> 00:47:48,590
Okay, come on,
we can go.

653
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,693
Cool.

654
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:11,139
Food's ready! Everybody
get your plates ready!

655
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:20,471
- Hello?
- Hi, how are you?

656
00:48:20,571 --> 00:48:23,025
Come on in, kids!
Take a seat!

657
00:48:37,808 --> 00:48:38,976
Everything all right
here, folks?

658
00:48:39,076 --> 00:48:40,444
Yeah, brilliant.

659
00:48:40,545 --> 00:48:41,580
Enjoying the party?

660
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,581
Yeah.

661
00:48:42,681 --> 00:48:43,615
Great to see you here.

662
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:45,117
Can you sing?

663
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:46,551
If you can't sing,
you're out.

664
00:48:46,652 --> 00:48:51,475
# There's one request
I'll ask of you #

665
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:56,812
# When your liberty you gave #

666
00:48:56,912 --> 00:49:01,618
# Remember Mitchell far away #

667
00:49:01,718 --> 00:49:06,558
# A convict bound in chains. #

668
00:49:12,144 --> 00:49:18,098
#... mine that once held
this heart of mine. #

669
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:30,248
# And I love her so #

670
00:49:30,348 --> 00:49:35,568
# I wouldn't trade her
for gold #

671
00:49:37,572 --> 00:49:42,795
# I'm walking on moonbeams #

672
00:49:42,895 --> 00:49:48,445
# I was born
with a silver spoon #

673
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:54,802
# Hell, I'm gonna be me #

674
00:49:54,903 --> 00:49:59,855
# I'm gonna be free #

675
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:06,082
# I'm walking on moonbeams #

676
00:50:06,182 --> 00:50:12,238
# Staring out to sea #

677
00:50:14,209 --> 00:50:19,633
# And if a door be closed #

678
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:24,953
# Then a row of homes
start building #

679
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:32,848
# And tear your curtains down #

680
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:40,069
# For sunlight is like gold #

681
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,606
# Hell, you better be you #

682
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:52,516
Hey.

683
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,664
What are you doing here?

684
00:50:54,764 --> 00:50:57,187
I just came out.
You want to go for a spin?

685
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,421
That's your bike?

686
00:50:58,521 --> 00:50:59,589
It's me dad's.

687
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,291
He absolutely loves it,
but I've robbed it

688
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,393
off him for the day.

689
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:03,694
If he knew,
he'd kill me.

690
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,276
Would he?

691
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:08,662
So do you fancy a spin, no?

692
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:11,802
I'd love to,
but I have to go to work.

693
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,871
That's cool.

694
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:15,940
Another time, yeah?

695
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:20,335
and see if you were
into going now.

696
00:51:22,014 --> 00:51:23,582
Could you have me back by lunch?

697
00:51:23,682 --> 00:51:25,765
Yeah, totally.

698
00:51:25,865 --> 00:51:27,520
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

699
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,519
Fancy it?

700
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,621
Great.

701
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:10,147
You're what?

702
00:52:10,247 --> 00:52:11,331
You're married.

703
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:13,433
Does it surprise you?

704
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:16,370
Fuck's sake.

705
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:20,154
Yeah.

706
00:52:20,254 --> 00:52:21,607
When?

707
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:24,945
Two years ago, when I find out
I'm pregnant with Ivonka.

708
00:52:27,864 --> 00:52:30,832
So where is he?

709
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:32,320
He's back in
Czech Republic.

710
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,673
It's over now and, you know,
I come here on my own.

711
00:52:38,592 --> 00:52:40,594
Man.

712
00:52:43,064 --> 00:52:45,067
You all right?

713
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:58,995
What's the Czech
for 'ocean'?

714
00:52:59,095 --> 00:52:59,982
Ott-san.

715
00:53:00,082 --> 00:53:00,983
Ott-san.

716
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,518
Pretty much the same.

717
00:53:02,618 --> 00:53:04,620
Otsan.

718
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,732
So what are
you gonna do?

719
00:53:10,895 --> 00:53:12,895
I don't know.

720
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,615
There's such distance
between me and him.

721
00:53:18,716 --> 00:53:21,605
He's so much different
to me and so much older.

722
00:53:21,705 --> 00:53:25,960
It doesn't really work.

723
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,946
I'm fine on my own, you know?

724
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:32,980
It's just, I don't want Ivonka
to grow up without a father.

725
00:53:37,722 --> 00:53:41,253
What's the Czech for...
'Do you love him?'

726
00:53:42,393 --> 00:53:43,661
Noor-esh-ho?

727
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,629
Noor-esh-ho?

728
00:53:45,729 --> 00:53:47,297
So...

729
00:53:47,397 --> 00:53:49,399
Noor-esh-ho?

730
00:53:50,935 --> 00:53:52,937
Noor-ho-tebbe.

731
00:53:54,805 --> 00:53:55,673
What?

732
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:57,308
Come on, let's go.

733
00:53:57,408 --> 00:53:58,477
What'd you say?

734
00:53:58,577 --> 00:54:01,313
- Tell me.
- You've got to teach me how to ride

735
00:54:01,413 --> 00:54:03,798
- the bike now, eh?
- No way.

736
00:54:03,898 --> 00:54:04,882
- Yeah.
- No.

737
00:54:04,982 --> 00:54:06,751
So come on, can I have a go?

738
00:54:06,851 --> 00:54:07,752
No.

739
00:54:07,852 --> 00:54:09,054
Please.

740
00:54:09,154 --> 00:54:12,137
No, leave it alone, will you?

741
00:54:12,238 --> 00:54:15,409
But teach me how to
drive it, will you?

742
00:54:15,509 --> 00:54:16,362
Come on, just once.

743
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:17,362
No, it's not mine.

744
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:18,431
Me dad would go
fucking crazy.

745
00:54:18,531 --> 00:54:19,465
But he's not here now.

746
00:54:19,565 --> 00:54:20,465
Be careful, will you!

747
00:54:20,565 --> 00:54:21,934
Be careful,
for fuck's sake.

748
00:54:22,034 --> 00:54:23,268
Look, he's not
here now.

749
00:54:23,368 --> 00:54:25,337
- Just teach me.
- Look, my dad. Look. No, no, no.

750
00:54:25,437 --> 00:54:26,338
- No?
- No.

751
00:54:26,438 --> 00:54:29,359
- Please?
- No.

752
00:54:29,459 --> 00:54:30,877
Me dad will go
bleedin' mental.

753
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:32,445
He totally loves this thing.

754
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:34,281
Yeah, but you drive it.

755
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:35,850
Yeah, he doesn't
know I have it.

756
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:36,851
He doesn't?

757
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:37,950
No.

758
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,887
Well, then he won't
know I had it, too.

759
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:44,308
No.
You can't have a go on it.

760
00:54:44,408 --> 00:54:45,292
Just once.

761
00:54:45,392 --> 00:54:46,293
No.

762
00:54:46,393 --> 00:54:49,646
- Turn it on for me.
- No.

763
00:54:49,746 --> 00:54:50,631
No.

764
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:51,899
Come on, give
us the keys.

765
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,168
I'll do it myself.

766
00:54:53,268 --> 00:54:55,268
The key's in it.

767
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:05,981
Thank you for the ride.

768
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:07,048
I'll see you
tomorrow, yeah?

769
00:55:07,148 --> 00:55:08,583
- For rehearsals.
- Okay, yeah.

770
00:55:08,683 --> 00:55:09,584
Okay.

771
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:11,724
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

772
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:28,833
# Tying to pull myself away #

773
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:38,212
# I'm caught in a pattern
and I can't escape #

774
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:47,725
# I'm trying
to pull myselfaway... #

775
00:55:53,729 --> 00:55:58,817
# Lately, when I get back,
there's this thing I know... #

776
00:55:58,917 --> 00:56:03,588
# Everything comes
to you, way to go #

777
00:56:03,689 --> 00:56:08,795
# Even a heart has
something to learn... #

778
00:56:08,895 --> 00:56:10,881
Thanks, Dad.

779
00:56:12,582 --> 00:56:14,285
All right, guys,
this is Eamon.

780
00:56:14,385 --> 00:56:15,853
He's going to
take care of you

781
00:56:15,953 --> 00:56:16,988
for the weekend.

782
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:18,489
Eamon, this is everyone.

783
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:19,624
Kit's set up.

784
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:22,458
Piano is waiting for you
in the live room.

785
00:56:22,558 --> 00:56:25,229
Tea and coffee in the kitchen
as you came in. Help yourselves.

786
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:26,797
You'll need plenty.

787
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:28,400
And there is a nice
little burrito place

788
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,268
around the corner if you
want a snack, all right?

789
00:56:30,368 --> 00:56:31,270
Great.

790
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:32,604
Okay, Eamon,
leave it to you.

791
00:56:32,704 --> 00:56:33,838
Good luck, everyone.

792
00:56:33,939 --> 00:56:36,509
Enjoy. And I might pop in
later, all right?

793
00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:38,276
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers, thanks.

794
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:40,411
Okay, guys,
good to meet you.

795
00:56:40,511 --> 00:56:41,813
We've a few little
bits and pieces

796
00:56:41,913 --> 00:56:42,847
to set up.

797
00:56:42,947 --> 00:56:44,383
I want to check
the drums inside.

798
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:46,902
We've already set up the kit.

799
00:56:47,002 --> 00:56:50,256
Yeah, I just want to, you know,
check them for sound.

800
00:56:50,356 --> 00:56:52,358
I checked them already; it's fine.

801
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:56,260
Okay, we need to set up mics
on them for recording, yeah?

802
00:56:56,361 --> 00:56:58,063
Oh.

803
00:56:58,163 --> 00:56:59,497
Have you done much recording?

804
00:56:59,597 --> 00:57:00,853
- No.
- No.

805
00:57:00,953 --> 00:57:01,267
No.

806
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:04,346
- Right. Let's get cracking.
- Yeah.

807
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:33,500
Yeah, no, I can't
do it now, love.

808
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,834
I'm stuck here in the studio

809
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:36,536
with this bunch
of fucking oddballs.

810
00:57:36,636 --> 00:57:39,640
Can you hang on a second?
Just one second.

811
00:57:41,443 --> 00:57:42,777
Okay, are you ready to rock?

812
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:43,744
Are we ready?

813
00:57:43,845 --> 00:57:45,847
Yep. We're in tune.

814
00:57:47,481 --> 00:57:49,516
So Al and Timmy,
on the second verse, just...

815
00:57:49,616 --> 00:57:51,652
this is pretty much
simple enough thing.

816
00:57:51,752 --> 00:57:53,254
It's in five-four,
and the second verse,

817
00:57:53,355 --> 00:57:55,257
I'll give you a nod
to come in there, yeah?

818
00:57:55,357 --> 00:57:57,325
Is that all right? And you're in
from the top with me, yeah?

819
00:57:57,425 --> 00:58:00,063
And you know what you're doing.

820
00:58:00,862 --> 00:58:04,615
All right, then, so, uh...

821
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:07,080
whenever you're ready, yeah.

822
00:58:13,442 --> 00:58:15,558
All right, later.

823
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,280
Okay, we're ready. Fire one.

824
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,081
You sure you're ready?

825
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:22,550
Okay, listen now for
the click track, everybody.

826
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,052
And away we go.

827
00:58:24,152 --> 00:58:28,976
This is track one,
take one, yeah.

828
00:58:29,076 --> 00:58:32,887
All right, lads, here we go,
this is it, yeah.

829
00:58:49,813 --> 00:58:53,168
# So #

830
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:57,802
# If you want something #

831
00:58:57,902 --> 00:59:01,642
# And you call, call #

832
00:59:01,742 --> 00:59:05,675
# Then I'll come running #

833
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,482
# To fight #

834
00:59:08,582 --> 00:59:12,266
# And I'll be at your door #

835
00:59:13,437 --> 00:59:21,333
# When there's nothing
worth running for #

836
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:25,431
# When your mind's made up #

837
00:59:25,531 --> 00:59:29,534
# When your mind's
made up #

838
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:33,340
# There's no point
trying to change it #

839
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,612
# When your mind's made up #

840
00:59:37,712 --> 00:59:41,180
# When your mind's
made up #

841
00:59:41,281 --> 00:59:45,590
# There's no point
trying to stop it #

842
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:48,090
# You see #

843
00:59:48,191 --> 00:59:52,895
# You're just like everyone #

844
00:59:52,995 --> 00:59:56,766
# When the shit falls #

845
00:59:56,867 --> 01:00:02,385
# All you want to do
is run away #

846
01:00:04,657 --> 01:00:08,208
# And hide all by yourself #

847
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:11,947
# When you're far from me #

848
01:00:12,047 --> 01:00:17,052
# There's nothing else #

849
01:00:17,152 --> 01:00:20,923
# When your mind's made up #

850
01:00:21,024 --> 01:00:24,693
# When your mind's
made up #

851
01:00:24,793 --> 01:00:28,633
# There's no point trying
to change it #

852
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:32,667
# When your mind's made up #

853
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:36,773
# When your mind's
made up #

854
01:00:36,873 --> 01:00:40,543
# There's no point
even talking #

855
01:00:40,643 --> 01:00:44,551
# When your mind's made up #

856
01:00:44,651 --> 01:00:48,583
# When your mind's
made up #

857
01:00:48,684 --> 01:00:52,425
# There's no point
trying to fight it #

858
01:00:52,525 --> 01:00:56,761
# When your mind's #

859
01:00:56,861 --> 01:01:04,869
# Your mind's #

860
01:01:04,969 --> 01:01:08,905
# Made #

861
01:01:09,005 --> 01:01:11,053
# Up... #

862
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:24,092
# Ah #

863
01:01:24,192 --> 01:01:27,793
# There's no point trying
to change it #

864
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:35,868
# When your #

865
01:01:35,968 --> 01:01:44,267
# 0h #

866
01:01:51,770 --> 01:02:00,745
# Ooh, ooh #

867
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:09,653
# So... if you ever
want something #

868
01:02:11,489 --> 01:02:15,744
# And you call, call #

869
01:02:15,844 --> 01:02:20,065
# Then I'll come running. #

870
01:02:27,339 --> 01:02:29,108
Okay.

871
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:30,943
Wow.

872
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:33,045
That was nice.

873
01:02:33,946 --> 01:02:35,582
Did you write that?

874
01:02:35,682 --> 01:02:37,685
Yeah.

875
01:02:43,322 --> 01:02:48,478
# You must have
fallen from the sky #

876
01:02:48,578 --> 01:02:51,466
# You must have shattered
in the runway #

877
01:03:19,828 --> 01:03:24,150
# You need somewhere
to fall apart #

878
01:03:28,819 --> 01:03:31,819
# Someone to fall upon #

879
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,967
# That fools the bulls #

880
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,018
# The powdered hag #

881
01:04:22,642 --> 01:04:25,609
Okay, what do you think?

882
01:04:25,709 --> 01:04:27,946
I think it's fucking weird.

883
01:04:28,047 --> 01:04:31,570
There's a couple of little tech bits,
we can probably fix them,

884
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:35,006
but uh, you know, it's 4:00 in the morning,
so it's up to you guys.

885
01:04:35,106 --> 01:04:38,478
Do you want to push through
or go for another one?

886
01:04:38,578 --> 01:04:41,145
I'd love to keep going
if everybody is into it.

887
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:43,347
Can I have a cup of tea
or something first?

888
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:45,116
Want a cup of tea?

889
01:04:45,216 --> 01:04:47,920
- You want to take ten or 15, yeah?
- Sure.

890
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,421
I'll tweak what I can.

891
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:50,923
You guys take ten.

892
01:04:51,023 --> 01:04:55,644
Guys, why do you think there
are no blonde priests?

893
01:04:55,744 --> 01:04:58,280
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

894
01:05:19,685 --> 01:05:21,688
This is great.

895
01:05:46,314 --> 01:05:48,314
How's it going?

896
01:05:50,383 --> 01:05:52,052
Good.

897
01:05:52,152 --> 01:05:54,321
I don't think we're supposed
to be here, though.

898
01:05:54,422 --> 01:05:56,903
Ah, it's all right.

899
01:05:57,004 --> 01:05:58,426
This is beautiful, isn't it?

900
01:05:58,526 --> 01:06:00,863
Yeah, it's a beautiful piano,
like a Baldwin.

901
01:06:00,963 --> 01:06:02,030
It's a perfect piano.

902
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,432
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

903
01:06:03,532 --> 01:06:07,617
Play us one of your songs.

904
01:06:07,717 --> 01:06:11,406
Hmm... They're
all half-written and more ideas.

905
01:06:11,506 --> 01:06:13,889
Go on, I'd love to hear one.

906
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:17,413
Okay, I have one,

907
01:06:17,513 --> 01:06:21,064
but... it's not finished and I...

908
01:06:21,165 --> 01:06:22,350
I don't really...

909
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:23,518
Just play it, I know.

910
01:06:23,618 --> 01:06:25,286
Okay, but the lyrics
are very rough, okay?

911
01:06:25,386 --> 01:06:28,051
- It'll be great.
- Okay.

912
01:06:42,538 --> 01:06:48,363
# Walking up the hill
tonight #

913
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:53,821
# When you have closed
your eyes #

914
01:06:57,252 --> 01:07:02,076
# I wish I didn't have
to make #

915
01:07:02,176 --> 01:07:07,626
# All those mistakes
and be wise #

916
01:07:11,136 --> 01:07:16,459
# But please try
to be patient #

917
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:22,543
# And know
that I'm still learning #

918
01:07:25,817 --> 01:07:31,742
# I'm sorry
that you have to see #

919
01:07:31,842 --> 01:07:36,731
# The strength inside me
burning #

920
01:07:39,899 --> 01:07:46,056
# And where are you,
my angel, now? #

921
01:07:46,156 --> 01:07:52,914
# Don't you see me crying? #

922
01:07:54,312 --> 01:07:59,535
# I know that you can't
do it all #

923
01:07:59,636 --> 01:08:06,189
# But you can't say
I'm not trying #

924
01:08:08,227 --> 01:08:13,715
# And I'm letting myself down #

925
01:08:13,815 --> 01:08:20,578
# By satisfying you #

926
01:08:22,642 --> 01:08:28,569
# I really wish
that you could see #

927
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:30,651
# I... #

928
01:08:43,798 --> 01:08:46,314
You all right?

929
01:08:47,902 --> 01:08:49,237
Did you write that
for your husband?

930
01:08:49,337 --> 01:08:50,573
Yes, I did,

931
01:08:50,673 --> 01:08:52,141
and he didn't like it.

932
01:08:52,241 --> 01:08:53,809
What an idiot.

933
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:55,912
Yeah, he's an idiot.

934
01:09:22,072 --> 01:09:25,392
Come on away to London with me.

935
01:09:25,492 --> 01:09:28,046
Come on, we'll write loads of
songs and live in a nice flat.

936
01:09:28,146 --> 01:09:29,680
You can bring Ivonka over,
it'll be brilliant.

937
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,113
Come on.

938
01:09:31,214 --> 01:09:32,848
Yeah, we'll go to London

939
01:09:32,949 --> 01:09:35,052
and no one will ever
find us again.

940
01:09:35,152 --> 01:09:36,252
- No one.
- No one.

941
01:09:36,353 --> 01:09:37,688
We'll have a brilliant band.

942
01:09:37,788 --> 01:09:39,824
We'll sell out all the places
and it'll be great.

943
01:09:39,924 --> 01:09:41,659
And we'll make
an album together?

944
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,194
I'd love that, come on.

945
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,662
Yeah, and, and I'll do

946
01:09:44,762 --> 01:09:45,763
the backing vocals on it?

947
01:09:45,864 --> 01:09:46,999
Yeah, and play
the piano.

948
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,264
Mm-hmm.

949
01:09:48,364 --> 01:09:49,699
Come on, I'm serious.

950
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:51,801
Can I bring my mother?

951
01:09:57,408 --> 01:10:00,403
Well, we should go back
to work.

952
01:10:02,814 --> 01:10:04,816
- Yeah.
- Okay.

953
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:21,526

954
01:10:24,535 --> 01:10:26,138
What day is it today?

955
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:27,706

956
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:29,758
Monday.

957
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:32,879
I think it's time we did
the, uh, the car test.

958
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,881
What's the car
test, Eamon?

959
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,017
We've been listening
back on these, uh,

960
01:10:37,117 --> 01:10:38,552
big studio speakers.

961
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:41,787
So it's time we had a go
on some shitty speakers.

962
01:10:41,887 --> 01:10:42,956
So...

963
01:10:43,056 --> 01:10:44,123
All right, let's go.

964
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,392
Let's go for a spin
and have a listen in me car.

965
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:47,660
Great, man.

966
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:48,996
- Yeah.
- Go have a ride, yeah?

967
01:10:49,096 --> 01:10:51,048
Let's go.

968
01:10:51,148 --> 01:10:54,697
We'll clear this up later.

969
01:10:55,736 --> 01:10:57,687
Timmy!

970
01:10:57,787 --> 01:11:00,219
Timmy!

971
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:01,275
Come on.

972
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,377
Beauty.

973
01:11:10,518 --> 01:11:12,520
Beauty.

974
01:11:13,089 --> 01:11:15,089
All right.

975
01:13:28,845 --> 01:13:30,131
There they are.

976
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:32,432
Listen, man, fucking...

977
01:13:32,532 --> 01:13:33,832
- Well done.
- It sounds fucking brilliant.

978
01:13:33,933 --> 01:13:35,969
- Thanks a lot for your help.
- Lots of luck with those.

979
01:13:36,069 --> 01:13:37,405
- Nice one.
- I just pressed the buttons.

980
01:13:37,505 --> 01:13:38,472
It was great.

981
01:13:38,572 --> 01:13:39,706
Nice, man, thank you.

982
01:13:39,806 --> 01:13:41,676
- Cool.
- You two go and get some sleep.

983
01:13:41,776 --> 01:13:42,743
Right, nice one.

984
01:13:42,843 --> 01:13:46,162
- And thanks very, very much.
- See you.

985
01:13:52,186 --> 01:13:53,721
So this is it.

986
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:55,689
- Yeah.
- We did it.

987
01:13:55,789 --> 01:13:57,425
It sounds great.

988
01:13:57,525 --> 01:13:58,659
It does, doesn't it?

989
01:13:58,759 --> 01:13:59,828
Could I have one?

990
01:13:59,928 --> 01:14:01,263
- Yeah, yeah, totally.
- Thank you.

991
01:14:01,363 --> 01:14:03,682
I've got to
go this way.

992
01:14:03,782 --> 01:14:05,717
Really.

993
01:14:05,818 --> 01:14:07,718
Where you going?

994
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,770
Home.

995
01:14:11,106 --> 01:14:12,240
You don't want
to come back?

996
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,342
I'll make you breakfast.

997
01:14:13,442 --> 01:14:14,976
- We could listen to the CD, no?
- No.

998
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:18,414
I have to go see Ivonka
and organize things.

999
01:14:18,514 --> 01:14:19,682
So do you.

1000
01:14:19,782 --> 01:14:20,817
Yeah.

1001
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:22,319
You're leaving.

1002
01:14:22,419 --> 01:14:24,369
To London.

1003
01:14:24,469 --> 01:14:25,854
What do you have
to organize?

1004
01:14:25,954 --> 01:14:27,022
What's, what's that about?

1005
01:14:27,122 --> 01:14:29,993
I, I spoke to my
husband last night.

1006
01:14:30,093 --> 01:14:31,260
He's coming over.

1007
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,162
Ah, brilliant.
Fair play-That's great.

1008
01:14:33,262 --> 01:14:34,897
- I'm really happy for you.
- It's good. Yeah.

1009
01:14:34,997 --> 01:14:37,148
We'll try to
make it work.

1010
01:14:37,248 --> 01:14:38,469
It's for the best.

1011
01:14:38,569 --> 01:14:39,770
Yeah.

1012
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:41,837
Come back and hang out,
have a cup of tea.

1013
01:14:41,937 --> 01:14:43,273
It's the last day.
We'll hang out.

1014
01:14:43,373 --> 01:14:45,884
Whatever, breakfast, whatever.

1015
01:14:45,984 --> 01:14:47,009
Listen to the tunes.

1016
01:14:47,109 --> 01:14:48,978
Or you can come over later,
whatever.

1017
01:14:49,079 --> 01:14:51,065
For what?

1018
01:14:51,165 --> 01:14:52,816
What do you mean, what?

1019
01:14:52,916 --> 01:14:54,851
Just hang, just come
and hang out.

1020
01:14:54,951 --> 01:14:56,488
But we done our work.

1021
01:14:56,588 --> 01:14:57,820
Why would I go over?

1022
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,898
We'd just hanky panky
If I come now.

1023
01:15:01,891 --> 01:15:03,293
What?

1024
01:15:03,393 --> 01:15:05,395
Hanky panky?

1025
01:15:06,129 --> 01:15:07,798
It won't be for hanky panky.

1026
01:15:07,898 --> 01:15:09,901
I know it would.

1027
01:15:11,903 --> 01:15:14,655
And that would be nice.

1028
01:15:14,755 --> 01:15:15,873
Would it?

1029
01:15:15,973 --> 01:15:18,075
- Hanky... Would it?
- Very interesting.

1030
01:15:18,175 --> 01:15:21,171
Be worthless though.

1031
01:15:24,483 --> 01:15:27,455
Come back later.

1032
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:31,491
Mmm.

1033
01:15:35,293 --> 01:15:37,095
Okay, I'll come.

1034
01:15:37,195 --> 01:15:38,464
Yeah?

1035
01:15:38,564 --> 01:15:39,731
I'll come later, yeah.

1036
01:15:39,831 --> 01:15:41,200
Brilliant.

1037
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,368
You sure?

1038
01:15:42,468 --> 01:15:43,736
Brilliant.

1039
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:44,870
All right, then...

1040
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:46,839
Cool. See you after.
Well done.

1041
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:48,942
You, too.

1042
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:11,467
Well, what do you think?

1043
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:17,547
You like it?

1044
01:17:17,647 --> 01:17:19,975
It's just a demo,
you know...

1045
01:17:20,075 --> 01:17:21,404
It's fucking brilliant.

1046
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:22,672
Really?

1047
01:17:22,773 --> 01:17:24,725
Fantastic stuff.

1048
01:17:24,825 --> 01:17:27,729
That'll be a hit, no question.

1049
01:17:27,829 --> 01:17:30,293
When are you off?

1050
01:17:30,393 --> 01:17:32,283
What?

1051
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:35,017
Well, I've a few hundred quid
for you

1052
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,572
for a deposit on a place.

1053
01:17:37,672 --> 01:17:39,623
Going to come over
and see you

1054
01:17:39,723 --> 01:17:41,725
when you're settled in.

1055
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,194
When do you think
you'll be able to go?

1056
01:17:46,998 --> 01:17:48,900
I'm going tomorrow, Dad.

1057
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,950
Good man.

1058
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:52,670
About time.

1059
01:17:56,674 --> 01:17:58,626
Will you be all right?

1060
01:17:58,726 --> 01:18:00,678
What do you mean?

1061
01:18:02,615 --> 01:18:06,850
I was all right for years
before you came along, wasn't I?

1062
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:09,219
I don't have to go now.
I can put this thing off

1063
01:18:09,319 --> 01:18:11,055
- for a few months.
- Go.

1064
01:18:11,156 --> 01:18:12,657
And the best

1065
01:18:12,757 --> 01:18:14,392
of luck, son.

1066
01:18:14,492 --> 01:18:16,027
Thanks, Dad.

1067
01:18:16,127 --> 01:18:19,259
Make your ma proud.

1068
01:18:22,436 --> 01:18:24,335
Now play it again.

1069
01:18:24,435 --> 01:18:27,670
Okay.

1070
01:18:27,939 --> 01:18:28,873
That's good.

1071
01:18:28,973 --> 01:18:30,443
Yeah. I recorded a few songs.

1072
01:18:30,543 --> 01:18:32,678
Oh, yeah? What are they like?

1073
01:18:32,779 --> 01:18:34,280
They're good.
I'm happy with them.

1074
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:37,099
Great.

1075
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,199
I've missed you.

1076
01:18:39,299 --> 01:18:41,434
Yeah, me, too.

1077
01:18:41,534 --> 01:18:44,023
Do you want me
to meet you at the airport?

1078
01:18:44,123 --> 01:18:45,659
No. I'll come find you.

Want to buy
