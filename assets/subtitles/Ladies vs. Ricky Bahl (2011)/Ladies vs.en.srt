Hello uncle
- l have told her so many times.

91
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:01,960
Uncle, there's a lot of weight here,

92
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,298
Let me put her down
first then, you can scold me.

93
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:07,562
l think she can answer your
questions only in the morning.

94
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:08,833
Who are you?

95
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,705
Sunny. Boyfriend.

96
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:13,102
l am a trainer at the
Power house gym. GK branch.

97
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:14,779
Dimple and l met there.

98
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:16,810
Upstairs would be better?

99
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,976
Aunty

100
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:20,143
You are a body builder, right?

101
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:37,833
So body builder, now tell me,
what did you do to my daughter?

102
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:43,136
Had l done something l wouldn't
have brought her back in one piece.

103
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:46,368
Out here they are killed
and stuffed into an oven.

104
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,107
l respect you a lot Sir,

105
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,508
Dimple has told me
everything about you,

106
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:54,378
self-made man...

107
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:56,379
To start from a garage...

108
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:58,685
...and establish such a huge
property empire is no joke.

109
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:03,889
l wanted to meet you myself,
but not like this.

110
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,292
With a presentation of a plan for
a chain of All-lndia Gymnasiums...

111
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:13,137
anyway not now, you must be tired.

112
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:15,469
l'll make an
appointment and meet you later.

113
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,171
l am your daughter's boyfriend.

114
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,540
l won't do anything wrong.

115
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:29,079
Trust me.

116
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,182
Should l park the car inside?

117
00:09:32,258 --> 00:09:33,350
How will you go home?

118
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:36,160
Bus, auto, l'll take anything,
l left my bike at the gym.

119
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,264
Take the car and bring
it back in the morning,

120
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:42,090
but don't get even a scratch on it.

121
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:44,732
l won't get a scratch on it,

122
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:47,071
Not on the car nor on your daughter.

123
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:49,734
Good night Sir, aunty...

124
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:51,035
Good night, son

125
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:56,472
l had to brush four times to
get rid of the Vodka smell.

126
00:09:56,582 --> 00:09:58,641
What if papa had caught me? And you?

127
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:00,784
Walked out making a good impression,

128
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:01,979
and making me look like a fool.

129
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,580
Couldn't you stop me when
l was chugging the shot?

130
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,090
What happened? Why did we stop?

131
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,618
Should l get off?

132
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:18,828
What're you doing Sunny?

133
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:21,569
What're you doing Sunny?

134
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:23,100
Where you going Sunny?

135
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,302
Bloody murderers,

136
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,845
finished off my mother and father,

137
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:31,912
you will rot in this house.

138
00:10:34,954 --> 00:10:37,514
Why are you throwing stones?

139
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:40,385
Broken all the panes, you die...

140
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,359
Shut up, you bitch,

141
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:44,991
Netarpal! Netarpal! Oye, Rawat!

142
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:47,359
Catch him, don't let him go.

143
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:49,196
Run Sunny Run

144
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:00,940
Start the bike,

145
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,474
go go go...

146
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,608
Where are you running? Stop.

147
00:11:56,702 --> 00:11:57,794
Sorry.

148
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:00,832
Sunny, tell me the full story.

149
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:05,543
You've lost 3 kilos,
you deserve a chocolate.

150
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:07,576
l am leaving.
- Listen...

151
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:14,677
You have enough problems of your own,

152
00:12:14,787 --> 00:12:15,947
why do you want to hear mine?

153
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,989
you call me your girlfriend,

154
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,750
can't even share your
problems with your girlfriend?

155
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:37,500
That house is mine

156
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:40,737
Yours?

157
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,246
My grandfather built it,

158
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:46,979
papa was born there...

159
00:12:47,753 --> 00:12:50,813
when my grandfather got transferred,
he put the house up for rent.

160
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,948
And when he came back those Mother...

161
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:59,060
those MFs did not leave the house.

162
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:03,267
My grandfather filed a case.

163
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:06,227
Fighting the case, he died first

164
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:08,867
then my father and then mother,

165
00:13:09,274 --> 00:13:11,105
along went the entire bank balance.

166
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:15,235
After three deaths the court
ruled in favour of the tenants

167
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:17,680
under the Rent Control Act of 1947.

168
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:22,716
Now, they pay only 1,500
rupees rent for such a big house

169
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:25,585
and l pay a property tax
of 60 thousand every year

170
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:27,324
and if l don't pay up then
l get an arrest warrant.

171
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:34,693
l am sorry, l didn't mean to grumble.

172
00:13:53,452 --> 00:13:55,420
Your pain, my pain

173
00:13:57,055 --> 00:14:00,684
No, you look best laughing.

174
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:03,589
Don't get involved in my tears.

175
00:14:04,363 --> 00:14:06,194
We will all laugh together,

176
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:08,261
and make those MFs cry.

177
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:11,327
How?

178
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:13,896
Good evening Dimple ma'am

179
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,169
Papa help, there is big crisis.

180
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:18,834
Dimple? Mr. Kamal is here.

181
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:21,579
Uncleji, can you step out please?

182
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,147
Mr. Chaddha, what's this nonsense?

183
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:24,307
2 minutes please

184
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:26,180
Not nonsense! l am Dimple Chaddha.

185
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:27,513
This shop is named after me.

186
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:29,281
l am telling you
politely to wait outside,

187
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:30,946
once our meeting is done then,
you can have your's.

188
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:32,615
OK? Happy? Out!

189
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:35,953
Papa, help us.

190
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:38,960
Us? Means?
- Me and Sunny. Ours.

191
00:14:39,031 --> 00:14:40,623
Get Sunny back his bungalow.

192
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:42,390
Sunny has a bungalow?

193
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,828
Yes, on Barakhamba Road.

194
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:50,731
Sunny owns a
bungalow on Barakhamba Road?

195
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,771
Where do you think you are entering?

196
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:57,541
Throw this out

197
00:14:57,816 --> 00:14:58,908
Throw this out as well

198
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:05,012
Take this, break this, come on.

199
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:40,388
Uncle can l have a look inside?

200
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:43,093
Of course, it's your bungalow,
you are the landlord.

201
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:44,253
You are the king.

202
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:47,460
Dimple!
- Yes mom?

203
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,500
No issues, have a good look.

204
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:56,538
lt's a proper bungalow.

205
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:57,867
Nice, isn't it?

206
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,704
lt's cute. lt has an old world charm.

207
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,110
Come up stairs, there's more.

208
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:03,406
Ya lets go

209
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:06,814
From where?
- Come from here.

210
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:07,977
We are going upstairs.

211
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:15,760
Papa made this map himself.

212
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:19,053
He was born in this room.

213
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,928
Papa Sunny's father was born here,

214
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:26,095
it's so exciting isn't it?

215
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:29,574
But the condition of the
house is not very exciting.

216
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:30,733
That's not the point uncle.

217
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:35,140
l am sure, Papa and Papa's papa
are both thanking you from there

218
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:40,212
you made it possible for his son
and his grandson to stand here.

219
00:16:40,986 --> 00:16:42,112
Son's son.

220
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:44,079
You won't be standing for long.

221
00:16:44,723 --> 00:16:51,026
lt's best you sell this while
the market is still piping hot,

222
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,597
No uncle this house
has an emotional value.

223
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:58,534
Two crores, it will fetch,
just like that.

224
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:00,698
With a constantly leaking roof,

225
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:02,168
these seeping walls,

226
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,537
you will always need security here.

227
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:05,570
How will you manage on your salary?

228
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:08,212
Sell it.

229
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,415
Buy a 4 BHK flat for
1 crore in a suburb

230
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:13,350
Either in Gurgaon or Greater Noida.

231
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:16,011
and with the rest start a gym.

232
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:18,713
You can't be a trainer
all your life, can you?

233
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:20,216
lsn't it a plan?

234
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:24,825
Pamme, get the bag...

235
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:31,124
Now where will you run
around selling-buying?

236
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:33,398
Fine this will be on my own head.

237
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:36,401
No l can't trouble you.

238
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:38,869
Dimple's problem, my problem.

239
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:48,511
20 Lakhs advance, rest 180,
after the deal is done.

240
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:50,446
Done?

241
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:54,450
Done?

242
00:17:58,764 --> 00:17:59,856
Done.

243
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:01,123
Superb!!

244
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,599
Will you keep staring at
the cash or will you hug me?

245
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:06,796
Not her, me!

246
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:11,701
Bye, Sunny

247
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:19,283
You don't care if it's
a friend or an enemy.

248
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:23,619
You've taken his 8 crore
house forjust 2 crores!

249
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:25,720
He is our Dimple's boyfriend!

250
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:28,855
So he's not going to be
a boyfriend forever...

251
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:30,019
Papa!

252
00:18:30,228 --> 00:18:32,696
l mean, soon he will
become the son-in-law...

253
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:35,155
and everything will be his...

254
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:37,126
right Dimple?

255
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:47,103
What is this nonsense, Sharma?

256
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:48,611
lt's not nonsense, it's a warrant.

257
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:52,107
You entered my house
and beat up my people.

258
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:54,377
Arrest him.

259
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:57,253
You say it's yours and
l should believe you?

260
00:18:58,156 --> 00:19:00,716
Mr. Sharma l've bought it, legally,
from Sunny Singh.

261
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:03,060
An advance has been paid,
the entire paper work is ready,

262
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:08,222
l even have the original
map made by poor Sunny's dad.

263
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:11,135
Only the registration is left.
- Registration is not possible.

264
00:19:11,236 --> 00:19:13,466
Why is not possible? - Not possible
because, a family feud...

265
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:15,005
...has been going on
since my father's death.

266
00:19:15,474 --> 00:19:17,135
A stay order has been
imposed on that house.

267
00:19:17,476 --> 00:19:20,468
lf you have a map l have the
original documents for this property.

268
00:19:21,012 --> 00:19:23,207
l don't see any Sunny Singh in these.

269
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:25,841
l think he's tucked you up.

270
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:38,456
Listen carefully.
- Yes sir.

271
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,861
Call Surti...

272
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:41,831
Tell him before sunset my bail
should be done before sunset.

273
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:46,096
lf l have to spend even
one night in jail, believe me

274
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:48,196
l'll have everyone
buried in this market itself.

275
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,133
Papa, where are you going?

276
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,611
Papa what happened ? Sharma Uncle?

277
00:19:57,682 --> 00:20:00,242
The Urban Ministry's secretary
happens top be my brother-in-law.

278
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:02,710
He'll usurp my bungalow.
- Put him in there...

279
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,449
Papa, don't be scared, l'll
be there with Mummy and Sunny

280
00:20:05,524 --> 00:20:08,891
lf you meet Sunny again l'll
break your legs. No meeting Sunny.

281
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:10,186
Let's go Sharma.

282
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:11,520
Why Papa?

283
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,398
No he was Anup's substitute.

284
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:20,494
He was to leave on Friday,
but he left three days early.

285
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,439
But Anup will be back on Friday.

286
00:20:24,075 --> 00:20:25,474
But it looks like
Sunny really suited you.

287
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:27,036
You're looking fit.

288
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,710
What're you scared of?

289
00:21:06,818 --> 00:21:10,948
Why don't you give your papa,
that picture of Sunny, you took?

290
00:21:11,823 --> 00:21:14,223
Dad will kill me if l
even step in front of him.

291
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:17,623
Thank God he got out on bail today,
or else it would be my neck.

292
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,493
l am sure even your dad
wants his 20 Lakhs back right?

293
00:21:19,831 --> 00:21:21,662
Give it. Your dad will find him.

294
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,963
He's not going to get us
married even if he finds Sunny.

295
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:26,930
Papa is going to kill him
in the centre of the market.

296
00:21:27,772 --> 00:21:29,967
Now a Sunny-Dimple
match is impossible.

297
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:32,609
You're impossible.
Still dreaming of Sunny.

298
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:34,076
lt's Papa's fault as well.

299
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,541
Sunny hatched a clever plan...

300
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:36,740
...but Papa should
have been a bit smart too.

301
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:38,077
Why was he duped?

302
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:40,376
l love him Gurmi.

303
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:41,881
You are crazy Dimple...

304
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:58,265
At times, one has to lose to win,

305
00:21:59,604 --> 00:22:02,835
and that player is
'The Ultimate Winner'

306
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:55,588
Beware oh ladies

307
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,851
l am wicked.

308
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:01,558
Oh ladies

309
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:06,160
l do my misdeeds...

310
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:10,469
Oh ladies.

311
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:12,701
You like it or not

312
00:23:12,777 --> 00:23:14,574
Here l come.

313
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:16,804
l steal your hearts

314
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:19,179
What can be done?

315
00:23:19,284 --> 00:23:21,980
Can't help my self ladies?

316
00:23:23,421 --> 00:23:24,911
Can't help my self ladies?

317
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:27,048
That's just my way!

318
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,151
Can't help my self ladies?

319
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:31,195
That's just my way!

320
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:39,626
l can't help myself!

321
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:29,749
My bio-data is twisted

322
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:33,480
Penned with lipstick.

323
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:38,322
l want to be debited in

324
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,163
every ladies bank account.

325
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:44,560
Oh Yes oh yes oh yes

326
00:24:44,636 --> 00:24:46,627
l bow thee my head.

327
00:24:46,704 --> 00:24:48,763
Then l steal your heart

328
00:24:48,873 --> 00:24:51,171
That's my bet.

329
00:24:51,276 --> 00:24:53,801
Can't help my self ladies.

330
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:56,870
Can't help my self ladies

331
00:24:56,981 --> 00:24:59,074
That's just my way!

332
00:24:59,484 --> 00:25:01,111
Can't help my self ladies.

333
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:03,177
That's just my way!

334
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:11,595
l can't help myself!

335
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,052
l steal the shadow from your eye

336
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:48,789
So smooth am l.

337
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,858
l enter like a breeze

338
00:25:50,969 --> 00:25:53,836
And exit like a storm

339
00:25:54,038 --> 00:25:57,303
Hey guys, that's just my form.

340
00:25:57,508 --> 00:25:59,806
l can open every vault.

341
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:01,675
l am very well known.

342
00:26:01,946 --> 00:26:04,005
Then l steal your heart.

343
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:06,346
Ladies that's not my fault.

344
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:09,181
Can't help my self ladies.

345
00:26:10,588 --> 00:26:12,078
Can't help my self ladies

346
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,454
That's just my way!

347
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:16,282
Can't help my self ladies

348
00:26:16,394 --> 00:26:18,385
That's just my way!

349
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:26,667
l can't help myself!

350
00:27:28,466 --> 00:27:30,798
Fifty printers for seventy five lakhs!

351
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:33,262
We had orders to get the best.

352
00:27:33,371 --> 00:27:34,838
Of course you had to get the best.

353
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:36,439
Best at the right price!

354
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:40,303
Did someone put a gun to your head
to get it at the seller's price?

355
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:44,310
You are the buyer, you fix
the price. Buyer is king.

356
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:46,745
l am sorry Raina. - l can't
take the blame for every mistake.

357
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,685
The bosses will punish the culprit.

358
00:27:49,754 --> 00:27:51,585
So be ready to be fired.

359
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,958
lf you speak to him, he won't fire us

360
00:27:54,058 --> 00:27:57,892
Please cry in your
cubicle not here. OK?

361
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:01,122
Listen everyone market is tough,

362
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:03,497
'Smart ones stay, ldiots sent away'

363
00:28:03,901 --> 00:28:05,892
Smart or idiot you choose.

364
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:08,430
The rest is all good...thanks.

365
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:15,239
Sir, yes Sir, coming Sir.

366
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:18,815
Fire the interior designer.

367
00:28:19,217 --> 00:28:22,243
Sir.
- He has left such a huge blank space.

368
00:28:23,187 --> 00:28:26,486
l want Hussain's horses on this wall.

369
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,685
At any cost.

370
00:28:32,663 --> 00:28:35,029
You have an impressive reputation,
Raina Parulekar.

371
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,730
You can make the impossible,
possible...

372
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:41,829
So will there be a Hussain on
the wall on the inauguration day?

373
00:28:42,507 --> 00:28:43,599
Yes Sir.

374
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:51,381
Yes, Nikhil Sir.
- What about the Hussain?

375
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:53,072
Oh, they are quoting 5 crores

376
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:54,618
That's too expensive.

377
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:57,483
l know, l am trying
other art galleries as well.

378
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:58,647
OK.

379
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,295
Yes? - Ma'am the painting you asked
for will be available next month.

380
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:08,388
No, no, no, l need it in 72 hours.
- But Ma'am...

381
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:10,991
What will l do with it after a month?
Put it in my bedroom?

382
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:13,860
Will an Anjolie Raman do?

383
00:29:13,938 --> 00:29:15,496
No, Anjolie Raman won't do.

384
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:17,035
l need a Hussain. Only a Hussain.

385
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:19,101
Moron.

386
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:41,631
Move it, what's going on?

387
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:44,901
Lady, lady... relax... please...

388
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,362
l am honking at the truck, not you,

389
00:29:47,438 --> 00:29:48,496
so mind your own business.

390
00:29:48,606 --> 00:29:50,597
The truck is mine
and so is the business.

391
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:52,670
You look like the transport type guy!

392
00:29:53,044 --> 00:29:54,477
Now move it, l am getting late.

393
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:57,070
lt won't move till
everything is off-loaded.

394
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:58,614
Keep honking

395
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,718
Careful! Careful! Careful!

396
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,981
lt's not a painting, it's a Hussain.

397
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:07,849
M. F. Hussain. lt's a masterpiece.

398
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:09,719
Do you know how much it's worth?

399
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:11,926
lf something happens to it then...

400
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:14,297
Carefully
- Yes Sir.

401
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,229
Just be careful! Easy does it!

402
00:30:18,903 --> 00:30:22,703
One second. How much is it?

403
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:27,970
Five bucks for 100 grams.
Eat in or take away?

404
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,512
Okay, l know it's not peanuts.
lt's art, creative and all that,

405
00:30:34,986 --> 00:30:36,214
but how much are you selling it for?

406
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:41,322
lt's an exhibition for art lovers.

407
00:30:42,894 --> 00:30:44,020
Over here?

408
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:47,258
My gallery, lndigo. The
opening is this evening.

409
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:53,962
lnvitation. Come over if
you are interested in art...

410
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:55,430
lf you want to buy spicy peanuts

00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,701
then the Mithibai
College has the best chutney.

412
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:04,006
ldiot!

413
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:08,051
lndigo... lndigo... lndigo...

414
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:12,012
Deven ldiot Shah...

415
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:17,360
Market value Rs. 80 lakhs.

416
00:31:18,596 --> 00:31:19,722
Not for sale!

417
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:22,556
Why not for sale Mr. Shah?

418
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:26,561
Why not?

419
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:45,781
Looking for the price tag?

420
00:31:47,992 --> 00:31:49,619
5 bucks for 100 grams, freshly baked.

421
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:56,690
Ninety lakhs... Deal?

422
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,234
And l thought you were
genuinely interested in art.

423
00:32:03,874 --> 00:32:05,774
lt's to decorate the office.

424
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:09,338
What?

425
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,638
l like honest...

426
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:11,840
l hate fake.

427
00:32:13,651 --> 00:32:15,209
lt's impossible to buy.

428
00:32:15,286 --> 00:32:16,753
Nothing is impossible.

429
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:19,649
Honestly. The
painting isn't mine to sell.

430
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:22,657
lt's borrowed from the Suri
brothers for the exhibition.

431
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:26,354
Mr. Suri Steel and Power Suri?
- Yes.

432
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:28,662
Manoj and Maneesh Suri. Joint owners.

433
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,467
Couldn't you have said that earlier?

434
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:32,227
You wouldn't have been here then.

435
00:32:33,104 --> 00:32:34,833
You would've found
someone else to flirt with.

436
00:32:38,776 --> 00:32:40,676
l can set up your
meeting with the Suris.

437
00:32:41,012 --> 00:32:43,207
lf you can convince them,
you can have your painting.

438
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:44,543
And you your commission.

439
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:47,076
lt's a hard-earned commission,
no cheating.

440
00:32:50,254 --> 00:32:51,380
Raina Parulekar

441
00:32:51,455 --> 00:32:52,547
Deven Shah...

442
00:32:53,524 --> 00:32:54,616
Call me Dev.

443
00:32:55,192 --> 00:32:57,126
Deven, if possible it would be better

444
00:32:57,228 --> 00:32:58,695
to have a meeting
with the older brother.

445
00:32:59,096 --> 00:33:01,291
His position is weaker,

446
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,564
he will surrender faster.

447
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:08,538
Surrender! To Raina the tigress...

448
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,339
The meeting should happen tomorrow.

449
00:33:11,942 --> 00:33:15,241
The day after the painting has to
be up in office for the opening.

450
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,715
At such short notice, only a
phone conversation will be possible.

451
00:33:19,884 --> 00:33:21,818
Phone is good... Bye then...

452
00:33:39,236 --> 00:33:41,670
Sir, l need the financial
stats of Suri Power and Steel...

453
00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:43,331
Buying-selling ratios...
last quarter...

454
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:46,542
Forget about the Suri's,
Raina, we are two days away.

455
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:48,901
Concentrate on the Hussain.

456
00:33:50,915 --> 00:33:52,348
l am focused on that sir.

457
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,225
Hello?
- ls this Raina Parulekar?

458
00:34:08,532 --> 00:34:12,662
Yeah. - l am calling from Mr. Manoj
Suri's office, to inform you that

459
00:34:12,737 --> 00:34:15,365
Mr. Suri is not interested in
selling his Hussain painting.

460
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:19,333
Oh, but we are offering
more than its market value.

461
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:21,477
l don't know ma'am,
it's Mr. Suri's decision.

462
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:23,911
l am just conveying
the message. Thank you.

463
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:27,439
Wait, wait, wait... can you
let me talk to him please?

464
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,983
My boss's orders,
l have to get that painting.

465
00:34:31,122 --> 00:34:32,180
Please

466
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:33,887
Okay...

467
00:34:34,392 --> 00:34:36,883
only an employee can
understand another.

468
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:38,820
l will try...

469
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:48,801
Hello. Manoj Suri here.

470
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:50,970
We will not sell that painting.

471
00:34:51,642 --> 00:34:54,042
Hussian is the pride and
glory of Suri Steel and Powers.

472
00:34:54,145 --> 00:34:56,010
Hussain is the life of our company.

473
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,776
Mr. Suri, the market value of
the painting is Rs.80,00,000.

474
00:34:59,316 --> 00:35:00,977
We are ready to pay 90.

475
00:35:01,085 --> 00:35:02,211
You are ready, l am not.

476
00:35:02,653 --> 00:35:03,779
One crore

477
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:05,515
lt's an insult to Mr. Hussain.

478
00:35:05,723 --> 00:35:07,350
One crore twenty final.

479
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,050
You are insulting me...

480
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:12,121
lt's your younger brother
who is going to insult you.

481
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:13,288
What do you mean by that?

482
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:18,597
You and me both know
that your brother wants

483
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:22,662
to take 51 percent of the shares

484
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:26,536
so he can sideline and
eventually oust you.

485
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:28,435
There's bound to be a
spilt in the company

486
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:30,607
and its assets.

487
00:35:32,016 --> 00:35:34,678
Will the Hussain be yours or his?

488
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:41,649
Who would've thought that one's
own brother would deceive them?

489
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,519
lf we pay you half in cash,

490
00:35:44,995 --> 00:35:47,259
the rest 60 Lakhs by cheque...
with receipt,

491
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:50,525
which will officially
make the price 60 Lakhs.

492
00:35:50,835 --> 00:35:55,772
Half of which will be your
cheating brother's part,

493
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,034
making his total 30 lakhs,

494
00:35:57,308 --> 00:35:59,071
and your share 90 lakhs.

495
00:35:59,577 --> 00:36:01,340
l hope causing him a loss of 90 lakhs

496
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:04,279
will be give you some
sort of... how do say it?

497
00:36:04,348 --> 00:36:05,440
Peace...

498
00:36:06,283 --> 00:36:08,615
yes it will give some peace.

499
00:36:10,521 --> 00:36:11,613
So, deal?

500
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,191
Yes, but give the lndigo broker,
his commission on the full price.

501
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:18,818
Why should he incur losses
in my fight with my brother?

502
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:22,394
Mr. Manoj Suri... you
are a very nice man.

503
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:25,433
l know l know...

504
00:36:26,237 --> 00:36:28,034
anyway, take the
painting from the gallery,

505
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:30,100
give the boy his commission

506
00:36:30,407 --> 00:36:33,467
and also hand him my
suitcase with cash in it.

507
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:36,277
Get the cheque sent to
my office by speed post.

508
00:36:36,814 --> 00:36:37,906
Are you sure?

509
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:40,445
Hand over 60 lakhs in
cash to that Dev guy?

510
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:43,976
He is a sweet simple chap,
he won't even open the bag.

511
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:45,587
Okay, bye.

512
00:36:52,596 --> 00:36:54,461
Yes! Yes! Yes!

513
00:36:54,565 --> 00:36:57,033
Careful, guys please.

514
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:03,830
Tigress Parulekar,

515
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,801
so you made Suri surrender.

516
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:09,070
Worked that magic. Very nicely done.

517
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,804
There is no such thing as magic.

518
00:37:11,615 --> 00:37:12,843
Honest, hard work.

519
00:37:13,717 --> 00:37:15,275
A cheque for your commission,
-Thank you.

520
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,209
and this briefcase for Mr. Suri

521
00:37:19,423 --> 00:37:20,515
lt will reach him.

522
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:21,683
All clear between us?

523
00:37:22,526 --> 00:37:23,618
All clear.

524
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,705
Cheers to Raina!

525
00:37:38,075 --> 00:37:39,201
To Hussain!

526
00:37:40,644 --> 00:37:43,238
Since his death it's
become more precious.

527
00:37:43,314 --> 00:37:44,440
Sir Mr. Suri...

528
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:45,914
Manoj Suri?
- Yes sir.

529
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:49,112
Please tell me, when
are you getting here?

530
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:50,744
Forget that, first tell me

531
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:52,755
how did you set claims
on my Hussain painting?

532
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,255
We never had any deal,

533
00:37:54,825 --> 00:37:56,258
What rumors are you spreading?

534
00:37:56,894 --> 00:37:57,986
Hello...

535
00:37:58,062 --> 00:38:00,360
Call Raina... Now!

536
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:02,399
Yes sir.
- The painting is not a fake, Sir...

537
00:38:03,634 --> 00:38:04,931
Mr. Suri is confused.

538
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:08,198
Mr. Suri is the owner
of Suri Power and Steel,

539
00:38:08,939 --> 00:38:11,237
not a desperate manager level employee

540
00:38:11,308 --> 00:38:14,038
who will use cheap
tricks to get ahead.

541
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:18,974
Not a cheap trick, Sir.
l only followed your orders.

542
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:22,246
The orders were to get a
genuine painting, not a fake.

543
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,548
How will l justify such a big scam?

544
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:29,587
Not a scam, Sir...

545
00:38:31,695 --> 00:38:32,821
mistake

546
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,022
Really?

547
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:38,090
And who will prove
it's a mistake or a scam?

548
00:38:40,938 --> 00:38:42,303
l'll prove it, Sir.

549
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:46,074
You'd better Raina Parulekar.

550
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,802
You'd better

551
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:11,000
At times, one has to lose to win,

552
00:39:11,568 --> 00:39:14,833
and that player is
'The Ultimate Winner'

553
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,611
Raina Parulekar, someone
has conned your company

554
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:23,941
and sold a fake
Hussain painting to you.

555
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:25,440
How are you feeling?

556
00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:27,449
There is speculation that
it's not a con but a scam,

557
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:28,609
and you are involved in it too.

558
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,987
Do l look like a scamster?
Am l a thief?

559
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:36,825
l have a B Tech degree
from llT, and an MBA from llM.

560
00:39:36,894 --> 00:39:39,192
Raina don't, let the
lawyers handle it.

561
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:40,820
No, Sir, let me speak.

562
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,601
l am an honest employee of
Synergy Communications...

563
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:49,634
l love my job, this company.

564
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,571
l will never con my bosses,

565
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:54,804
l've been conned.

566
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:58,143
A man called Deven
Shah has conned me...

567
00:39:58,515 --> 00:40:01,484
Surely this is not his
real name or his first con

568
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:04,110
For him it was just a
way to make a quick buck

569
00:40:05,055 --> 00:40:06,283
but for me

570
00:40:06,957 --> 00:40:09,949
my honesty, my identity,
my commitment,

571
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,290
my job, my future all is at stake.

572
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:14,353
l am going to track him down,
recover the company's money,

573
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:16,729
get him arrested and prove he

574
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,802
is the criminal and l am innocent.

575
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,672
Yeah?

576
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:32,108
Raina from Mumbai?

577
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,442
Who is this?

578
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:35,712
Dimple from Delhi.

579
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:37,753
You have the wrong Raina,
l don't know any Dimple...

580
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:39,618
Parulkar na... Raina Parulkar.

581
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:42,552
Paru... lekar.

582
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:43,888

583
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:45,155

584
00:40:45,429 --> 00:40:49,126

00:41:08,852 --> 00:41:11,286
Yes, Deven Shah is Sunny Singh...

588
00:41:11,755 --> 00:41:13,814
Did he also make you his
girlfriend and dump you?

589
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:15,825
l am stupid but not that much.

590
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:17,185
You mean l am stupid?

591
00:41:19,163 --> 00:41:20,653
l didn't let it get to that.

592
00:41:20,764 --> 00:41:23,164
But he conned me for 60 lakhs.

593
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:26,828
Lol! 60! He could only get 20 from me.

594
00:41:26,937 --> 00:41:28,302
You are more stupid than l am.

595
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:31,364
OK, l am more stupid than you.

596
00:41:33,844 --> 00:41:35,505

No l am at home.

603

Have those horrible people fired you?

604
00:41:55,365 --> 00:41:58,163
Who are you? Questions upon questions,

605
00:41:58,235 --> 00:41:59,327
Where are you calling from?

00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,938
Lucknow. My name is Saira...

607
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:07,305
Six months ago a man named lqbal Khan

608
00:42:07,377 --> 00:42:09,937
cheated me of 10 lakh rupees.

609
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:11,640
and he disappeared thereafter

610
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:15,610
l'm not sure if lqbal and
your painting guy are the same

611
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:18,182
but if you could tell me more...

620
00:42:45,782 --> 00:42:47,340
You are really smart Dimple.

621
00:42:47,451 --> 00:42:48,941
Raina? Did you hear that?

622
00:42:49,286 --> 00:42:51,015
Saira, tell me the truth,

623
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:52,680
did he make you his
girlfriend as well?

624
00:42:53,824 --> 00:42:55,587

After three years Adil
died in an accident.

630
00:43:14,411 --> 00:43:17,141
His parents are just
as nice as he was.

631
00:43:17,948 --> 00:43:20,473
l've been with them
for the last two years.

632
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,983
So when did you meet Sunny?

633
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:24,153
While going to my shop in the morning.

634
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:26,950
Stop stop.

635
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:31,923
No hell would break lose if you stop.

636
00:43:40,504 --> 00:43:42,438
Hey, don't touch them.

No way.

640
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:14,700
They look so sweet,

641
00:44:15,672 --> 00:44:16,934
but taste like poison.

642
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:26,282
Ticket!

643
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,844
Pass!

644
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:29,078
Pass... don't say it, show it.

645
00:44:33,724 --> 00:44:35,749
What happened? Has the pass failed?

646
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:37,292
l left my purse at home.

647
00:44:37,728 --> 00:44:39,423
Show your pass, or buy a ticket.

648
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,298

667
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:25,092
He had done his research.

668
00:46:25,168 --> 00:46:28,262
From which bus stop, and
at what time l take the bus.

669
00:46:28,338 --> 00:46:32,297
Which area the shop is in,
what time it opens, everything.

670
00:46:45,755 --> 00:46:46,915
By buying of the ticket,

671

00:47:09,713 --> 00:47:14,412
My mind had glazed over, l smiled
and led him right into the shop.

00:47:15,118 --> 00:47:18,110
Royal Cloth Merchant. Our shop's name.

679
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:19,680
My name is lqbal

00:47:20,157 --> 00:47:21,385

681
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,152
What's the rate?

682
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:26,490
Rupees 450 a meter.

683
00:47:26,563 --> 00:47:28,895
He even chose the right
time to enter the shop,

684
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:30,091
Greetings.
- Greetings.

685
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:33,102
he knew my father-in-law brings
lunch at that time. - Greetings.

686
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,229
Just as father entered,
he began showing off

687
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:36,862
his knowledge about fabrics.

688
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,066
Khan, lqbal Khan.

689
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:39,301
lt took him hardly ten minutes

690
00:47:39,376 --> 00:47:42,174
to have my father
wrapped around his finger.

691
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,339
Tie-dye is popular here?

692
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:48,546
Yes. There's an entire
colony for the tie-dye.

693
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:50,415
Which way would that colony be?

694
00:47:50,487 --> 00:47:51,886
Which way would that colony be?

695
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:53,047
lt's through the by lanes,

696
00:47:53,156 --> 00:47:54,248
you'll get lost if go on your own.

697
00:47:54,925 --> 00:47:58,417
l would've shown you had the
property tax guy not been coming.

698
00:47:59,062 --> 00:48:01,292
Saira why don't you show him?

699
00:48:01,765 --> 00:48:02,857

00:48:02,933 --> 00:48:05,493
Ya go ahead. l'll manage here.

701
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:08,396
OK.

702
00:48:10,674 --> 00:48:13,973
While he was showing his
fake sympathy and kindness,

703
00:48:14,077 --> 00:48:17,604
l was melting like an idiot.

704
00:48:18,381 --> 00:48:19,507
Cold drink?

705
00:48:20,116 --> 00:48:21,242
lce cream?

706
00:48:30,427 --> 00:48:31,951
Shall l show you something?

707
00:48:35,098 --> 00:48:38,795
Allah... the Pandora's
box is opening today.

708
00:48:40,337 --> 00:48:41,429
What is this?

709
00:48:41,504 --> 00:48:42,766
Real intricate threadwork Zardozi.

710
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:45,733
l've never seen such
intricate work before.

711
00:48:45,842 --> 00:48:47,469
We have our own workshop in Bareli,

712
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:50,145
traditional weavers.

713
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:54,608
As there are no
sales in smaller towns,

714
00:48:55,218 --> 00:48:58,779
my friends said that
Lucknow would be the right place.

715
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:03,520
Now the dealers here
show interest but not cash.

716
00:49:05,762 --> 00:49:08,697
l am almost through
with the money l had.

717
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:15,665
Back home my mother and
both my sisters are worried.

718
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:20,473
l'd better head back home.

719
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:25,074
lsn't it exquisite?

720
00:49:27,317 --> 00:49:28,875
What are you quoting for this?

721
00:49:28,952 --> 00:49:30,351
400 rupees a meter

722
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,719
No one is ready to pay
even 400. Such swindlers!

723
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,417
And they will sell it for a 1,000.

724
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:38,460
Your losses won't be a profit to us!

725
00:49:39,896 --> 00:49:41,921
But 400 is too low my friend.

726
00:49:42,532 --> 00:49:44,432
l'll give you 500 rupees a meter

727
00:49:45,435 --> 00:49:46,732
And l'll place an
order for 5,000 meters.

728
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:50,837
10 lakhs advance... and the
balance of 15 lakhs on delivery.

729
00:49:51,174 --> 00:49:52,300
Agreed?

730
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:55,708
Poor father, he struck
the deal blindly for me.

731
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,876
Hoping that this friendship would

732
00:49:57,981 --> 00:50:00,950
turn into a relationship,
and end my loneliness.

733
00:50:01,017 --> 00:50:03,542
Have some sweets to celebrate.

734
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,712
Wow

735
00:50:04,821 --> 00:50:06,880
The following day father
gave him 10 lakhs, cash.

736
00:50:06,956 --> 00:50:09,652
He promised to
return in two weeks time.

737
00:50:10,994 --> 00:50:13,861
Wring the Zardozi
Saree around his neck

738
00:50:14,197 --> 00:50:16,290
and hang him in the city centre.

739
00:50:16,366 --> 00:50:18,800
That's provided we find him.

740
00:50:19,135 --> 00:50:23,572
You guys have his photo why
don't you inform the police?

741
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:26,809
lf he gets to know the
police are looking for him

742
00:50:26,876 --> 00:50:29,367
he will go underground, and
we will never get our money.

743
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,577
No police.

744
00:50:32,716 --> 00:50:34,377
Look, l have a plan.

745
00:50:35,352 --> 00:50:37,820
Everything will be
possible if we join forces.

746
00:50:38,254 --> 00:50:39,414
Why don't both of you come down?

747
00:50:39,522 --> 00:50:41,012
lt's impossible for me.

748
00:50:41,091 --> 00:50:43,787
Papa has imposed various bans on me.

749
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,454
Fine then sit in your homes,

750
00:50:46,563 --> 00:50:48,724
and let more Sunnys and
lqbals make fools out of you.

751
00:50:49,766 --> 00:50:50,858
Bye.

752
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:08,943
Go

753
00:51:12,689 --> 00:51:14,350
lt has been bothering me too.

754
00:51:15,925 --> 00:51:19,452
But then l didn't say
anything thinking about Adil.

755
00:51:20,897 --> 00:51:22,262
l was wrong...

756
00:51:22,866 --> 00:51:25,562
But even if Adil is not
here anymore... you are.

757
00:51:29,372 --> 00:51:32,569
No, you are not going on any trip.

758
00:51:32,675 --> 00:51:34,734
Gurmi, Puchki, Choti are all going.

759
00:51:36,312 --> 00:51:39,907
Well no bodybuilder in their
house has swindled them of 20 lakhs.

760
00:51:40,617 --> 00:51:41,777
lf l have done something wrong once

761
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:43,284
it doesn't mean l'll
be doing it all my life.

762
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:45,014
Even you have made many mistakes.

763
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:48,921
Weren't you conned in the
Bhatia shop deal, for 12 Lakhs?

764
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:51,460
The Pancholi Bunglaow,
the Preet Vihar flats,

765
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:52,823
but did you shut down your property...

766
00:51:52,896 --> 00:51:54,124
...business because of your mistakes?

767
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,993
You've grounded me!

768
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:59,233
l never thought you'd play such a
double standard game with me Papa.

769
00:52:02,272 --> 00:52:03,739
Let her go.

770
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:12,945
Dimpy, will you travel
business class or economy?

771
00:52:24,761 --> 00:52:25,887
Raina!

772
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,322
Dimple?

773
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:30,059
Come on, l've been
waiting for so long.

774
00:52:30,366 --> 00:52:31,492
But l was right here.

775
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:33,763
But you didn't come in front of me...

776
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:35,430
Okay, sorry.

777
00:52:37,207 --> 00:52:38,299
Nice glares...

778
00:52:38,608 --> 00:52:39,734
Aren't they?

779
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:49,011
Are you still in mourning for Sunny?

780
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:50,177
No.

781
00:52:50,253 --> 00:52:51,550
So why black-black?

782
00:52:52,288 --> 00:52:53,380
l like black.

783
00:52:53,456 --> 00:52:54,548
l like colour...

784
00:52:55,158 --> 00:52:56,284
Suits you.

785
00:52:57,227 --> 00:52:58,956
Saira's flight arrived before yours.

786
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:00,887
She hasn't even
switched on her phone yet.

787
00:53:00,997 --> 00:53:02,897
l am Saira

788
00:53:05,935 --> 00:53:07,425
You run a shop?

789
00:53:08,972 --> 00:53:10,064
Yes Dimple.

790
00:53:10,673 --> 00:53:11,765
Hello Raina

791
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,001
Hello

792
00:53:21,117 --> 00:53:22,243
Let's go.

793
00:53:23,953 --> 00:53:25,511
How did you guess l was Dimple?

794
00:53:25,822 --> 00:53:29,121
You're very special,
people know you instantly.

795
00:53:39,102 --> 00:53:42,435
Okay so how will we
get our money from Sunny?

796
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:43,931
From lqbal

797
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,532
Dev, lqbal, Sunny whatever
from that Bloody Scoundrel...

798
00:53:47,844 --> 00:53:50,608
ldea. His name will
be Bloody Scoundrel

799
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,977
to avoid any confusion.

800
00:53:52,749 --> 00:53:55,377
To extract money from
the Bloody Scoundrel

801
00:53:55,451 --> 00:53:57,146
we will con that con.

802
00:53:58,288 --> 00:54:00,279
Con what con?

803
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:04,824
Con means to cheat.

804
00:54:05,695 --> 00:54:09,028
He cheated us, now we will cheat him.

805
00:54:09,132 --> 00:54:11,965
We will plant a bait in front of him.

806
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,600
Our bait will pretend
that she has a great

807
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:18,767
investment proposal to multiply money.

808
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:22,140
Bloody Scoundrel will
invest his money in that,

809
00:54:22,211 --> 00:54:24,907
and through our bait we
will get our money back.

810
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:27,709
Simple.

811
00:54:27,784 --> 00:54:30,548
Simple? Who will be 'The Bait'?

812
00:54:31,054 --> 00:54:32,146
There is one.

813
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,621
l have someone in mind.

814
00:54:58,982 --> 00:55:00,711
Through the thorns,

815
00:55:00,783 --> 00:55:02,683
pluck the roses

816
00:55:03,052 --> 00:55:06,749
snip the dreams, from
the tree of snoozes.

817
00:55:09,859 --> 00:55:12,327
Through the thorns,

818
00:55:12,428 --> 00:55:14,157
pluck the roses

819
00:55:14,497 --> 00:55:18,092
snip the dreams, from
the tree of snoozes.

820
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:21,996
Many a tales, of hopes to look.

821
00:55:22,271 --> 00:55:26,139
pick any story, and leave the book.

822
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:29,973
Faded are the colors of life,

823
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,845
follow your heart all the way through,

824
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:36,476
till it changes your point of view.

825
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:40,147
Let out your passion

826
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:43,851
Let out your passion

827
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,821
Let out your passion

828
00:56:31,741 --> 00:56:35,905
Pat a little...

829
00:56:36,145 --> 00:56:39,637
awaken your lazy dreams.

830
00:56:39,749 --> 00:56:43,617
lt's your play...

831
00:56:43,686 --> 00:56:47,520
Fight through the difficult way.

832
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:49,455
What will be, will be

833
00:56:49,525 --> 00:56:51,493
Don't worry you will see.

834
00:56:51,561 --> 00:56:55,327
Restrain, not your dreams

835
00:56:55,398 --> 00:56:59,027
ride the waves of destiny

836
00:56:59,102 --> 00:57:02,902
Just sail out your boat and go,

837
00:57:02,972 --> 00:57:05,770
Even your stars will shine and glow.

838
00:57:13,382 --> 00:57:17,045
Let out your passion

839
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,453
Let out your passion

840
00:57:21,023 --> 00:57:24,754
Let out your passion

841
00:57:51,287 --> 00:57:52,982
Cabinets up, cabinets down.

842
00:57:53,089 --> 00:57:54,886
Cabinets down, cabinets up.

843
00:57:54,991 --> 00:57:56,891
Lots and lots of cabinets.

844
00:57:56,959 --> 00:57:59,951
Everything in its cabinet,
in its place.

845
00:58:00,029 --> 00:58:02,964
After chasing targets
in the office all day,

846
00:58:03,032 --> 00:58:05,227
you don't want to chase the
boxes of rice and curry at home?

847
00:58:06,002 --> 00:58:08,994
Perfect modular kitchen for
a perfect professional couple.

848
00:58:09,338 --> 00:58:11,636
Sir, you just need
to choose the color,

849
00:58:11,741 --> 00:58:13,732
our engineers will fit every piece.

850
00:58:13,843 --> 00:58:15,276
They can even cook
if you want them to...

851
00:58:15,378 --> 00:58:16,868
...but l can't guarantee the taste.

852
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,844
Like l said,
HomeTown makes life easier.

853
00:58:21,117 --> 00:58:23,779
When you get promoted
please invite me to dinner.

854
00:58:23,853 --> 00:58:25,878
Sudesh will help you...

855
00:58:25,955 --> 00:58:27,047
Please pay at the counter,

856
00:58:27,123 --> 00:58:28,215
Thank you.

857
00:58:30,393 --> 00:58:31,485
Hello...

858
00:58:31,561 --> 00:58:33,028
Raina Ma'am...
- Hey...

859
00:58:33,863 --> 00:58:36,627
wow, you are glowing...

860
00:58:36,966 --> 00:58:39,457
l know, l know... the sensex
must have gone up like a rocket.

861
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:40,695
How much profit have you booked for?

862
00:58:40,803 --> 00:58:41,895
Celebrating again?

863
00:58:42,538 --> 00:58:44,267
We've just received
exquisite wine glasses from Venice.

864
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,773
Hand blown glass... what a finish...

865
00:58:45,842 --> 00:58:48,310
even lndian wine
tastes like French in it.

866
00:58:48,411 --> 00:58:49,708
No, lshika, l don't need...

867
00:58:49,779 --> 00:58:53,010
No no, you can't repeat
glasses from the last party.

868
00:58:53,082 --> 00:58:55,312
What will your guests think?
Raina is such a miser!

869
00:58:55,384 --> 00:58:58,444
Ohh, l'm so sorry, Your friends?

870
00:58:58,554 --> 00:59:00,317
Hi, l am lshika and you are...?

871
00:59:00,423 --> 00:59:01,913
Saira...

872
00:59:02,225 --> 00:59:03,283
Dimple Chaddha...

873
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:06,321
Dimple Dude l have just
the right thing for you...

874
00:59:06,562 --> 00:59:07,654
Ma'am l will just attend to her,

875
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:08,924
and then the glasses

876
00:59:24,547 --> 00:59:29,484
Peeler, slicer, chopper, masher
- all in one. Cool, isn't it?

877
00:59:29,719 --> 00:59:32,654
Very cool, but what are
you going to do with it?

878
00:59:33,689 --> 00:59:34,815
Me?

879
00:59:37,526 --> 00:59:38,652
Me?

880
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,592
You were right,

881
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:45,095
she is awesome.

882
00:59:48,671 --> 00:59:49,763
Bloody chameleon.

883
00:59:55,678 --> 00:59:56,770
Return seven rupees.

884
00:59:56,846 --> 00:59:59,007
No change, if you guys
get so petty then...

885
00:59:59,081 --> 01:00:00,207
You guys means?

886
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:01,677
My money hangs off tress?

887
01:00:02,118 --> 01:00:03,176
Hey, lshika!

888
01:00:05,021 --> 01:00:06,147
Raina Ma'am,

889
01:00:06,756 --> 01:00:07,848
get out.

890
01:00:19,302 --> 01:00:21,566
Will you keep eating... say something

891
01:00:22,838 --> 01:00:23,896
Coffee please.

892
01:00:23,973 --> 01:00:25,099
Yes Ma'am.

893
01:00:31,113 --> 01:00:32,671
Frankly l am not surprised.

894
01:00:33,516 --> 01:00:35,484
lt's so easy to con you guys,

895
01:00:35,952 --> 01:00:37,283
check out the bills from yesterday.

896
01:00:37,386 --> 01:00:39,854
We bought it only to check you out.

897
01:00:40,156 --> 01:00:42,317
Fine agreed about yesterday,

898
01:00:43,092 --> 01:00:44,719
l con Raina every week,

899
01:00:45,561 --> 01:00:46,721
and you get conned.

900
01:00:47,196 --> 01:00:50,529
Till yesterday we were Ma'am
and today we are first names?

901
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:53,898
lf we work together we will be
equals right, then why ma'am?

902
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:55,130
So are you doing it?

903
01:00:56,038 --> 01:00:57,198
lf l do it...

904
01:00:59,508 --> 01:01:00,770
how much time will it take?

905
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:02,670
A month or two.

906
01:01:03,245 --> 01:01:06,339
No way, l've finished my paid leave.

907
01:01:06,649 --> 01:01:08,617
To do this l'll have to take time off.

908
01:01:09,285 --> 01:01:10,775
l get paid 30 thousand a month.

909
01:01:10,853 --> 01:01:13,481
Five lakhs... your fee,

910
01:01:14,256 --> 01:01:15,848
and all expenses paid.

911
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,089
What if he is a psycho-rapist?

912
01:01:25,201 --> 01:01:26,634
He is not a rapist...

913
01:01:27,203 --> 01:01:28,465
actually he is very nice.

914
01:01:28,838 --> 01:01:31,830
He is only interested in money.
Cold calculated unemotional...

915
01:01:32,141 --> 01:01:33,904
What pain his con causes

916
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:35,709
is no concern to him.

917
01:01:39,415 --> 01:01:41,076
l am doing my job well...

918
01:01:41,817 --> 01:01:43,182
getting paid well,

919
01:01:44,053 --> 01:01:45,350
no one to check on me...

920
01:01:46,889 --> 01:01:48,151
con a con?

921
01:01:48,224 --> 01:01:50,249
Let it be... Excuse me.
- Fine...

922
01:01:51,627 --> 01:01:52,685
l will do it...

923
01:01:54,263 --> 01:01:57,721
Yes let's show that
scoundrel what pain means.

924
01:01:58,067 --> 01:02:01,298
But how will we find the scoundrel?

925
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:04,703
That you leave to Raina!

926
01:02:08,711 --> 01:02:12,545
This number is issued to
Anjum Rizwi not Sunny Singh.

927
01:02:12,848 --> 01:02:15,817
Delhi, prepaid, March last year...

928
01:02:16,852 --> 01:02:19,286
Check this... Lucknow... October...

929
01:02:21,757 --> 01:02:25,818
Parampal Yadav... not
lqbal Khan... prepaid.

930
01:02:27,129 --> 01:02:28,221
And this one.

931
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:33,028
Prepaid. Mumbai.

932
01:02:33,636 --> 01:02:34,728
October.

933
01:02:35,037 --> 01:02:36,163
Rahul Khanna.

934
01:02:36,272 --> 01:02:38,740
Hopeless, they are
all different names,

935
01:02:38,841 --> 01:02:40,172
how can we find him like this?

936
01:02:40,543 --> 01:02:41,737
Patience my sweety.

937
01:02:42,611 --> 01:02:43,771
You're Bournvita...

938
01:02:43,846 --> 01:02:46,144
Okay, now the three numbers
have the same caller tune...

939
01:02:46,215 --> 01:02:48,115
At times, one has to lose to win,

940
01:02:48,217 --> 01:02:49,411
and that player is
'The Ultimate Winner'

941
01:02:49,485 --> 01:02:50,577
so what?

942
01:02:50,653 --> 01:02:52,086
Most people choose songs...

943
01:02:52,188 --> 01:02:54,179
very few ring tones have dialogues.

944
01:02:54,690 --> 01:03:00,526
Now you get a list of all
prepaid numbers with this caller tune.

945
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:03,628
Let's see how
ultimate a winner you are.

946
01:03:04,366 --> 01:03:06,994
Raina Ma'am you are wicked!

947
01:03:16,245 --> 01:03:18,338
Ladies, wake up.

948
01:03:19,348 --> 01:03:20,781
Here is your list,

949
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,512
it has seven names.

950
01:03:25,621 --> 01:03:29,387
All the best, l hope in the
Ladies vs. Bloody Scoundrel,

951
01:03:29,458 --> 01:03:31,926
the Scoundrel loses
and the ladies win.

952
01:03:31,994 --> 01:03:33,086
Thank you bye-bye.

953
01:03:36,065 --> 01:03:37,157
Ready?

954
01:03:38,534 --> 01:03:39,626
Bismillah.

955
01:03:41,604 --> 01:03:47,406
Amandeep Chandigarh. 9915682870

956
01:03:50,045 --> 01:03:51,171
lt's ringing...

957
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,372
Hello?

958
01:03:52,481 --> 01:03:53,914
Amandeep you're a guy or a girl?

959
01:03:54,016 --> 01:03:55,244
You're an aunty or an uncle?

960
01:03:55,351 --> 01:03:56,750
Your dad's the uncle!
- Dimple

961
01:03:58,087 --> 01:03:59,748
No speaking. Just listen.

962
01:04:00,156 --> 01:04:01,555
Takes all sorts

963
01:04:01,924 --> 01:04:03,050
Next.

964
01:04:04,527 --> 01:04:06,324
Hello? Who is it? (in Gujarati)

965
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:09,822
Shailen Sharma Bilaspur

966
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,527
Has the consignment arrived?

967
01:04:14,336 --> 01:04:15,633
Diego Vaz. Goa.

968
01:04:16,272 --> 01:04:18,536
l'll do it, she can't even dial.
Never gets through.

969
01:04:29,852 --> 01:04:31,979
So what? You didn't get
through the first time either.

970
01:04:32,054 --> 01:04:33,248
Next

971
01:04:35,524 --> 01:04:37,253
Where are you hiding Scoundrel?

972
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,933
The fourth guy Dimple
called is calling back.

973
01:04:50,005 --> 01:04:51,131
Diego Vaz.

974
01:04:53,108 --> 01:04:54,200
Hello?

975
01:04:55,044 --> 01:04:56,136
Hello?

976
01:04:57,646 --> 01:04:58,738
Hello?

977
01:05:05,221 --> 01:05:06,620
The Bloody Scoundrel is in Goa!

978
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:36,768
This is your planning?

979
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,075
Had we told Papa, he would've
booked us into a five-star hotel.

980
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:45,479
Miss Dimple, l wish your papa
had financed this entire operation.

981
01:06:46,152 --> 01:06:47,449
We would've stayed
in a five-star hotel,

982
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,181
hired a Mercedes, thank you.

983
01:06:49,522 --> 01:06:53,083
But l'm very sorry, this is all l
could manage with my small savings.

984
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:55,389
lshika's fee, food, transport,

985
01:06:55,494 --> 01:06:57,428
everyone's tickets, chips,
cold drinks.

986
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:59,191
But it's not an obligation, right,

987
01:06:59,298 --> 01:07:00,856
once we get money from that
Bloody Scoundrel? - Volume!

988
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:02,760
When we get the money
from Bloody Scoundrel,

989
01:07:02,835 --> 01:07:05,599
you will take your cut first
and then give us ours, right?

990
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,769
lf we get and when we get...

991
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,603
and what if we don't?

992
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:14,512
Don't be negative.

993
01:07:15,214 --> 01:07:16,511
lt's going to be fine.

994
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:18,976
God willing.

995
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:25,383
Wow... what a great bed.

996
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,392
The two of us can fit in easily.

997
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,386
That room.

998
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:31,763
Why? Aren't we roomies?

999
01:07:31,831 --> 01:07:35,289
Sweetie, first you stop snoring
then you and l can be roomies.

1000
01:07:35,601 --> 01:07:36,727
Till then, Saira and l are here.

1001
01:07:36,836 --> 01:07:38,133
Okay, rules:

1002
01:07:39,105 --> 01:07:40,970
This is my friend
Sasha's house, not a hotel.

1003
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:46,439
We have to leave it in a
better condition than it is now.

1004
01:07:47,947 --> 01:07:49,642
The maid comes in
the morning to clean,

1005
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:51,473
but no one says
anything in front of her.

1006
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:56,879
The rest of the work will be
divided equally between us.

1007
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,024
Why didn't you specify earlier
that we'd have to be maids as well?

1008
01:08:01,427 --> 01:08:02,553
Change the SlM card.

1009
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:06,322
Don't even know how to change a card.

1010
01:08:06,766 --> 01:08:08,961
That's why you're still
a Manager and not General Manager.

1011
01:08:14,974 --> 01:08:17,238
At times, one has to lose to win,

1012
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:19,400
and that player is
'The Ultimate Winner'

1013
01:08:19,879 --> 01:08:20,971
Ya?

1014
01:08:22,047 --> 01:08:25,710
Hello, l have a problem with my laptop

1015
01:08:25,818 --> 01:08:29,652
and l was wondering
when l could come by to get it fixed.

1016
01:08:29,722 --> 01:08:30,814
Wrong number.

1017
01:08:30,923 --> 01:08:34,484
Hello, hello Ashley...
Ashley Rodriguez?

1018
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,257
l am not Ashley Rodriguez ...

1019
01:08:36,328 --> 01:08:37,454
l am Diego Vaz.

1020
01:08:37,763 --> 01:08:40,789
But my friend gave me this number

1021
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:44,233
and told me you're
very good with computers.

1022
01:08:44,336 --> 01:08:46,861
You live in Cavelossim, right?

1023
01:08:46,972 --> 01:08:48,269
l don't fix computers, ma'am...

1024
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,103
l work at the water
sports shack at The Pallazzo.

1025
01:08:50,342 --> 01:08:51,434
lf you'd like to...

1026
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:55,306
Let's go...

1027
01:09:38,624 --> 01:09:40,489
What a body.

1028
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:02,002
Oh, excuse me.

1029
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:06,409
Yes, ma'am? - Can you give
me a dry towel, Mr. Shankar?

1030
01:11:06,478 --> 01:11:07,672
Sure, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1031
01:11:24,163 --> 01:11:25,858
Come on, come on,
come on. Keys! The keys.

1032
01:11:26,065 --> 01:11:27,293
Let's go, let's go...

1033
01:11:29,435 --> 01:11:31,198
Dimple you can drive, right?

1034
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:33,170
Drive? l'll fly.
- open it.

1035
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:22,846
He seems lonely,

1036
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,621
not even a soul to
share a meal with him.

1037
01:12:27,026 --> 01:12:28,459
How do we know there is no one?

1038
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:29,919
No!

1039
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:31,856
He's never getting into that trap.

1040
01:12:32,231 --> 01:12:35,564
So then what is he is doing
here alone with all our money?

1041
01:12:35,901 --> 01:12:37,163
Looking for another victim l guess...

1042
01:12:38,237 --> 01:12:40,467
had he found one he
wouldn't have been in Goa.

1043
01:12:47,246 --> 01:12:48,372
Hello lshika.

1044
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:49,740
We found the Scoundrel.

1045
01:12:50,149 --> 01:12:51,844
Take the first flight out!

1046
01:13:15,574 --> 01:13:16,666
OK.

1047
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:20,003
So the Bloody Scoundrel,
operates from The Grand Pallazzo

1048
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:21,837
You will be staying there as well.

1049
01:13:22,047 --> 01:13:23,207
The story is,

1050
01:13:23,415 --> 01:13:25,474
you're the daughter of Himesh Bhai,

1051
01:13:25,584 --> 01:13:27,074
...the owner of King
Motels and Resorts, USA. - Me?

1052
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:28,445
lshika Patel...

1053
01:13:28,754 --> 01:13:29,846
American citizen...

1054
01:13:29,955 --> 01:13:32,753
Fake one... we aren't
really taking you to America.

1055
01:13:34,026 --> 01:13:35,220
This is their website.

1056
01:13:35,561 --> 01:13:37,893
Real website?
- No, we've made it.

1057
01:13:38,097 --> 01:13:39,962
Himesh Bhai fake, lshika fake,

1058
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:41,431
Kings Motel and Resorts fake...

1059
01:13:41,734 --> 01:13:44,703
But if you Google it, a
genuine-looking website will come up.

1060
01:13:45,104 --> 01:13:46,901
lmpressive homework!

1061
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:49,064
So Himesh Bhai... and family...

1062
01:13:49,408 --> 01:13:51,000
billionaire American citizens...

1063
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:55,507
Your father Himesh
Bhai is the US Motel King.

1064
01:13:56,048 --> 01:13:58,881
Owner of 240 motels and 60 resorts,

1065
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,664
You have three brothers, all older,

1066
01:14:16,969 --> 01:14:19,199
you're the only and
the youngest daughter.

1067
01:14:19,671 --> 01:14:23,437
You're in Goa to set
up your own business.

1068
01:14:28,247 --> 01:14:30,238
Welcome Ma'am.
- Thank you.

1069
01:14:39,158 --> 01:14:40,250

01:14:42,828 --> 01:14:43,920
Thank you Ma'am.

1072
01:14:44,029 --> 01:14:47,988
A man named Shankar works
here ... at the bell desk.

1073
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:49,158
Yes, Ma'am...

1074
01:14:49,468 --> 01:14:51,163
A friend of mine
stayed here last month

1075
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:52,794
and Shankar helped her a lot,

1076
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:54,765

1077
01:14:55,174 --> 01:14:56,266

1080
01:14:59,444 --> 01:15:01,207
lce, hash, sugar, grass?

1081
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:04,207
Shankar!

1082
01:15:04,283 --> 01:15:05,375
OK, Ma'am.

1083
01:15:06,051 --> 01:15:07,143
Thank you.

1084
01:15:17,496 --> 01:15:22,297
This is like a 2BHK flat.

1085
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:27,297
My feet hurt.

1086
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,206
The Alps...

1087
01:15:37,015 --> 01:15:38,107

1088
01:15:40,419 --> 01:15:43,013

Yes?
- Hello, Ma'am , l'm Shankar...

1092
01:16:03,876 --> 01:16:04,968

1093
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:06,770
Right.

1094
01:16:07,379 --> 01:16:08,641
Shankar
- Thank you Ma'am.

1095
01:16:08,714 --> 01:16:10,944
l need a list of all the
property dealers in Goa,

1096
01:16:11,516 --> 01:16:13,143
the best and most reliable.
- Yes Ma'am.

1097
01:16:13,418 --> 01:16:15,648
The ones who deal for
less than a crore rupees,

1098
01:16:16,221 --> 01:16:17,620
don't bother including them.

1099
01:16:18,056 --> 01:16:19,250
lt will be a waste of time.

1100
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,015
Will get it done...

1101
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:24,093

1102
01:16:24,196 --> 01:16:26,460

property you are looking for...

flat, bungalow, office, show room?

1104
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,425
For a restaurant. My restaurant.

1105
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,468
l need land for that.

1106
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,765

01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:38,071

1109
01:16:40,245 --> 01:16:42,145
Call me on my lndian
number once the list is ready.

1110
01:16:42,247 --> 01:16:43,373
OK, Ma'am
- OK?

1111
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:44,975
Now get to work.

1114
01:16:50,222 --> 01:16:51,382
You too...

1115
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,761
Boss... l found a huge fish.

1116
01:16:57,829 --> 01:16:58,921
lshika Patel.

1117
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,053
Excuse me one minute.

1118
01:17:30,162 --> 01:17:31,629
What're you doing?
l'm going to use this.

1119
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,958
One minute, l will not take long,

1120
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,431
l will not take long.
- OK... where's the manager?

1121
01:17:46,211 --> 01:17:47,974
He was checking
lshika's dad's website.

1122
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,006
He's hooked.

1123
01:17:50,882 --> 01:17:51,974
lshika...

1124
01:19:14,066 --> 01:19:15,431
Wohoo...
- Hello, Ma'am,

1125
01:19:15,534 --> 01:19:17,559
this is the property
dealer's list you asked for.

1126
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:19,068
Oh, you got them?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1127
01:19:19,304 --> 01:19:21,329
Superb...
- Ya, thank you. - Thank you, Shankar,

1128
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,340
My pleasure, Ma'am, and
this is your ride, Ma'am.

1129
01:19:23,408 --> 01:19:25,171
l like it.
- Ya - l love the colour. - Ya...

1130
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:26,570
Please Ma'am.
- Thank you.

1131
01:19:28,814 --> 01:19:30,213
Have a nice day, Ma'am.
- Thank you.

1132
01:21:05,043 --> 01:21:06,169
He's still not here...

1133
01:21:07,846 --> 01:21:09,177
where is he?

1134
01:21:09,748 --> 01:21:11,113
He's just been
watching for three days.

1135
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:12,983
Why isn't he attacking?

1136
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,180
Do you think he has
suspected something?

1137
01:21:37,576 --> 01:21:39,441
When will he stop looking so handsome?

1138
01:21:40,712 --> 01:21:42,737
All his luxury is
thanks to all our money.

1139
01:21:43,248 --> 01:21:46,342
Don't worry, won't last too long.

1140
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:03,264
Single malt... double.

1141
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,427
Sure Sir.

1142
01:22:13,078 --> 01:22:14,443
Yes
- Bill our drinks to this.

1143
01:22:14,779 --> 01:22:15,905
OK.

1144
01:22:34,132 --> 01:22:35,258
Jerks

1145
01:22:37,269 --> 01:22:38,634
Settle my tab please.

1146
01:22:38,737 --> 01:22:39,999
Sure Ma'am.
- Thank you.

1147
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:48,706
Ma'am, your card is blocked.
- What?

1148
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:53,144
How can it be blocked?

1149
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:57,077
Hello... yeah my card

1150
01:22:57,155 --> 01:23:02,923
number is 4541 9823 3318 0680.

1151
01:23:03,695 --> 01:23:05,322
How can it be blocked you block-head?!

1152
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:07,559

1153
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:09,192
Twenty four hours!

1154
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:12,465
What will l do without
my card for 24 hours?

1155
01:23:13,338 --> 01:23:16,239
You know l will sue
you for this... Raina!

1156
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:19,036
He is not even looking at me.

1157
01:23:19,611 --> 01:23:20,908
Drunkard's just chugging it down.

1158
01:23:22,514 --> 01:23:23,674
l am paying cash and leaving.

1159
01:23:24,716 --> 01:23:25,808
Okay Bye.

1160
01:23:27,652 --> 01:23:30,746
Hi, so l'm just going to pay
you by cash, how much was it?

1161
01:23:30,822 --> 01:23:32,915
lt's ok ma'am your bill has
been settled by your friend

1162
01:23:33,892 --> 01:23:34,984
Which friend?

1163
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:41,324
Excuse me!

1164
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:46,860
since when have you become my friend?

1165
01:23:48,506 --> 01:23:50,701
Since the white shirt and
blue jeans became your enemy.

1166
01:23:53,378 --> 01:23:54,936
Listen l don't have time for this...

1167
01:23:55,046 --> 01:23:56,479
So just tell me how
much you paid for my bill

1168
01:23:56,581 --> 01:23:58,981
Blue and white paid, not me.

1169
01:23:59,718 --> 01:24:01,242
Bartender said you...

1170
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:03,412
l pointed to the
blue and white's card,

1171
01:24:04,756 --> 01:24:06,747
the bartender was so hassled he didn't

1172
01:24:06,858 --> 01:24:07,984
notice whose card had l pointed to.

1173
01:24:08,493 --> 01:24:11,394
He presumed it was mine. Simple.

1174
01:24:13,398 --> 01:24:14,956
Very classy thief!

1175
01:24:15,533 --> 01:24:17,501
Classy! Thank you.

1176
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:19,762
Thief?

1177
01:24:21,005 --> 01:24:22,996
He misbehaved with you,
l punished him.

1178
01:24:23,108 --> 01:24:24,200
That's no theft

1179
01:24:24,743 --> 01:24:25,835
That is theft.

1180
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:27,775
Feeling guilty? Then apologise to him.

1181
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:31,843
But if you want to
thank me for punishing

1182
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:33,611
Him, then there's a
better bar in Colva.

1183
01:24:36,588 --> 01:24:41,651
Now l get it. l've known
guys to pay the bill and flirt,

1184
01:24:42,127 --> 01:24:44,391
but dude without paying!

1185
01:24:45,196 --> 01:24:46,322
Excellent.

1186
01:24:46,931 --> 01:24:49,297
But l am not in Goa to party

1187
01:24:49,467 --> 01:24:52,061
or see cheap tricks
from hunks like you.

1188
01:24:52,904 --> 01:24:53,996
Try it on someone else.

1189
01:24:57,475 --> 01:24:58,601
Excuse me
- Ya?

1190
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:00,007
Sorry but there's been some confusion,

1191
01:25:00,211 --> 01:25:03,908
can you pay the guy
whose card was used,

1192
01:25:03,982 --> 01:25:05,074
l think they're over there...

1193
01:25:10,088 --> 01:25:12,181
ls he is a ghost
that he just vanished?

1194
01:25:12,457 --> 01:25:14,652
lf she gives so much attitude,
he will vanish.

1195
01:25:14,726 --> 01:25:17,194
lt was a perfect plan lshika,
you ruined it.

1196
01:25:18,129 --> 01:25:20,927
He was convinced that you
are a damsel in distress.

1197
01:25:20,999 --> 01:25:22,990
Damsel in distress!

1198
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,828
No one gives a second
glance to damsels these days.

1199
01:25:27,505 --> 01:25:28,699
l can't play a damsel.

1200
01:25:28,907 --> 01:25:32,638
We've hired you! You have to
play according to our rules.

1201
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:37,306
Miss director, l am the one who
has to deal with him face to face.

1202
01:25:37,749 --> 01:25:40,047
You can't press a remote and have fun.

1203
01:25:41,586 --> 01:25:44,714
l am not an actress, l
have to play it my way.

1204
01:25:45,824 --> 01:25:47,485
What if he were to
catch me acting, then?

1205
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:55,624
The partnership idea has to
be sold to him, l'll sell it.

1206
01:25:56,267 --> 01:26:00,067
l've never let you go empty
handed from the mall, have l?

1207
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,732
Ok but now we have to
think of a new move.

1208
01:26:06,344 --> 01:26:09,507
Don't worry the next
move will be made by him.

1209
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:14,177
With hearty compliments
from Mr. Vikram Thapar.

1210
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:18,917
Vikram who?
- Mr. Thapar, Goa's beach king.

1211
01:26:19,357 --> 01:26:22,258
Out of all the water
sporting between Varca to Anjuna

1212
01:26:22,327 --> 01:26:23,919
at least a dozen are owned by him.

1213
01:26:24,295 --> 01:26:28,959
lncluding the one at our hotel.

1214
01:26:30,068 --> 01:26:32,161
You met him last night at the bar.

1215
01:26:33,705 --> 01:26:37,266
That's Vikram Thapar?

1216
01:26:37,342 --> 01:26:38,502
Yes ma'am.

1217
01:26:39,344 --> 01:26:41,835
lnteresting name.
- lnteresting man.

1218
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:47,950
lf you want to thank him, then
you can find him at the beach.

1219
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,421
Have a nice day ma'am.
- Thank you.

1220
01:26:55,226 --> 01:26:56,318
This is finished.

1221
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:59,088
How will we run the
business if he does this?

1222
01:26:59,731 --> 01:27:00,823
Tell him.

1223
01:27:13,411 --> 01:27:14,503
Grease.

1224
01:27:18,116 --> 01:27:22,314
Mr. Beach King, credit card trick
didn't work so you sent flowers?

1225
01:27:23,555 --> 01:27:25,887
They always work... here you are

1226
01:27:26,758 --> 01:27:27,850
So l was right.

1227
01:27:28,259 --> 01:27:30,659
Last night's drama was to attract me.

1228
01:27:31,062 --> 01:27:32,791
You are so attractive what could l do?

1229
01:27:34,899 --> 01:27:36,025
Thank you...

1230
01:27:36,568 --> 01:27:37,660
for the flowers.

1231
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:41,300
ls it from your own
money or stolen cash?

1232
01:27:43,141 --> 01:27:44,233
Did they smell nice?

1233
01:27:44,943 --> 01:27:46,137
So how does it matter then?

1234
01:27:50,315 --> 01:27:51,407
l want to go for a ride.

1235
01:27:51,482 --> 01:27:53,347
Come, l will take you
- l will drive.

1236
01:28:09,133 --> 01:28:11,397
lf you are not here to party
then what're you doing here?

1237
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,835
To prove that l can
also set up a business.

1238
01:28:15,506 --> 01:28:17,736
Prove to whom?
- To my Father.

1239
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:22,145
l told him l wanted to set up a
chain of restaurants in lndia,

1240
01:28:22,347 --> 01:28:23,609
he thought it was stupid.

1241
01:28:24,182 --> 01:28:26,480
Do anything in the U.S.
but not in lndia.

1242
01:28:26,985 --> 01:28:29,453
After numerous fights
he has conceded that

1243
01:28:29,854 --> 01:28:34,951
l first set up the project
like land, licences, clearances,

1244
01:28:35,193 --> 01:28:38,822
staff everything, and then
he'll invest five million.

1245
01:28:40,164 --> 01:28:42,758
Five million dollars is...
- Twenty five crores

1246
01:28:43,668 --> 01:28:44,794
Right.

1247
01:28:46,104 --> 01:28:47,969
But do you know how much
he's given me for my trip?

1248
01:28:48,973 --> 01:28:53,603
Five lakhs including transport,
hotel food.

1249
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:55,571
But l'll prove it.

1250
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,341
l won't leave here till
my restaurant is set up,

1251
01:28:57,649 --> 01:29:00,447
even if it means
sleeping on the beaches.

1252
01:29:05,556 --> 01:29:07,524
l can help you set up your restaurant.

1253
01:29:07,959 --> 01:29:09,051
Really?

1254
01:29:10,061 --> 01:29:11,187
But why?

1255
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:18,293
Oh lone girl, millionaire dad,

1256
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:21,036
trap her, take her money.

1257
01:29:21,739 --> 01:29:22,865
ls this the plan?

1258
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:27,433
Right! This was my plan.

1259
01:29:27,879 --> 01:29:28,971
But you're so clever,

1260
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:31,339
you don't need any help.

1261
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:33,549
Goa is waiting for you.

1262
01:29:33,651 --> 01:29:37,314
All the honest officers, land owners,
cops, collector, ministers.

1263
01:29:38,256 --> 01:29:41,248
They will help you honestly.

1264
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,652
You have a good evening

1265
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,124
Hey... Mr. Beach King!

1266
01:29:51,002 --> 01:29:52,196
Want to have a beer?

1267
01:30:01,579 --> 01:30:03,342
l don't want any favours.

1268
01:30:04,782 --> 01:30:07,046
Do you want an equal
partnership of sharing,

1269
01:30:07,251 --> 01:30:09,446
But profit sharing will be 60-40

1270
01:30:10,855 --> 01:30:12,516
You said equal partnership?

1271
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:15,358
My idea, so 60 mine. Agreed?

1272
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:17,192
Okay agreed.

1273
01:30:18,563 --> 01:30:20,690
You will also have to
invest in the partnership.

1274
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:23,692
Oh.

1275
01:30:25,436 --> 01:30:26,528
Obviously.

1276
01:30:27,171 --> 01:30:29,036
Why do you think l am
letting you be my partner?

1277
01:30:30,942 --> 01:30:34,002
l'm not going to run
away with your money,

1278
01:30:34,645 --> 01:30:37,205
all the expenses will be
transparent and for the yacht party.

1279
01:30:37,882 --> 01:30:39,008
Yacht party?

1280
01:30:40,485 --> 01:30:41,577
See

1281
01:30:42,286 --> 01:30:43,810
whenever l go to meet somebody...

1282
01:30:44,422 --> 01:30:45,582
they don't take me seriously.

1283
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:50,016
lf we organise a yacht party,

1284
01:30:50,495 --> 01:30:53,293
good food, music, wine,

1285
01:30:53,698 --> 01:30:57,429
invite all the important people
in Goa, put photos in the press.

1286
01:30:57,902 --> 01:31:00,200
Just see, the phone
won't stop ringing.

1287
01:31:00,438 --> 01:31:02,998
Entire Goa will help our restaurant.

1288
01:31:04,408 --> 01:31:06,273
That's how we promote in the states.

1289
01:31:09,046 --> 01:31:11,810
Had l the money, l
would've had the party,

1290
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:14,073
and started the restaurant by now.

1291
01:31:16,087 --> 01:31:17,213
How much will we need for the party?

1292
01:31:19,090 --> 01:31:21,456
A crore perhaps.

1293
01:31:26,164 --> 01:31:28,257
As soon as dad
sanctions his 25 crores,

1294
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:30,293
your money will be returned.

1295
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:35,437
So partner or no partner?

1296
01:31:43,781 --> 01:31:44,907
Partner.

1297
01:32:17,882 --> 01:32:19,008
How much for this?

1298
01:32:19,116 --> 01:32:20,276
One can get shoes for 500 rupees here.

1299
01:32:20,585 --> 01:32:21,449
And that one?

1300
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:44,801
Which brand?

1301
01:32:44,876 --> 01:32:46,901
Mango, Diesel ,
Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci,

1302
01:32:53,084 --> 01:32:54,176
What time is it?

1303
01:32:54,619 --> 01:32:55,745
Tripping on these Jalapenos

1304
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,014
We have to leave now,
come on, come on, come on...

1305
01:32:57,121 --> 01:32:59,055
l'm not done eating...
- We have to leave, he is not going to

1306
01:32:59,123 --> 01:33:00,215
Wait for us all day.

1307
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:01,450
What's the rush, is
it an American thing?

1308
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,126
What happened?
- You have got to be kidding me man...

1309
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,094
What're you doing?

1310
01:33:12,203 --> 01:33:14,296
Watch out, watch out. What the hell?

1311
01:33:45,002 --> 01:33:46,128
No price tag?

1312
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:47,528
We'll put it when we get there.

1313
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,334
Ya Gaurav? On our way.

1314
01:33:58,816 --> 01:34:01,046
Hey Gaurav what's up?
- You are looking nice.

1315
01:34:01,118 --> 01:34:02,278
Come, come, come.

1316
01:34:02,687 --> 01:34:04,177
Ok... that's Saira
- Hello

1317
01:34:04,255 --> 01:34:05,483
This is Dimple.
- Hi - Hello

1318
01:34:05,823 --> 01:34:07,313
Ladies on a mission huh? Come...

1319
01:34:27,345 --> 01:34:29,279
Like a fool l rushed here,

1320
01:34:30,147 --> 01:34:31,671
didn't even pack properly.

1321
01:34:31,782 --> 01:34:33,750
All the money is
going to the hotel bill.

1322
01:34:36,187 --> 01:34:39,418
l think l should shift from
Pallazzo to a cheaper one star hotel.

1323
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:43,692
From the money l save, l
can buy a dress at least.

1324
01:34:44,195 --> 01:34:45,662
You won't be able to handle a one star

1325
01:34:46,364 --> 01:34:47,661
So what to do?

1326
01:34:48,366 --> 01:34:50,596
l don't have a dress for the party.

1327
01:34:53,304 --> 01:34:54,396
Let's go shopping!

1328
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:56,866
How sweet...

1329
01:35:02,847 --> 01:35:05,839
This is what they are
wearing in New York now, like now.

1330
01:35:06,517 --> 01:35:08,178
lt's lovely.
- Prada!

1331
01:35:08,419 --> 01:35:09,818
Beautiful.

1332
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:11,481
Ninety thousand only.

1333
01:35:11,756 --> 01:35:12,882
Only!

1334
01:35:15,326 --> 01:35:16,623
One dress is not good enough,

1335
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:18,986
l mean atleast...

1336
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,455
l need at least eight,

1337
01:35:23,401 --> 01:35:27,132
matching foot wear,
jewellery, accessories.

1338
01:35:27,204 --> 01:35:28,432
Take everything.

1339
01:35:29,206 --> 01:35:31,003
lt's an investment for our future.

1340
01:35:31,108 --> 01:35:33,269
l mean business future.

1341
01:35:40,551 --> 01:35:41,813
And its backless.

1342
01:35:43,754 --> 01:35:44,812
lts good.

1343
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:49,918
Now thats nice.

1344
01:35:51,862 --> 01:35:52,988
lts nice.

1345
01:36:08,112 --> 01:36:09,204
Nice couple.

1346
01:36:10,081 --> 01:36:11,548
But the boy is short.

1347
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:13,610
Why don't you get heels?

1348
01:36:16,587 --> 01:36:18,282
l can't believe we
have shopped so much.

1349
01:36:32,970 --> 01:36:35,336
Sixteen lakhs fifty thousand.

1350
01:36:35,406 --> 01:36:37,340
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1351
01:36:38,676 --> 01:36:39,802
Mind blowing.

1352
01:36:40,411 --> 01:36:41,605
Thank you.

1353
01:36:43,414 --> 01:36:44,608
Ohh my God...

1354
01:36:47,017 --> 01:36:48,678
Okay okay enough hugging kissing...

1355
01:36:48,786 --> 01:36:50,048
Let's get to work.

1356
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,746
Phase two!

1357
01:36:53,858 --> 01:36:54,916
Can you talk lshika?

1358
01:36:55,793 --> 01:36:58,819
Listen yachts are
parked at the Madovi Jetty.

1359
01:36:59,130 --> 01:37:01,098
One of them is my
friend Fardeen's Yacht.

1360
01:37:01,866 --> 01:37:03,800
He has explained
everything to the captain.

1361
01:37:03,868 --> 01:37:04,926
He is all set.

1362
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,094
He will ask you for the
entire payment in advance.

1363
01:37:07,805 --> 01:37:09,534
Then you take over.

1364
01:37:10,407 --> 01:37:12,807
The yacht is Brown
in colour and called

1365
01:37:13,144 --> 01:37:15,806
Freedom. Freedom it is!

1366
01:37:16,814 --> 01:37:17,872
So?

1367
01:37:17,948 --> 01:37:19,210
lncluding food and beverages,

1368
01:37:19,283 --> 01:37:21,547
and 6pm to midnight
will be 20 lakhs in total.

1369
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:24,979
Too much no?

1370
01:37:25,322 --> 01:37:26,812
That's 40,000 dollars.

1371
01:37:27,191 --> 01:37:30,922
ln the US this party will
cost at least a 100,000 dollars.

1372
01:37:31,061 --> 01:37:32,824
Actually it's a good deal.

1373
01:37:33,831 --> 01:37:35,856
Aye aye captain sail the boat.

1374
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,969
Full advance payment in cash,
then booking, then sailing.

1375
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:46,334
Done.

1376
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:57,078
How much is this?

1377
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:18,933
lnvitation card

1378
01:38:25,216 --> 01:38:27,446
Oh. Gorgeous.

1379
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,177
Here you go.

1380
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,558
Ninety rupees

1381
01:38:46,370 --> 01:38:47,462
ls this the cheapest?

1382
01:38:47,571 --> 01:38:49,436
Only mango juice will
be cheaper than this.

1383
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:50,902
Forty bottles please.

1384
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:53,968
How much?

1385
01:38:54,044 --> 01:38:55,102
20 and 50

1386
01:38:55,913 --> 01:38:56,971
l'll take all

1387
01:39:06,590 --> 01:39:10,082
A 200 bucks bottle
is now worth 90,000.

1388
01:39:32,082 --> 01:39:33,140
Thank you

1389
01:40:15,559 --> 01:40:18,289
So far we've earned 45 lakhs.

1390
01:40:18,595 --> 01:40:23,430
After lshika's fee and all expenses,
we are left with 35.

1391
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,127
lshika Patel you are a genius.

1392
01:40:54,031 --> 01:40:55,692
There are at least 8 investors.

1393
01:40:55,766 --> 01:40:57,757
ln fact we might not need
your dad's money anymore.

1394
01:40:58,769 --> 01:41:01,431
No. l don't need anymore partners.

1395
01:41:01,705 --> 01:41:05,038
l am happy with one,
whom l can trust completely.

1396
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:10,339
No really, for any
business trust is crucial.

1397
01:41:12,716 --> 01:41:13,774
Right,

1398
01:41:15,252 --> 01:41:16,583
trust is crucial.

1399
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:22,785
Oh my god! Vikram.

1400
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:34,069
Once more, once more.

1401
01:41:39,076 --> 01:41:41,067
We never had any in our childhood

1402
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:43,112
so l go crazy when l see them now.

1403
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:46,076
Papa got us 1 of each firework and,

1404
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:47,717
they would be finished in seconds.

1405
01:41:47,818 --> 01:41:49,683
l would be angry with the
fireworks when they finished so soon,

1406
01:41:49,753 --> 01:41:50,811
wondering , why have they finished?

1407
01:41:51,722 --> 01:41:53,189
But why rationing on the fireworks?

1408
01:41:53,424 --> 01:41:55,824
Your father could've
bought an entire factory right?

1409
01:42:01,498 --> 01:42:05,093
Had my father not rationed in
the beginning of his business,

1410
01:42:05,436 --> 01:42:07,461
then how would he have
become the Motel King?

1411
01:42:10,107 --> 01:42:11,768
Let's go.

1412
01:42:12,109 --> 01:42:13,167
Let's go party

1413
01:42:15,779 --> 01:42:17,110
Haven't we just been to a party?

1414
01:42:17,514 --> 01:42:18,640
That wasn't a party, it was business.

1415
01:42:20,284 --> 01:42:21,342
lsn't it late?

1416
01:42:21,785 --> 01:42:23,218
ls someone waiting for you?

1417
01:42:28,125 --> 01:42:30,491
Alright Vikram Thapar let's party.

1418
01:42:30,727 --> 01:42:31,785
Let's party.

1419
01:42:42,873 --> 01:42:44,135
She isn't answering.

1420
01:42:45,542 --> 01:42:47,237
Booking was till 12.

1421
01:42:48,212 --> 01:42:49,679
Party must have
finished long time ago.

1422
01:42:50,747 --> 01:42:53,511
Real romance has happened
between the calf and the butcher.

1423
01:42:54,418 --> 01:42:56,147
Real romance.

1424
01:42:56,620 --> 01:43:00,784
Raina, if what she is
saying is true, then?

1425
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:05,319
Then my dear,

1426
01:43:07,164 --> 01:43:08,597
we are screwed.

1427
01:48:56,179 --> 01:48:58,147
All night party!

1428
01:48:58,548 --> 01:49:00,175
While we've been
rotting in that hell-hole,

1429
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:01,877
she is living it up in the 5 star.

1430
01:49:01,985 --> 01:49:03,612
Partying with Sunny all night.

1431
01:49:04,254 --> 01:49:06,245
l had to go with him
to build his confidence.

1432
01:49:06,656 --> 01:49:09,147
What other debaucheries did
you do to build his confidence?

1433
01:49:09,259 --> 01:49:11,056
Raina, please tell her to shut up.

1434
01:49:11,161 --> 01:49:12,219
l am not going to shut up.

1435
01:49:13,096 --> 01:49:14,529
You are in Goa for us.

1436
01:49:14,598 --> 01:49:15,690
We've hired you.

1437
01:49:15,765 --> 01:49:16,857
We are footing the bills.

1438
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:20,164
Not for you to hang out with my
ex-boyfriend like shameless bitch.

1439
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:21,567
That's enough Dimple.

1440
01:49:22,572 --> 01:49:24,164
You are always taking her side.

1441
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:26,202
Dimple, just shut up.

1442
01:49:35,552 --> 01:49:38,180
Do you have any idea how
worried we've been all night?

1443
01:49:39,155 --> 01:49:40,213
Any idea?

1444
01:49:46,563 --> 01:49:47,621
l am really sorry.

1445
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:52,291
Champagne, beer, yacht,

1446
01:49:53,904 --> 01:49:55,303
brain got a bit side tracked.

1447
01:49:57,574 --> 01:49:59,064
l promise it won't happen again.

1448
01:50:02,012 --> 01:50:03,138
l am on your side.

1449
01:50:04,581 --> 01:50:07,573
Now the focus is to
defeat the Bloody Scoundrel.

1450
01:50:08,084 --> 01:50:09,312
Down with the Bloody Scoundrel.

1451
01:50:09,819 --> 01:50:11,252
We haven't even
recovered half the amount yet.

1452
01:50:12,622 --> 01:50:13,953
We've a long way to go.

1453
01:50:14,958 --> 01:50:16,220
Don't ditch lshika.

1454
01:50:17,594 --> 01:50:18,652
l won't.

1455
01:50:22,265 --> 01:50:23,857
Dimple, come on.

1456
01:51:20,657 --> 01:51:22,284
Hi, you haven't slept?

1457
01:51:22,392 --> 01:51:24,189
l want to show you
something mind blowing.

1458
01:51:24,828 --> 01:51:25,886
OK, let's go

1459
01:51:31,668 --> 01:51:34,034
l know, even my mind
is completely blown.

1460
01:51:35,672 --> 01:51:36,730
Wow!!

1461
01:51:37,907 --> 01:51:39,966
This land is perfect
for the restaurant.

1462
01:51:43,346 --> 01:51:44,404
Very nice.

1463
01:51:46,416 --> 01:51:47,713
Actually it's perfect.

1464
01:51:50,754 --> 01:51:51,812
Let's make it here.

1465
01:51:52,255 --> 01:51:53,688
Let's talk to the owner.

1466
01:51:53,757 --> 01:51:54,815
Wait, wait, wait partner.

1467
01:51:57,427 --> 01:51:59,952
Before we go ahead l
want to share a few secrets,

1468
01:52:00,697 --> 01:52:03,791
after knowing them you might
want to break the partnership.

1469
01:52:06,703 --> 01:52:07,829
What secret can that be?

1470
01:52:09,706 --> 01:52:11,173
l'm not breaking the partnership.

1471
01:52:12,442 --> 01:52:14,740
You will also have to
tell me your secrets.

1472
01:52:21,918 --> 01:52:23,385
l don't have any secrets.

1473
01:52:24,454 --> 01:52:26,012
You can tell me yours.
- l am a conman.

1474
01:52:31,394 --> 01:52:32,452
l am a thief.

1475
01:52:36,299 --> 01:52:39,735
For the last 15 years,
l've conned 30 ladies.

1476
01:52:40,737 --> 01:52:41,795
You are the 31st.

1477
01:52:45,241 --> 01:52:46,731
Friendship, partnership...

1478
01:52:46,810 --> 01:52:49,779
...investment in your
project has all been for this.

1479
01:52:51,915 --> 01:52:53,940
My plan was to run
away after fleecing you,

1480
01:52:59,789 --> 01:53:01,222
but l fell in love with you lshika.

1481
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:06,253
l am not lying.

1482
01:53:09,232 --> 01:53:10,290
l have lied a lot.

1483
01:53:14,838 --> 01:53:16,499
l've spent my entire life alone,

1484
01:53:19,242 --> 01:53:21,369
even if l wanted to be
friends with someone,

1485
01:53:21,444 --> 01:53:23,105
l would scold myself and restrain,

1486
01:53:23,179 --> 01:53:25,204
but since l met my
heart won't listen to me.

1487
01:53:32,455 --> 01:53:33,513
Do you...

1488
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:38,218
love me?

1489
01:53:42,432 --> 01:53:43,797
Will you marry me lshika?

1490
01:53:47,403 --> 01:53:48,529
He proposed to you?

1491
01:53:50,206 --> 01:53:52,197
Liar. Look at her face.

1492
01:53:52,375 --> 01:53:54,536
He never proposed to me,
why would he propose to her?

1493
01:53:55,145 --> 01:53:56,544
lt's not a proposal,

1494
01:53:58,248 --> 01:53:59,306
it's a con silly.

1495
01:53:59,816 --> 01:54:01,807
The biggest con of his life.

1496
01:54:02,552 --> 01:54:05,020
After marrying her he
will have her, her father's,

1497
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:08,251
the land's, the
restaurant's money in his pocket.

1498
01:54:08,558 --> 01:54:10,150
With an investment of 40 lakhs,

1499
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:12,820
he plans to hit the
billion dollarjackpot.

1500
01:54:15,398 --> 01:54:16,456
That's why l was wondering

1501
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:21,133
why is he buying her all
these dresses and shoes for?

1502
01:54:21,971 --> 01:54:23,563
He will marry for money.

1503
01:54:28,511 --> 01:54:29,569
Marry him.

1504
01:54:30,246 --> 01:54:31,577
No way. Are you crazy?

1505
01:54:31,848 --> 01:54:34,146
This is the best way to
get the rest of our money.

1506
01:54:35,351 --> 01:54:36,409
How?

1507
01:54:36,519 --> 01:54:37,850
Her father won't marry her...

1508
01:54:37,921 --> 01:54:43,860
...off to a thief like Vikram
Thapar without any security right?

1509
01:54:44,527 --> 01:54:48,588
And for that security lshika's
father will ask him to buy that land

1510
01:54:48,932 --> 01:54:49,990
in her name.

1511
01:54:50,333 --> 01:54:51,595
Before the wedding.

1512
01:54:51,868 --> 01:54:53,495
So will she get married to Sunny?

1513
01:54:54,270 --> 01:54:56,602
No, the plot will be
bought before the wedding.

1514
01:54:56,873 --> 01:54:59,171
We'll sell it
immediately after its registration.

1515
01:54:59,909 --> 01:55:03,606
Take our money, and get
on the first flight home.

1516
01:55:04,247 --> 01:55:05,612
Not bad Saira.

1517
01:55:05,882 --> 01:55:07,247
Can you clear one matter first,

1518
01:55:07,383 --> 01:55:09,442
will she or wont she
be married to Sunny?

1519
01:55:09,552 --> 01:55:10,610
No.

1520
01:55:12,155 --> 01:55:14,419
lshika will only accept his proposal.

1521
01:55:15,892 --> 01:55:17,382
Make him speak to her father.

1522
01:55:20,463 --> 01:55:22,931
Right we have to find a papa for her.

1523
01:55:24,634 --> 01:55:26,363
Let me figure this out.

1524
01:55:29,906 --> 01:55:30,964
l'll make tea.

1525
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:32,098
l'll leave.

1526
01:55:32,242 --> 01:55:34,267
No, let Raina finish her call.

1527
01:55:37,513 --> 01:55:38,571
Did he give you flowers?

1528
01:55:41,317 --> 01:55:42,375
What?

1529
01:55:42,485 --> 01:55:45,283
When he proposed. Ring?

1530
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,248
No

1531
01:55:48,591 --> 01:55:49,649
Plain?

1532
01:55:52,528 --> 01:55:53,586
Kiss?

1533
01:55:55,131 --> 01:55:56,928
You guys must have definitely kissed.

1534
01:55:58,201 --> 01:56:00,931
l am conning him,
and he is conning me.

1535
01:56:03,072 --> 01:56:04,130
Where did the kiss come from?

1536
01:56:04,607 --> 01:56:07,474
Kiss is a bitch. lt
creeps up anywhere.

1537
01:56:07,677 --> 01:56:10,077
Ok papa sorted.

1538
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:15,379
lshika tell him l do, l do, l do.

1539
01:56:15,952 --> 01:56:18,386
Before that, let's find
out the value of the land.

1540
01:56:19,956 --> 01:56:21,287
lt's a fair deal ma'am,

1541
01:56:21,491 --> 01:56:22,549
don't worry.

1542
01:56:22,692 --> 01:56:23,954
Owner is settled in Dubai,

1543
01:56:24,193 --> 01:56:26,058
l have the Power of Attorney.

1544
01:56:26,195 --> 01:56:28,060
l'll do the formalities.

1545
01:56:28,698 --> 01:56:31,565
Final price 90 Lakhs.

1546
01:56:31,968 --> 01:56:34,163
No bargaining. Sorry.

1547
01:56:37,307 --> 01:56:38,365
Ninety Lakhs.

1548
01:56:39,709 --> 01:56:41,108
My gosh!
- Yes, yes.

1549
01:56:41,644 --> 01:56:42,702
Really?

1550
01:56:43,012 --> 01:56:44,070
Mind-blowing!

1551
01:56:45,381 --> 01:56:46,439
Papa call time!

1552
01:56:53,089 --> 01:56:54,147
Papa.

1553
01:57:00,563 --> 01:57:01,621
Hello Mr. Patel.

1554
01:57:01,998 --> 01:57:03,056
Vikram Thapar?

1555
01:57:03,132 --> 01:57:04,190
Yes sir, Vikram Thapar.

1556
01:57:04,334 --> 01:57:05,665
Let's come straight to the point...

1557
01:57:06,002 --> 01:57:08,994
What's the turnover of
your water sports business?

1558
01:57:09,505 --> 01:57:11,166
Not even 50 Lakhs annually.

1559
01:57:11,441 --> 01:57:14,308
lshika's shoes almost cost that much!

1560
01:57:14,410 --> 01:57:18,005
Sir, honestly l don't
have your kind of money,

1561
01:57:20,350 --> 01:57:23,376
but lshika's happiness
is most important to me.

1562
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:27,555
l promise to always keep her happy.

1563
01:57:29,559 --> 01:57:32,119
My dear a promise has no value.

1564
01:57:32,295 --> 01:57:34,286
My dear a promise has no value...

1565
01:57:35,031 --> 01:57:36,396
bills cannot be paid by promises.

1566
01:57:37,367 --> 01:57:40,768
Moreover, how do l know you are not
marrying my daughter for her money?

1567
01:57:41,237 --> 01:57:42,295
Tell me.

1568
01:57:45,708 --> 01:57:48,302
Sir, l love lshika not her money.

1569
01:57:49,312 --> 01:57:51,041
l can't just believe what you say.

1570
01:57:51,447 --> 01:57:53,039
Trust needs proof.

1571
01:57:53,383 --> 01:57:55,112
lf you want to marry lshika,

1572
01:57:55,184 --> 01:57:59,484
then buy a land of her
choice registered in her name

1573
01:57:59,589 --> 01:58:01,079
for her restaurant.

1574
01:58:02,058 --> 01:58:04,219
l'll make the rest of the
investment in the restaurant,

1575
01:58:05,061 --> 01:58:06,119
but if you buy the land

1576
01:58:06,195 --> 01:58:07,321
then l'll be rest assured
that she has some security.

1577
01:58:08,131 --> 01:58:09,530
That's my condition.

1578
01:58:20,309 --> 01:58:23,176
What happened? Can't
give the security?

1579
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:31,809
l'll give sir, off course l will.

1580
01:58:34,323 --> 01:58:35,722
For lshika l'll do anything...

1581
01:58:42,765 --> 01:58:44,357
The butcher becomes the calf.

1582
01:58:45,735 --> 01:58:48,260
l am telling you, the
scoundrel is in love.

1583
01:58:48,604 --> 01:58:50,128
He can't love anyone.

1584
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:52,603
He is laying his trap
slowly and steadily.

1585
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:55,100
He is getting caught up in it.

1586
01:59:02,518 --> 01:59:03,576
l am trapped.

1587
01:59:06,255 --> 01:59:09,156
l've made a promise but
l don't have 90 Lakhs.

1588
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:13,522
l have only 45 left
after the yacht party.

1589
01:59:15,331 --> 01:59:16,389
So now?

1590
01:59:19,502 --> 01:59:22,665
Had l not met you, l could
have conned someone for it easily.

1591
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:24,433
But now l can't do it.

1592
01:59:26,275 --> 01:59:27,333
l love you...

1593
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:31,740
but how will l give your
father security? l don't know!

1594
01:59:36,152 --> 01:59:38,177
We will have to give
the rest of the 45 Lakhs.

1595
01:59:39,155 --> 01:59:41,419
Crazy? We've got it
with so much difficulty.

1596
01:59:41,624 --> 01:59:45,526
With our 45 and his 45,
he will buy the plot.

1597
01:59:46,229 --> 01:59:48,663
Hopefully when we sell it
we will get more than 90,

1598
01:59:48,764 --> 01:59:50,698
and we'll recover all our money.

1599
01:59:54,537 --> 01:59:59,474
Okay lshika, tell him you
raised 45 by selling yourjewellery.

1600
02:00:00,176 --> 02:00:01,234
Okay?

1601
02:00:03,646 --> 02:00:04,704
But Raina,

1602
02:00:06,916 --> 02:00:08,816
what if he has genuinely
fallen in love with me, then?

1603
02:00:12,722 --> 02:00:13,780
what's going on here?

1604
02:00:13,890 --> 02:00:15,482
Love what else?

1605
02:00:15,658 --> 02:00:17,558
l told you she's a traitor.

1606
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:20,652
He is leading you on.
He can't love anyone.

1607
02:00:20,763 --> 02:00:21,821
He loves me... perhaps.

1608
02:00:22,565 --> 02:00:25,295
lshika waved the magic wand

1609
02:00:25,401 --> 02:00:28,199
and the scoundrel became
a caring, honest lover.

1610
02:00:28,304 --> 02:00:30,568
Believe me he has changed.

1611
02:00:30,940 --> 02:00:33,465
lf you look into his eyes,
you will see an honest man.

1612
02:00:33,543 --> 02:00:34,942
Enough lshika.

1613
02:00:35,211 --> 02:00:36,508
Even l've seen his eyes,

1614
02:00:36,879 --> 02:00:38,210
when he spoke to my
father-in-law about his poor mother...

1615
02:00:38,281 --> 02:00:40,579
...and sister and stole our 10 Lakhs.

1616
02:00:40,883 --> 02:00:43,215
lf you don't want to
carry on, it's ok.

1617
02:00:43,786 --> 02:00:47,381
But don't mock us. We're
stupid and you're clever.

1618
02:00:48,524 --> 02:00:50,515
When he vanishes after
breaking your heart,

1619
02:00:50,626 --> 02:00:51,957
that's when you will realise her pain

1620
02:00:52,328 --> 02:00:55,764
and know that we are your
well-wishers, not that rogue.

1621
02:01:09,712 --> 02:01:10,770
Raina...

1622
02:01:11,347 --> 02:01:12,405
the money for Vikram.

1623
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:14,540
Are we crazy to hand over so
much money to a thief's girlfriend?

1624
02:01:14,650 --> 02:01:17,915
You will run away with it.
Aren't you in love with him?

1625
02:01:17,987 --> 02:01:19,249
l am.

1626
02:01:21,724 --> 02:01:22,782
l am in love with him.

1627
02:01:27,263 --> 02:01:29,697
But l'm an honest
sales girl, not a thief.

1628
02:01:30,466 --> 02:01:32,263
Less salary, tough life,

1629
02:01:33,869 --> 02:01:39,273
but l feel proud when my
bosses praise me for my honesty.

1630
02:01:41,344 --> 02:01:45,371
l wouldn't sell that
feeling even for a crore.

1631
02:01:47,917 --> 02:01:49,475
l won't cheat you.

1632
02:01:51,754 --> 02:01:52,812
Trust me.

1633
02:02:26,322 --> 02:02:27,789
l'll return all your money.

1634
02:02:28,624 --> 02:02:32,560
Promise me, no more lies.

1635
02:02:45,641 --> 02:02:46,699
l love you.

1636
02:02:48,878 --> 02:02:49,936
l love you.

1637
02:02:53,416 --> 02:02:54,474
Owner?

1638
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:55,983
Mr. Abhay Salaskar.

1639
02:02:56,686 --> 02:02:57,983
He is settled in Dubai.

1640
02:02:58,354 --> 02:03:00,379
Power of Attorney is with me D'Silva.

1641
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:04,417
Buyer?

1642
02:03:05,761 --> 02:03:06,819
lshika Patel.

1643
02:03:08,431 --> 02:03:09,489
Sign please.

1644
02:03:16,005 --> 02:03:17,063
Ma'am sign here please.

1645
02:03:54,076 --> 02:03:56,135
Hundred percent genuine!

1646
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:06,579
lshika

1647
02:04:08,424 --> 02:04:10,153
Sorry, and Thank you.

1648
02:04:10,726 --> 02:04:11,750
lt's okay.

1649
02:04:20,102 --> 02:04:22,434
Sorry. Thank you.

1650
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:26,169
l can't wait to see his face

1651
02:04:26,442 --> 02:04:29,969
when he sees us and
realises that he has been duped.

1652
02:04:30,112 --> 02:04:31,443
But where is the scoundrel?

1653
02:04:51,467 --> 02:04:55,198
This is fine. - Hello, hello
excuse me, what are you doing here?

1654
02:04:55,905 --> 02:04:56,963
Flood control.

1655
02:04:58,073 --> 02:04:59,131
Where's the flood?

1656
02:04:59,475 --> 02:05:01,466
lt's not here now, but it
will come after the monsoons.

1657
02:05:01,544 --> 02:05:02,602
Who gave you permission?

1658
02:05:02,978 --> 02:05:04,570
We are the new owners of this land.

1659
02:05:04,780 --> 02:05:05,940
Take our permission.

1660
02:05:06,048 --> 02:05:08,608
You? lsn't the owner Abhay Salaskar?

1661
02:05:08,717 --> 02:05:11,777
Was. He is in Dubai now. We bought it.

1662
02:05:12,021 --> 02:05:13,079
For 90 lakhs.

1663
02:05:14,490 --> 02:05:16,515
90! Lakhs!
- Cheap deal isn't it?

1664
02:05:17,159 --> 02:05:18,854
What would be its market value now?

1665
02:05:20,162 --> 02:05:21,220
3 Lakhs

1666
02:05:21,897 --> 02:05:23,228
with great difficulty.

1667
02:05:24,166 --> 02:05:28,660
This is a swamp. lt's under
water for 5 months. What value?

1668
02:05:30,873 --> 02:05:35,105
Check the deed, may be there
is an extra zero by mistake.

1669
02:05:35,678 --> 02:05:37,805
Even 9 Lakhs is too much.

1670
02:05:37,913 --> 02:05:40,711
David, Abhay
Salaskar has cheated them.

1671
02:05:41,183 --> 02:05:42,241
Ninety Lakhs.

1672
02:05:53,729 --> 02:05:55,162
What's your cut?

1673
02:06:00,102 --> 02:06:01,160
What?

1674
02:06:01,270 --> 02:06:03,568
How much will that
scoundrel give you out of the 90?

1675
02:06:04,206 --> 02:06:06,140
ls it a 50-50 or a 60-40 partnership?

1676
02:06:06,709 --> 02:06:10,270
Was it his idea because an idea
is worth more, or was it yours?

1677
02:06:10,546 --> 02:06:12,275
Shut up Raina.
- You double crossing bitch.

1678
02:06:12,548 --> 02:06:14,743
Shut up Raina.
- Liar, thief, bloody scoundrel.

1679
02:06:14,817 --> 02:06:15,875
Raina, shut up!

1680
02:06:15,985 --> 02:06:17,543
lshika...
- Shut up all of you...

1681
02:06:23,993 --> 02:06:25,153
l did it for you

1682
02:06:27,563 --> 02:06:28,757
and you are accusing me?

1683
02:06:30,566 --> 02:06:31,624
Calling me a thief?

1684
02:06:34,837 --> 02:06:35,895
To hell with you.

1685
02:06:40,709 --> 02:06:41,767
Raina!

1686
02:06:41,977 --> 02:06:44,172
Had lshika cheated us,
then why would she come here?

1687
02:06:45,014 --> 02:06:46,845
Don't abuse her for your defeat.

1688
02:06:47,216 --> 02:06:48,945
The scoundrel has cheated her as well.

1689
02:07:14,610 --> 02:07:17,602
First, he bought the
land himself, for 3 Lakhs

1690
02:07:17,947 --> 02:07:19,881
as Abhay Salaskar from Dubai.

1691
02:07:20,349 --> 02:07:23,147
Then he gave the Power
of Attorney to D'Silva.

1692
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:26,053
lshika met D'Silva

1693
02:07:26,722 --> 02:07:28,622
who quoted 90 lakhs.

1694
02:07:29,758 --> 02:07:31,623
Out of which we gave 45 Lakhs.

1695
02:07:33,295 --> 02:07:34,626
After signing the deed

1696
02:07:35,097 --> 02:07:37,827
D'Silva gave the entire
money to Bloody Scoundrel.

1697
02:08:25,981 --> 02:08:27,039
Aren't l too good?

1698
02:08:31,687 --> 02:08:34,212
l had boarded the plane
after the security check,

1699
02:08:36,225 --> 02:08:37,283
but could not take off.

1700
02:08:40,696 --> 02:08:42,891
For the first time, it was no fun.

1701
02:08:46,068 --> 02:08:49,435
l conned girls because l
thought it was a game,

1702
02:08:50,806 --> 02:08:51,864
which l would win.

1703
02:08:54,343 --> 02:08:55,901
l never stopped to think,

1704
02:08:55,978 --> 02:08:59,914
that along with cash,
what else the girls lost.

1705
02:09:02,317 --> 02:09:03,443
Now that l know,

1706
02:09:05,854 --> 02:09:06,912
the game is no fun.

1707
02:09:11,293 --> 02:09:13,022
l thought l was
superstar Shahrukh Khan,

1708
02:09:15,364 --> 02:09:16,422
but this time,

1709
02:09:19,134 --> 02:09:20,192
even though l won, l have lost.

1710
02:09:34,383 --> 02:09:35,441
Your money.

1711
02:09:37,786 --> 02:09:38,844
lts 1 crore

1712
02:09:50,499 --> 02:09:52,967
You have straightened
this Bloody Scoundrel out.

1713
02:09:55,871 --> 02:09:57,304
l can't do con jobs anymore,

1714
02:09:59,041 --> 02:10:00,770
and l know nothing else.

1715
02:10:02,878 --> 02:10:03,936
Thanks to you all,

1716
02:10:05,214 --> 02:10:07,774
l will have to learn honest work.

1717
02:10:10,519 --> 02:10:14,421
l am not good at saying sorry,

1718
02:10:15,791 --> 02:10:16,849
so

1719
02:10:21,463 --> 02:10:22,521
Hats off boss!

1720
02:10:23,966 --> 02:10:25,024
Hats off

1721
02:10:37,546 --> 02:10:40,811
lf you ever meet lshika,
tell her my proposal was real.

1722
02:10:43,118 --> 02:10:44,449
l really fell in love with her.

1723
02:10:47,956 --> 02:10:49,446
But she turned out
to be a real player,

1724
02:10:51,827 --> 02:10:53,124
hats off to her as well.

1725
02:11:03,939 --> 02:11:05,201
Abhay Salaskar!

1726
02:11:07,576 --> 02:11:09,441
How does he come up with these names?

1727
02:11:14,349 --> 02:11:16,840
Sunny and l were dating seriously...

1728
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:20,850
and l wondered why
isn't he going first base?

1729
02:11:22,257 --> 02:11:23,315
First what?

1730
02:11:23,859 --> 02:11:24,917
Kissing!

1731
02:11:25,527 --> 02:11:27,119
So l thought, l'd take him there.

1732
02:11:27,596 --> 02:11:29,120
l came on to him in the night club,

1733
02:11:29,264 --> 02:11:33,223
but he didn't kiss me.

1734
02:11:35,337 --> 02:11:37,168
He could have taken advantage,
l was ready,

1735
02:11:40,008 --> 02:11:41,873
but he didn't exploit me.

1736
02:11:49,618 --> 02:11:52,610
But he doesn't know how
much lshika loves him right?

1737
02:11:53,522 --> 02:11:56,082
No, only we know.

1738
02:12:04,333 --> 02:12:06,062
No, no, don't do that.

1739
02:12:06,268 --> 02:12:07,633

Sorry sir,

1747
02:12:39,935 --> 02:12:41,960
l think you are
looking for another lshika,

1748
02:12:43,005 --> 02:12:44,302
l am lshika Desai,

1749
02:12:45,073 --> 02:12:46,131
a small time sales girl,

1750
02:12:46,341 --> 02:12:47,569
my salary is 25,000 rupees.

1751
02:12:48,677 --> 02:12:50,304
l am sure l am no good to you.

1752
02:12:51,680 --> 02:12:55,013
By the way we have a 25%
discount in all the sections

1753

please do check it out,

1754
02:12:56,351 --> 02:12:57,579
Won't you ask me why l came back?

1755
02:13:06,094 --> 02:13:07,152
Not really,

1756
02:13:09,031 --> 02:13:10,123
l am 22 years old,

1757
02:13:11,433 --> 02:13:13,333
l have a lot to achieve,
a lot to earn.

1758
02:13:15,370 --> 02:13:18,168
l went off track once and lost out

1759
02:13:19,374 --> 02:13:20,500
but now l won't make a mistake,

1760
02:13:21,310 --> 02:13:22,436
l want to mint money.

1761
02:13:22,711 --> 02:13:23,973
Not a good plan!

1762
02:13:24,713 --> 02:13:25,975
l've been there done that.

1763
02:13:27,082 --> 02:13:29,073
lt's no fun making money on your own.

1764
02:13:31,053 --> 02:13:33,283
Let's be partners,

1765
02:13:34,189 --> 02:13:36,987
same deal 60 yours, 40 mine.

1766
02:13:38,427 --> 02:13:40,019
No lies, no cheating.

1767
02:13:40,996 --> 02:13:43,430
Your brains, my courage,

1768
02:13:45,167 --> 02:13:46,634
world's best partnership.

1769
02:13:50,138 --> 02:13:52,072
You've conned 31 girls right?

1770
02:13:53,742 --> 02:13:55,107
l don't want to be 32nd.

1771
02:13:57,012 --> 02:13:59,071
l will constantly be
seeking the truth in your lies.

1772
02:14:00,215 --> 02:14:02,513
l was telling the truth then,
l am telling the truth now.

1773
02:14:04,152 --> 02:14:06,552
You were lying then,
you are lying now.

1774
02:14:09,624 --> 02:14:12,149
You might feign anger but
your eyes are saying, clearly,

1775
02:14:12,227 --> 02:14:13,751
that you are happy to see me here.

1776
02:14:17,766 --> 02:14:19,028
That's why we are made for each other,

1777
02:14:21,370 --> 02:14:23,167
we won't be able to lie to each other,

1778
02:14:23,238 --> 02:14:24,296
because we will be caught out.

1779
02:14:27,042 --> 02:14:29,772
A 100 % true partnership of two liars.

1780
02:14:31,713 --> 02:14:33,203
lf you are so in love with my lies,

1781
02:14:33,782 --> 02:14:35,044
then why did you leave me and go?

1782
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:36,683
lt was my last con,

1783
02:14:38,053 --> 02:14:39,145
how could l have lost?

1784
02:14:45,727 --> 02:14:47,558
lshika Desai, l love you...

1785
02:14:51,066 --> 02:14:52,124
Marry me

1786
02:14:53,168 --> 02:14:54,226
Straight to marriage,

1787
02:14:55,303 --> 02:14:56,793
don't you want to test me as
a girlfriend or something?

1788
02:14:57,806 --> 02:14:59,068
l am the No.1 conman,

1789
02:14:59,808 --> 02:15:01,708
l have checked
everything before attacking.

1790
02:15:04,813 --> 02:15:06,075
wait wait,

1791
02:15:09,351 --> 02:15:10,477
first tell me your real name.

1792
02:15:11,486 --> 02:15:12,544
Bahl,

1793
02:15:13,422 --> 02:15:14,480
Ricky Bahl

1794
02:15:17,826 --> 02:15:19,088
Ricky!

1795
02:15:20,128 --> 02:15:21,186
What kind of name is that?

1796
02:15:22,197 --> 02:15:24,097
l don't want to marry
a Ricky... l want to...

1797
02:15:41,116 --> 02:15:43,607
Dimple, don't worry...

1798
02:15:43,785 --> 02:15:47,277
we'll look for a much
better groom for you than Ricky.

1799
02:15:47,622 --> 02:15:50,557
l don't want him anymore,

1800
02:15:51,126 --> 02:15:52,718
l just want to go home...
to mummy papa.
