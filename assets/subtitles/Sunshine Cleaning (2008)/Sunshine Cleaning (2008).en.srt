1
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,194
Attention all fellow deer!

2
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:13,072
If you find deer feed
in the middle of the forest,

3
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,741
be a bit suspicious.

4
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,492
'Morning, sir.
How are you doing?

5
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,744
Good.

6
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,246
I'm looking for a 20-gauge,

7
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,083
maybe a Coach
or a Western Competition Special

8
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,169
Yeah, I think I have
just what you need.

9
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,301
- Try this one on for size.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,969
- Man: Hey, Cliff.
- Yeah?

11
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,597
The 12-gauge and 20-gauge shotgun
shells should be here by Thursday.

12
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,974
Cliff: Make it Tuesday
with the. 454 Casull.

13
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,898

Norah, the restaurant's on the phone.

45
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,195
All right, it was a 12-gauge?

46
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,947
A 20-gauge.

47
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,950
So it was a Coach gun?
You were behind the counter?

48
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,994
Sir, here's your contract.

49
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,581
I hate these shotgun cases-
a real pain in the ass.

50
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,625
And he had a shell in his pocket
when he came in here.

51
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,460
Inside his jacket.

52
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,921
- He brought his own ammo?
- Then he was up there.

53
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,007
The guy scattered all over this place,
and every blob of him a biohazard.

54
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,677
Hey, Carl, he's over here
in Fishing too.

55
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,680
Yeah, a real pain in the ass.

56
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,140
All right, thanks.

57
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,059
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

58
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,354
All right, we're wrapping it up.

59
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,358
Three grand just to wipe the asshole
up off the floor.

60
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,819
Hey, you can handle this report
tonight, can't you?

61
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,863
I got a thing I gotta do.

62
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,574
Is it a blonde thing
or a brunette thing?

63
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,834
You are strong.

64
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,878
You are powerful.

65
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,922
You can do anything.

66
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,092
You are a winner.

67
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,682
- Ooh. Hey.
- Aunt Norah's here.

68
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,059
Finally. Thank you.
I'm gonna be so late for class.

69
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,103
And she brought Crunchy Corn.

70
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,480
Crunchy Corn, Crunchy Corn,
Crunchy Crunchy Crunchy Corn.

71
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,191
- Hey.
- Sorry.

72
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,859
Mm!

73
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:23,406
Guys, don't eat too much of that.

74
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,367
He's gonna be hyper all night,
you realize that?

75
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,743
Yes. Yes, I do.

76
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,745
All right. How do I look?

77
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,831
- Oscar: Good.
- Yeah?

78
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,709
I'm kidding.

79
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,419
I love you.

80
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,462
And don't tell him any more
Lobster Man stories.

81
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,297
He had nightmares all week.

82
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,592
Okay, just use some
common sense, okay?

83
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,761
Okay. "Thank you so much. "
You're welcome.

84
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,890
He hears this horrible sound.

85
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,726
This is how it goes.

86
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,769
Snap.

87
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,188
Snap, drag.

88
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,441
Snap. Snap, drag.

89
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,484
And the thing is that he knows

90
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,195
that Lobster Man
is out there somewhere,

91
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,614
and he's totally screwed

92
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,825
'cause his tongue
is stuck to the mailbox.

93
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,161
Well, then why did he lick
the mailbox?

94
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,080
Because he has OCD

95
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,624
and is obsessed with
licking mailboxes.

96
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,127
Well, then why wasn't he
in school?

97
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,880
Are you gonna let me tell the story
or are you gonna drive me crazy?

98
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,341
Well, maybe he didn't go to school
because he had the ACD.

99
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,640
Sorry.

100
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,354
You should hear the way he goes on

101
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,399
about his lean body mass

102
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,610
weight index bullshit. God.

103
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,781
When was the last time
you even played basketball, Mac?

104
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,824
He needed to be brought down
a peg or two.

105
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,496
I'm sure you pulling your groin muscle
really impressed him.

106
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,790
I should introduce him
to your sister.

107
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:59,376
Oh, yeah, Norah and a cop-
that's a good idea.

108
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,091
Hey, you know, I was working
a scene today

109
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,552
where this guy offed himself
in a sporting goods store.

110
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,388
So they brought this
cleaning crew in, right?

111
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,558
You would not believe
how much they charge for that shit.

112
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,394
With the body there?

113
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,439
No, the body's gone.
It's just blood and stuff.

114
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,941
That's gross.

115
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,859
Yeah, well, if you ask me,
it's a racket.

116
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,070
You ought to get into that.

117
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,490
Do you think that's all I can do,
is clean up other people's shit?

118
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,536
Come here.

119
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,039
Come here.

120
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,557
You know that's not what I think.

121
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,894
- Will there be anything else?
- Yes, please.

122
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,857
- Yes, sir.
- A cup of coffee and your name.

123
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,526
Waitress: Oh, forgive me.
I forgot my nametag.

124
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,194
Customer: Yeah, I noticed.

125
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,030
- Waitress: It's Emma Jean.
- Emma Jean, I'm Stan.

126
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,575
Nice to meet you, Stan.

127
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,244
Hey.

128
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,998
I thought your class got over at 9:30.

129
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,792
Why isn't he in bed?

130
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:25,754
He said he was scared.
I think he was faking it, though.

131
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,966
Here.

132
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,050
No, don't.

133
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,136
- Take it. It's $10.
- No.

134
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,763
I know you need it.
Dad told me about you getting fired.

135
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,142
Great.

136
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,269
What happened?

137
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,565
You know what, Norah?

138
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,651
When you're gonna grow up
and start taking responsibility

139
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,445
and start taking some pride...

140
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,323
Rose, you love it
when I fuck up, okay?

141
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,742
Me screwing up
gives you the hugest woody.

142
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,493
Shh.

143
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,205
Take the money.

144
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,040
Please.

145
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:09,048
There was a diner scene earlier,

146
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,591
with a waitress.

147
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,219
Any pie?

148
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,722
Completely pie-free.

149
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,195
Hi.

150
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,405
Excuse me, we're all finished.

151
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,409
Because it's our first visit,
we did the blinds and the appliances,

152
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,788
but we're gonna alternate those
weekly in the future.

153
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,498
- And nobody mentioned-
- Rose?

154
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,210
Rose Lorkowski.

155
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,545
Yeah.

156
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,049
Paula Datzman,
cheerleading squad, junior year.

157
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,261
Paula Datzman, hi.

158
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,722
Wow. How are you?

159
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:03,060
Great.
Well, I'm Paula Datzman-Mead now.

160
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,688
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thanks.

161
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,483
We're expecting our second
in a couple of months.

162
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,945
God, you know, I was always
so envious of you-

163
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,782
head cheerleader,
dating the quarterback.

164
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,828
Did you and Mac
end up getting married?

165
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,791
No. No, you know,

166
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,461
I heard that he married
Heather Volkmann.

167
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,340
It's so great seeing you.

168
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,968
- Here, let me get your information.
- Okay.

169
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,721
And I'll send you an invite
to the baby shower.

170
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,516
Fantastic. Great.

171
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,226
It'll be like a big reunion.

172
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,312
The whole gang from high school
is gonna be there.

173
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,939
Yeah?

174
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,441
So what are you doing now?

175
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,153
I just got my real estate license.

176
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,114
Real estate?

177
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,158
Yeah, this is just a temporary thing

178
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,660
until I phase over into real estate
full time.

179
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,455
You're kidding. I'm in real estate
with Long & Foster.

180
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,956
Really?

181
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,958
Who are you with?

182
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:12,296
Me? I haven't decided yet.

183
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,008
Maybe I'll check out Long & Foster.
They look nice.

184
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,776
Come on.

185
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,579
Shit.

186
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,751
Hello.

187
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,878
- Hello, Miss Lorkowski?
- Yeah.

188
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,547
This is Mrs. Pierce
from Sandy Elementary School.

189
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,008
- Oscar's in trouble again.
- Okay.

190
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,344
His teacher and the principal
are in conference,

191
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,430
and they really want to meet
with you immediately.

192
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,202
It's not just this incident.

193
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:29,706
There have been
several episodes during the last year

194
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,126
where Oscar has engaged

195
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,753
in disruptive behavior.

196
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,297
There was the incident
in the gym class.

197
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,425
I paid the damages for that.

198
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,885
And the time when he locked
Jeremy Johnston in the-

199
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,596
Okay okay.

200
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,473
What did he do this time?

201
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,726
Now it's licking.

202
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,646
First it was the pencil sharpener

203
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,690
and then the aquarium.

204
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,026
It's unsanitary and it's disturbing
to the other children.

205
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:02,573
We feel that Oscar might benefit
from an environment

206
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,659
where he could receive
more specialized attention.

207
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,912
What does that mean,

208
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,790
"specialized attention"?

209
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,209
He licked my leg.

210
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,256
Principal: In situations like this

211
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,468
- we generally recommend medication.
- I'm not doing that.

212
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:27,014
Actually, it's not so much
a recommendation as it is a requirement.

213
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,434
There are many drugs
that are very effective

214
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,644
with very few side effects.

215
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,733
We all feel that this is the best
solution for everybody involved.

216
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,776
Sure. Come on, let's go.

217
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,778
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- It's okay.

218
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,363
It's not you. It's them.

219
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,200
I'll tell you one thing for sure-
we are not coming back here.

220
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,702
Okay? Okay.

221
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,955
We just have to figure something out.

222
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,043
I'll just figure something out.

223
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,010
- Hi. Is your daddy home?
- Girl: Yeah.

224
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,221
- Can I talk to him?
- Sure.

225
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,640
Hello.

226
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,975
Hi, Mac. It's me.

227
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,811
What are you calling here for?

228
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:18,023
I know. I'm sorry,
but I really needed to talk to you.

229
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,442
Look, Heather could have
easily picked up.

230
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,986
They want to put Oscar
on medication

231
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,822
and I need to get him out of this school
and get him into a private school

232
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,658
or something, I don't know.

233
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,701
Mac: Why don't we talk
about this later?

234
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,329
Because it can't wait, Mac.

235
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,666
I need to make some money. I need
to make some good money, like, now.

236
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,377
What about that crime-scene thing
I told you about?

237
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,629
Rose: I know, but do they make
good money?

238
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,506
Yeah, it seems like they do
pretty well.

239
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,800
And it's just like cleaning up a house

240
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,510
but there's blood there?

241
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,512
Yeah, basically- body fluids.

242
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,306
Okay.

243
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,684
So do you think that you could
hook me up with that

244
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,019
with your connections or...?

245
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,312
Please?

246
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,648
Okay. Right, yeah.
Let's talk later.

247
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,066
I gotta go. Bye.

248
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,542
So what do you think?

249
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,048
- Norah.
- What?

250
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,800
Norah, are you even
listening to me?

251
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,343
No, thank you.

252
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,262
What else do you have to do?
You don't go to school.

253
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,639
You don't have a job and you live
with Dad. And no offense, Dad,

254
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,058
but do you really want to live
with Dad for the rest of your life?

255
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,228
You really think you can make a ton
of cash cleaning up after dead people?

256
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,440
I know I can.
It's very lucrative.

257
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,483
- Let's have a nice pleasant dinner.
- It's a racket.

258
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,153
Rose, you buy generic cigarettes
with couch change.

259
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,071
How are you gonna afford
private school?

260
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,407
It's only until I get
my real estate license.

261
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,075
And I quit smoking, by the way.

262
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,578
- Who's going to private school?
- Nobody, Dad.

263
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,247
- Did Oscar get kicked out again?
- Yeah.

264
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,790
- No.
- Oh, for God's sake, what is wrong

265
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,043
with those people?
He's an imaginative kid.

266
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,753
Don't they have any sense at all?

267
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,796
I want to have my birthday at Hinkle's.

268
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,425
No Hinkle's this year.
This year I'm taking you to Disneyland.

269
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,551
- Dad.
- Really?

270
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:10,927
- I'm taking him to Disneyland.
- Dad, don't.

271
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,472
I'm taking him to Disneyland.

272
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,891
Who wants to split a combination plate?

273
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,062
- Hi there.
- Joe: Hi.

274
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,566
- Norah.
- Hi, Grandpa.

275
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,693
Norah.

276
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,029
Come on, I'm here.

277
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,114
- Are you sure you're okay with this?
- Yeah, absolutely.

278
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,949
But this boy's got to
get back to school.

279
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,618
What are you doing
about school?

280
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,703
I'm working on it.
Thank you.

281
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,957
What did Mac tell you
about this, Rose?

282
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,834
It's a crime scene.

283
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,003
- With blood?
- Maybe.

284
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,089
I hate Mac.

285
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,766
Hi.

286
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,396
Some sort of domestic disturbance
kind of deal.

287
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,107
It was the lady got the last word,
I guess,

288
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,734
but of course she's in jail now.

289
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,572
I heard one bullet completely
shot off his ring finger.

290
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,243
How long have you guys been doing
this kind of work?

291
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,620
A while.

292
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,874
The last one on the left there.

293
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,639
It's fine.

294
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:07,669
I found it.

295
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,846
Do you think they loved each other?

296
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,892
Yeah.

297
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,944
Car. Things.

298
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,154
Yeah.

299
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,246
Norah: Ew.

300
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,921
Spritz.

301
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,261
It's not working.

302
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,388
If you scrub and I wipe,
then it works.

303
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,433
- I'm spraying as well.
- Can you spray and scrub?

304
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:07,354
Joe: More and more people
are turning to wholesome foods.

305
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,065
Are you telling me this fancy corn
stuff is some kind of health food?

306
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,901
Well, it's candy and it's a health food.
That's what I'm telling you, yeah.

307
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,903
- Yeah, I don't know.
- Here.

308
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,197
- We don't have much more shelf space.
- Right, okay.

309
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,366
Look at the ingredients in here.
What does this say?

310
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,409
Look at that- glycerone-

311
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,370
glyc- gly-

312
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,456
I can't even pronounce it.
It's all chemicals.

313
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,626
How can you call it food
if it hasn't got any vowels in it?

314
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,837
Take a look at this now.
What has it got in there?

315
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,839
- High fructose-
- No no no. Look.

316
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,133
The first ingredient there is...

317
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,844
- Corn.
- Corn!

318
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,180
Corn- can you imagine
anything more healthful than corn?

319
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:45,433
It's made right here
in Albuquerque too.

320
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,562
You know, I've been reading
that the chemicals...

321
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,398
Hey, do you know if they sell
fancy corn here?

322
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,358
I don't know.

323
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:57,279
I heard the strawberry fancy corn
gives you bionic strength.

324
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,447
It's true.

325
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,741
There's some sort of chemical
in strawberry flavor.

326
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:05,203
And that means if you eat a whole
lot of it, you get bionic strength.

327
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,955
I don't believe you.

328
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,624
I don't care if you do or not.

329
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,626
Joe: You're not gonna get rid
of me very easily.

330
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,628
Man: Well, I understand that as well.
However,

331
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,881
I don't have any room on the shelf
for your product.

332
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,717
- Joe: Yeah, well-
- Like I said,

333
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,136
I already put in all the orders
I want for this year.

334
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,307
Excuse me, do you carry something
called fancy corn?

335
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,935
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!

336
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,230
That was really something, Oscar.
That was really terrific.

337
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,274
You got the moves.
You got the nerve.

338
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,276
You're a real sharp cookie.

339
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,820
- No, I'm not. I'm stupid.
- No, you're not.

340
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,323
Why are you saying that?
Why do you say you're stupid?

341
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,492
It's true. The teachers want
to put me in retard class.

342
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,161
Who wants to put you
in retard class?

343
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,163
The teachers.

344
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,916
They don't know how to deal
with somebody as intelligent as you are,

345
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,044
that's what the problem is.
You are a very very smart kid.

346
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,754
- Do you get bored a lot?
- Yeah.

347
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,589
- Do you look out the window?
- All the time.

348
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,884
That proves how intelligent you are.
They should be catering to you.

349
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,761
They should be doing
something special for you.

350
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,055
- You really think so?
- I know so.

351
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,849
On top of that, I think you're
a goddamn genius.

352
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:11,895
Hi.

353
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,897
You gals did a real nice job.

354
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,857
Thank you.

355
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,860
$500.

356
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,488
You can call us anytime.

357
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,991
Call you anytime.

358
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,620
It was so disgusting.

359
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,623
And the smell was just bad.

360
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,916
Yeah.

361
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,044
I can't even really describe it.

362
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,506
But, you know,
we took all that stuff away

363
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,049
- and we made it better.
- Yeah.

364
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,550
We made it right.

365
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,095
Hey, I'm really sorry.

366
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,680
No.

367
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,641
No, I feel like I got you
into this mess.

368
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,559
You know what I'm gonna do?

369
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,645
I'm gonna pay for your
real estate classes.

370
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,230
Okay?

371
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,648
You can get your license,

372
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,485
get your little picture
in the Real Estate section.

373
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,321
And then you can drive
people around all day

374
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:06,199
talking about-

375
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,203
gosh, what would you talk about?

376
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,501
Crown molding?

377
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,504
I'll definitely talk about
crown molding.

378
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:28,138
Um, square footage.

379
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,598
Oh, yeah.

380
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,645
- Property easements.
- Oh, yeah.

381
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,942
- Appliances.
- Yes.

382
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,239
- Come on, what else? Come on.
- You're crazy.

383
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,491
Come on, what?

384
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,871
Why did you pick Heather?

385
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,330
What?

386
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,752
Why did you pick her?

387
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:02,380
Come on, you know
it wasn't like that.

388
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,551
How was it like?

389
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,636
Okay, if this is gonna get all-

390
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,430
No no, don't.

391
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,481
Okay?

392
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,235
Norah: How long is this gonna take?

393
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,237
Rose: All we have to do is go in there

394
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,324
and throw everything away- cake.

395
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,747
Oh. Oh my God.

396
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,792
I think it just takes
a little getting used to.

397
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,086
Just give it some time.

398
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:06,694
Great. Now we're gonna have to
clean that up too.

399
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,838
We need to get the stink out.

400
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,548
What do we do with that?

401
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,093
Dumpster.

402
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,719
Come on.

403
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,853
Oh, God, it smells bad.

404
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,065
Slow down. Fuck, Rose,
just slow down.

405
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,317
- I'm not going fast, Norah.
- You are going fast.

406
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,319
No, I'm not. How can I be
walking faster than you?

407
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,071
I'm walking backwards.
I have the hard job.

408
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,490
You're in control of it.
You're the one pulling it.

409
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,743
- How can I pulling it?
- I haven't got a good grip on it, Rose.

410
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,579
- Fucking slow down.
- Here.

411
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:02,250
Oh my God, Rose,
you fucking idiot.

412
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,086
My face is burning.

413
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,758
You know what?
You fucking do it yourself, dumbass.

414
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,261
- Norah, come on.
- Do it on your own, idiot.

415
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,263
It'll wash out.

416
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:27,859
Where did you get those?
What are you doing with those?

417
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,861
I found them in the closet.

418
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,031
Let me take a look at them
for a minute.

419
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,741
Let me see them.

420
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,951
Let me look at them.
They're not yours, Oscar.

421
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,495
Let me look at them.

422
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,124
You'd better let me hang onto these
for a while, Oscar.

423
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,667
Why?

424
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,003
Because they belonged
to your grandma.

425
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,880
But I don't have a grandma.

426
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,508
Well, you used to have one. And when
you had one, these were her glasses.

427
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,721
- I'll get you another pair.
- Really?

428
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,640
Yeah, I'll get you a better pair
than this.

429
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,476
Okay.

430
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,067
I think it, like, seems wrong

431
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,612
to throw everything away
like we're erasing her, you know.

432
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,031
It's our job.

433
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,498
I bet this is her.
I bet that's her.

434
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,292
Probably.

435
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,343
Look at this.
Rose, look at this.

436
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:41,015
It's her daughter, I think.

437
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,271
Shouldn't we do something,
like try and find her or something?

438
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:50,108
It's none of our business, Norah.

439
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,610
What? What? What?

440
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,114
Just give me the dustpan.

441
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,700
I got it.

442
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,125
What if she doesn't know?

443
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,420
I mean, wouldn't you want to know
if this was Mom?

444
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:15,341
Mom was not like this.
Mom never would have been like this.

445
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,864
- Winston.
- Hi.

446
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,408
Hi. I spoke with you on the phone.
I'm Rose Lorkowski.

447
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,452
- Hi, Rose. How are you doing?
- Hello.

448
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,705
So our situation is that...

449
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,294
we are doing some post-mortem

450
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,505
kind of specialized cleanup stuff

451
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,341
- and we had this really difficult...
- Smelly.

452
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,176
...really smelly job

453
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,220
where this woman had died
and she'd been there for a while.

454
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,971
A decomp.

455
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,391
Yes, a decomp.

456
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:47,975
Follow me.

457
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,894
Rose: The lingo, I guess.

458
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,357
You have your
general-purpose cleaners,

459
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,776
your extraction cleaners,
your odor control,

460
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,154
disinfectants, stain removers
and shampoos.

461
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,990
Steamers, buffers, foggers-
that kind of stuff's right here

462
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,742
for rent or purchase.

463
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:08,162
And quick-absorbing sawdust-
it's good for vomit.

464
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,706
Personal protective gear
is right there.

465
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,500
If you have any questions,
come find me.

466
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,297
- Cut it out.
- Let's get what we need.

467
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,759
Suits, protective wear or something.

468
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,972
Just go over there.

469
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,683
- I'm on it.
- Just get stuff.

470
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,311
- Winston.
- Hey, how are you doing, Carl?

471
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,106
Did you hear there's a couple
of amateurs poaching jobs?

472
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,941
No, I didn't.

473
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,277
Carl: Bruce said they did a decomp
for 500 bucks.

474
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,154
- Winston: 500?
- Yeah.

475
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,614
What do you want to bet they threw
all that shit right in the dumpster?

476
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,159
Well, I certainly hope not.
What else you got there?

477
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:49,996
I got five gallons of Quick-Dissolve
and this here.

478
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,248
- Have a good day.
- You too, brother. See you soon, Carl.

479
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,047
Rose.

480
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:07,555
One, two, three, four, five of those.

481
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,307
Five.

482
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,101
I have that puzzle.

483
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:15,021
It's a tough one.

484
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:18,566
I got lost in the fur and gave up.

485
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,236
That's $68.24.

486
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,905
Do you like cats?

487
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,453
Nice going. You freaked him out.

488
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,914
I asked him if he liked cats.
I was being nice.

489
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,999
You want to bring these back
when you're done-

490
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:39,128
rules and regulations,
biohazard cleanup, you know?

491
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,257
For you.

492
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,093
How much was that again?

493
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,433
Turns out it's against the law
to throw biohazards in the dumpster.

494
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,602
Who knew?

495
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,731
How perfect was he
with the one arm?

496
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,024
Hmm?

497
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,903
The creepy guy, you know.
I wonder if he was born like that.

498
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,404
He wasn't creepy.

499
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,114
Dude, he has one arm.

500
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,410
They think we're a couple of hacks.

501
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,038
We are a couple of hacks.

502
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,040
Oh, okay, here it is.

503
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,667
Let me out here.

504
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:18,793
Why?

505
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,379
Because I got shit to do, okay?

506
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,964
I got a thing.

507
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,052
I'm dropping Oscar off at 7:00.

508
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,804
You got class tonight?

509
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,306
Mortgage Lenders and Financing.

510
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,183
Mortgage Lenders?

511
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,146
Well, Heather's pregnant again.

512
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:44,068
Do you know that?

513
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,362
He's never gonna leave her.

514
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,158
You're pathetic.

515
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,141
"Wiseman. "

516
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,314
Why are you following me?

517
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,483
I'm not following you.

518
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,568
- You're following me.
- No.

519
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,321
- You're following me.
- No, I'm not.

520
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,698
- You're not?
- Following you- no.

521
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,206
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,751
I really thought
you were following me.

523
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,753
It's all right.

524
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,758
Now it's not moving.

525
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,427
Maybe if we push the alarm.

526
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,683
I'm sure it'll start up in a minute.

527
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,863
Again, I'm really sorry.

528
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,491
Don't even worry about it.

529
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,790
You have nice veins.

530
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,463
You should give blood.

531
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,986
Yeah, could you check
if there's any messages for me?

532
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,821
Room 211.

533
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,743
Okay.

534
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,162
Thank you.

535
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,501
I am strong.

536
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,213
I am powerful.

537
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:55,092
I am a fucking loser.

538
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,208
"Sunshine Cleaning. "

539
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,252
Yes, I thought we'd put
a positive spin on things.

540
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,170
- Nice.
- My son drew the design.

541
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:16,090
Hi there. That's a real nice job
you did there.

542
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,217
Um, where's your arm?

543
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,678
- Oscar.
- That's all right.

544
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,055
- I'm sorry.
- Kids.

545
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,515
- Kids.
- He's cute.

546
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,850
Thank you.

547
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,978
I was hoping that I could put
some of these out by the register.

548
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,272
Winston: Yes, sure.
Put them right over there.

549
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,777
This is great, but you guys
might want to consider

550
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,863
getting out there and really
marketing yourselves.

551
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,198
Marketing ourselves like-?

552
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:44,702
Like funeral homes,
property managers.

553
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,872
You can get in with insurance companies.
They'll throw you a ton of work.

554
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,915
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

555
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,959
- Insurance companies?
- Oh, yeah.

556
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,044
That's a really good idea.

557
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,756
You guys have your BBP, right?

558
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,550
A BB-what?

559
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,261
Your BBP- bloodborne pathogens
certification.

560
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,139
No, I don't.

561
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,897
I could sign you up
for the next seminar if you'd like.

562
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,066
- Yeah, I'd like.
- Okay.

563
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,610
- Thank you.
- You're welcome,

564
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:20,863
Rose from Sunshine Cleaning.
You gotta love that.

565
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,995
Oscar: Sorry.

566
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:36,086
I think you're gonna like
this Econoline.

567
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,505
The girls have gone into their own
business, Sherm.

568
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,091
They're doing crime scene
and trauma cleanup.

569
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:44,595
- It's a real growth industry.
- Sounds kind of gory.

570
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,764
Yeah, it can be. It can be.

571
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:50,100
We're gonna be taking some contaminated
materials to the incinerator,

572
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,144
so we're gonna need
some space in the back.

573
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,855
- There you go.
- How much is it?

574
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,191
It's $1999.

575
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,778
Joe: Whoa. Any room
to come down on that?

576
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,780
Oh, that's the ground floor.

577
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,199
I'm probably gonna lose money
on this one.

578
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,117
I just want to make room
for some new product.

579
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,119
We can pay cash.

580
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,705
We have some cash.
We have some cash we can put down.

581
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,915
Cash is good.

582
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,833
What about all this rust here
on the thing?

583
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,794
- Character.
- Norah: That's bullshit.

584
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,004
Joe: We were just at Motor Mart
down on Lomas.

585
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:23,425
They had a Chevy G-series
for $1900.

586
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,969
Sherm: Power steering?

587
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,971
- Joe: Oh, yes.
- Rose: Yes.

588
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,973
What's this?

589
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,392
Oh, that's a CB.
What you do with that is

590
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:35,020
you push down on that thing
and hold that other thing down

591
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,107
and it makes your voice go up
in radio waves.

592
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,067
It goes right into the heavens.

593
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,361
- Heaven?
- Uh-huh.

594
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:45,197
How about a test drive?

595
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,074
There you go.

596
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,427
And don't forget about
some personal protective equipment.

597
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,766
Oh, shit.

598
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,893
Shit. Fuck. Shit.

599
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,864
What, you think I don't know?

600
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,285
You may have been hot shit
in high school.

601
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,538
What are you now, hmm?

602
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,377
Nothing.

603
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,473
Joe: Okay, you got 20 bucks
and you want to buy three pizzas.

604
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,893
The pizzas cost $3 apiece.

605
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,479
No, let's make that $5 apiece.

606
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,149
You got a coupon that takes $2 off.

607
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,651
Okay, $2.

608
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,654
The delivery boy shows up.

609
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,574
He's a friend from school
who's very very poor,

610
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,492
so you give him a tip
of five bucks.

611
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,619
- Okay, $5.
- What do you end up with?

612
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:42,583
Okay, you have $2 left,
and you spent $18.

613
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,960
You just figured that out?

614
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,254
Yeah, it's not that hard.

615
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,425
Here's Frank.

616
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,025
That's it. There's our shrimp.

617
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,985
They look pretty damn good.

618
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,487
Shove them in there.

619
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,531
How many boxes we got?

620
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:22,372
See? That's the difference
between an ordinary person

621
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:24,124
and a person
with business acumen.

622
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,168
That's a good word for you to remember-

623
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,920
business acumen.

624
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,505
We're gonna be rich, pal.

625
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,432
We're gonna make some money grow
because that's the smart way.

626
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,602
It's capital, and you don't spend that.
You invest it.

627
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:47,814
So that way we can get the new SP250
and have money left over.

628
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:48,982
What are you talking about?

629
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,985
The binoculars Grandpa's getting me
for my birthday.

630
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,198
What binoculars Grandpa's
getting you for your birthday?

631
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,662
These binoculars.

632
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,456
They've got some internal
stabilizer thing. It's electronic.

633
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,125
So that way if you're on a speedboat
or something, it won't matter.

634
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,962
And when it's really cold outside,
they won't freeze, so-

635
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,256
Honey, honey, come here.

636
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,590
Listen to me.

637
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:16,051
Sometimes Grandpa
promises things

638
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:19,304
and he really wants
to make it happen, you know?

639
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:21,265
No, he's really gonna get them.

640
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,558
He has a plan.

641
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,811
- He has a plan?
- Mm-hmm.

642
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,480
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

643
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,150
Okay, if you say so.

644
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,029
Lynn: Squeeze that for me.

645
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,490
Again.

646
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,493
Don't be nervous.
People do this all the time.

647
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,288
I'm not nervous. I'm fine.

648
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:48,292
Oh, that's the needle?

649
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,003
That's a fucking cocktail straw.

650
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,297
Trust me. I'm really good at this.

651
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,471
Okay.

652
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,973
Wasn't that fun?

653
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,350
I think you might have oversold it.

654
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,112
There's a thing tonight-

655
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,156
oh, never mind.

656
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,450
- What?
- No, it's nothing.

657
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:24,953
It's just my friend-

658
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,874
- What is it?
- You wouldn't like it.

659
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,209
I might like it.

660
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,591
Norah: I knew you wouldn't have
any fun here.

661
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,843
Lynn: No, I'm having a good time.

662
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,928
Norah: It's okay.

663
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,059
Oh, no, thanks.

664
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,436
It's just lamb's breath. It's mellow.

665
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,771
Yeah, thanks.

666
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,107
Straight edge?

667
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,943
No, I'm just-

668
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,864
What?

669
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,699
You'll just think it's weird.

670
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:05,035
What? No, I like weird stuff.

671
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,412
Okay.

672
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:11,041
Well, sometimes I think that
when you get high or when you drink,

673
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,585
- when you alter your consciousness-
- You don't drink either?

674
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:17,172
No. I just think that when you do
stuff like that,

675
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,634
it weakens you psychically,
like it creates cracks

676
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,512
and then bad stuff
can seep into those cracks

677
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:26,973
and maybe never go away.

678
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:29,101
That's so weird.

679
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:32,145
Sorry.

680
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,023
You should probably just
tell people you're a Mormon.

681
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,610
Maybe.

682
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:47,244
Your boyfriend's winning
the necklace game.

683
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:51,081
He's not really my boyfriend.

684
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:56,128
You just tickle my neck a little bit.

685
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,547
I'm totally gonna win.

686
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:06,930
You still have your whole necklace.

687
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:16,106
I like the white ones.

688
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,985
I'm gonna try a white one.

689
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,960
It's pretty good.

690
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:41,631
I need some beer.

691
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:53,977
- Man: What are you doing?
- This is Cary Fleming live at the scene

692
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,855
at Wyoming Indian School.
Tragedy struck today

693
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,774
when an out-of-control driver
crashed into this autoshop

694
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:00,984
killing one employee.

695
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,028
The driver of the automobile...

696
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,155
apparently suffered a heart attack
at the wheel

697
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,073
- and is in critical condition.
- Hello.

698
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,242
- Man: Unbelievable.
- Yeah, I'm watching it now.

699
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,329
Okay. All right.

700
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,498
Okay.

701
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,541
Dude, get off.

702
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,508
The guy's driving down here
and has a heart attack,

703
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,052
comes right through the front window
at a high rate of speed,

704
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,012
and hits one of the employees
in here.

705
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,098
The poor guy's in about five pieces
and there's quite a bit of blood.

706
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,059
You guys are BBP-certified, right?

707
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,436
We adhere to all proper procedures
when handling

708
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,231
potentially hazardous situations.
We're very professional.

709
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,067
- I thought you went to that thing.
- I did. I'm not done yet.

710
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:46,863
It's fine, trust me. If you could get
the Wet Vac and the Burnbox...

711
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:48,865
Are you guys all finished up in there?

712
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,367
Yeah.

713
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:53,620
Great, then I can handle it
from here, can't I?

714
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,555
What's a "bastard"?
Jeremy told me I was a bastard.

715
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,099
So what's a "bastard"?

716
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:17,686
It just means your mom wasn't married
when she had you.

717
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,229
It's no big deal.

718
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,690
You know, in a couple of years
you're gonna find

719
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:25,402
it's a free pass to cool, all right?

720
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:30,031
You'll probably start a band
called Bastard Son,

721
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:33,201
use it to impress the chicks.

722
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:36,037
The whole bastard thing
is working for you.

723
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,415
You're the coolest bastard I know.

724
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:41,209
- Really?
- Yeah.

725
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:43,712
Hello. Sunshine Cleaning.

726
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,256
Of course.

727
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,427
2327 Grove Avenue.

728
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,762
Okay, we got it.

729
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,472
No, thank you.

730
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,266
All right, goodbye.

731
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,560
What was that?

732
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,979
A suicide.

733
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:07,193
It's a good thing.

734
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,202
Oh, man.

735
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,913
Okay.

736
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:22,000
Stay in the van, okay?

737
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:25,879
If you get thirsty, there's some soda
in the blue cooler, okay, sweetie?

738
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,464
Okay.

739
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,011
Hi. Mrs. Davis?

740
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,220
Yes.

741
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,640
We're the cleaning crew.

742
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:40,185
Yes, I wanted to give you the keys.

743
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,103
Okay.

744
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,230
In the den

745
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,274
where my husband-

746
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,318
I had bread.

747
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,695
And when I-

748
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:55,241
Do you need me to show you?

749
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,786
Oh, no no no.

750
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,829
We can find it.

751
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,458
Okay, that's good then.

752
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,505
My son-in-law is coming

753
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,841
to take me to lunch
at the Howard Johnson's.

754
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:16,012
They have such nice rolls
at the Howard Johnson's.

755
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:19,766
Um...

756
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,311
Mrs. Davis.

757
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:27,273
Mrs. Davis,

758
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,068
would you like me to sit with you
for a little while?

759
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,278
Yes, dear.

760
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,322
I believe I would.

761
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:36,449
Okay.

762
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,859
Bye.

763
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,951
Is she okay?

764
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,578
Yeah, she'll be okay.

765
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,638
Oscar: Why is that lady so sad?

766
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,973
Rose: Well, her husband died

767
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,934
and she misses him.

768
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,144
Oscar: Maybe we could let her
use our CB.

769
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,063
And then she could talk to him.

770
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,697
Tengo mariscos para ustedes

771
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:42,325
at a very good,
very very good price.

772
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:46,329
Cien dólares para usted y...

773
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,748
I can give you a deal.

774
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,792
Smell these shrimp.

775
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,877
Take a whiff of these shrimp.

776
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,630
Yeah, it's good.

777
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,674
- Oh, no.
- ¿Por qué no?

778
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,342
No no no.

779
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,094
No no, digame.

780
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:14,983
- Lynn: Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

781
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,735
Norah, is that you?

782
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,195
Yeah.

783
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,198
Have you ever been trestling?

784
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,959
So when you're at the crime scenes,
are the bodies still there?

785
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,003
No, the bodies are gone.

786
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,046
But it's weird, you know,

787
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,048
'cause we're, like,
connected to them

788
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,385
in a strangely intimate way.

789
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,762
And, I don't know,

790
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,848
I guess it's weird.

791
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,862
I have seen a dead body once, though.

792
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,572
Really?

793
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,198
My mom.

794
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,580
She was in a Movie of the Week once,
you know.

795
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,082
- Really?
- Yeah.

796
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:16,544
There was this bunch
of Hollywood people

797
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:19,339
and they were filming
in Old Town.

798
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,382
And they saw my mom

799
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:23,635
and they just thought
she was beautiful

800
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:27,096
and talented,
'cause they gave her a speaking part.

801
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,348
Oh, yeah?

802
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,725
- Do you want to hear it?
- Mm-hmm.

803
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,102
"I recommend the pecan pie. "

804
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:36,356
"I recommend
the pecan pie. "

805
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,318
Yeah, that was her line.
That was it.

806
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,862
That's pretty cool.

807
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:45,615
It was on TV and everything.

808
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:53,247
Me and Rose didn't see it.

809
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:57,210
But Rose said that Mom
talked about it all the time.

810
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,339
I don't remember.

811
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,927
I don't remember her much at all.

812
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,808
But I have a box of her stuff.

813
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,560
Um...

814
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,188
it's just things that she touched

815
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:20,900
and little things.

816
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,404
How did she die?

817
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,576
It was a do-it-yourself kind of thing.

818
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,500
I think the train's coming.

819
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,544
Yeah.

820
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,587
Yeah. Yes, it is.

821
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,756
Oh, yeah, okay.
So this is where we climb

822
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,801
up to that girder.

823
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,854
What was I before I was born?

824
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,945
What happens when we die?

825
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,035
I'm not climbing up there.

826
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,412
Come on, this is trestling.

827
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,498
This is what it's all about.

828
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:21,544
It's like this big pissed-off God

829
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,714
and he's right up in your face,
like, screaming at you, you know?

830
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,384
He's so close,
you can smell the metal on his breath.

831
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:31,637
If you already live in heaven,

832
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:35,016
where do you go when you die?

833
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,655
Whoo!

834
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:57,997
Whoo!

835
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,891
Oscar: Can you see
everything down here?

836
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,650
Rose.

837
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:13,614
Hey, beautiful.

838
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:14,907
Hi.

839
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:23,416
I started thinking that you were
on a date or something.

840
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,752
I was-

841
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,339
I got you something.

842
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,008
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

843
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,719
It's for your business cards.

844
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:38,556
You put your cards in there

845
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,768
and, I don't know, impress people.

846
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,690
It's beautiful.

847
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,443
You don't like it?

848
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,697
Look, this thing

849
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:58,117
that we've been doing-
it's not-

850
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,122
Let's not do that.

851
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,461
I don't want this anymore.

852
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,133
So that's it.

853
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:33,152
That's it then.

854
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:01,013
Brown or flowery?

855
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,515
Brown.

856
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,849
- Sure?
- Mm-hmm.

857
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06,269
All right, good call.

858
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,521
Okay, go get your stuff together,
please.

859
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,439
Okay.

860
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,483
Thank you.

861
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:18,406
Sunshine Cleaning.

862
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,199
Hello, this is Henry Schmeer,
State Farm.

863
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:22,660
State Farm. Oh, State Farm. Hi.

864
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,830
- I spoke with you about a month ago.
- Yeah, what can I do for you?

865
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:28,291
We've got a house we need to turn around
and our regular guys

866
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:31,002
are busy in Santa Fe today.
I thought I'd give you a call.

867
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,628
Today?

868
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:35,798
The house on 60 Howard Avenue

869
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,551
in Antelope Springs.

870
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,970
All right. All right, thank you.

871
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,471
Bye-bye.

872
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:43,597
Shit.

873
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,266
Blow off the shower.

874
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,852
I can't blow it off. I RSVP'd.

875
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:52,064
- Just tell them we can't do it, Rose.
- This is an insurance company, Norah.

876
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,275
They can throw us a ton of business.
This is our in.

877
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:58,362
Yes, it's our in.
So don't go to the damn baby shower.

878
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:00,531
Norah, these are my old buddies
from high school.

879
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,117
It's really important to me.
Just go and get it started

880
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,703
and I promise I will come
and help you finish it up, okay?

881
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,539
- Fine. Fine.
- Thanks.

882
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:16,422
- Oh, pee-yew.
- Stay out here.

883
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,467
- But why do I always-?
- Because I said so. Stay here.

884
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:24,889
Dad.

885
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:27,600
Daddy.

886
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:31,062
Shit. Dad.

887
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:33,022
Oh, shit.

888
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,482
Damn it, you scared
the shit out of me.

889
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,359
I'm busy here.

890
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,864
Dad, what are you doing?

891
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,867
The goddamn restaurant bastards
wouldn't buy my shrimp,

892
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,870
giving me this crap about
the Board of Health or some bullshit.

893
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,790
They shut me out.
They just shut me out.

894
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:54,251
They got some kind of goddamn
restaurant syndicate, I'm sure of it.

895
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:03,260
Dad, I need you
to watch Oscar today.

896
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:05,679
- I can't.
- Why?

897
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,723
I can't. I'm busy today.

898
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,683
Dad, come on, I'm kind of
in a bind right now.

899
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:12,269
Yeah, well, it's tough bringing up a kid
by yourself, isn't it?

900
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:14,397
Try two.

901
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:31,205
I'm over here.

902
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,040
Hi.

903
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:37,044
Hi. I was wondering
if Oscar could hang out here with you

904
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:39,088
for a while.

905
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,798
Winston: I don't-

906
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:44,176
See, I have this baby shower thing

907
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:48,222
and Norah has a job
and my dad is incapacitated.

908
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:51,767
So would that be okay?

909
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:53,978
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

910
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:56,480
You are a lifesaver.

911
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:59,900
You did your hair different.

912
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:02,403
Yeah, I did.

913
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,238
Do you like it?
It's, you know-

914
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,906
Yeah, I do.

915
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:09,118
- All right, you be good, okay?
- Okay.

916
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,537
You be good.
And I will be back

917
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:14,039
as soon as I'm done
with everything.

918
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,417
Okay. You good? You okay?

919
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,294
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

920
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:19,587
You're welcome.

921
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:21,881
You'll do good, Rose. Okay.

922
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:25,634
All right. A Porsche- great.

923
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,308
Hi, it's good to see you.

924
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,854
Everybody is here. Fantastic.

925
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:42,860
Hello, everybody.

926
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,642
Ugh.

927
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:44,421
So, Rose, how are you doing?
Are you still cleaning houses?

928
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:46,799
No, that was just a temporary thing.

929
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,385
Rose has gone into real estate.

930
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:50,553
Really?

931
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,514
Actually, I own my own business.

932
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,474
Oh, what kind?
Is it a real estate business?

933
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:59,562
No, it's a biohazard removal

934
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:01,855
and crime-scene cleanup service.

935
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,483
It's a real growth niche industry.

936
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,777
It's highly competitive and technical.

937
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,113
And what is that exactly-

938
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,865
a biohazard removal whatever?

939
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,868
Well, a lot of times

940
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:16,912
when people die,

941
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,956
it can be kind of messy, you know.

942
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,001
So what we do is, we go in
and we clean up the mess

943
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:25,629
and make sure that everything
is clean and sanitary.

944
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:29,341
'Cause people don't realize
the safety risks

945
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:33,178
involved with the removal
of blood and body fluid.

946
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:37,141
I cannot imagine.

947
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,268
You like doing it?

948
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,729
Yeah.

949
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,523
I do.

950
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:48,027
Um, we come into people's lives

951
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:52,906
when they have experienced
something profound and sad-

952
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:56,535
they've lost somebody, you know?

953
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:00,080
And the circumstances-

954
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,915
they're always different,

955
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,959
but that's the same.

956
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:07,630
And we help.

957
01:06:10,342 --> 01:06:13,761
In some small way, we-

958
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:16,972
we help.

959
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,570
What's that?

960
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,614
That is a propeller.

961
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:36,492
And when I'm done prepping this wing,
it will go on the end.

962
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:37,993
Like that?

963
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:39,578
Yeah.

964
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,997
It doesn't fly.

965
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:44,792
Right, like my helicopter.

966
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:54,426
Must be hard to build models
with just one hand.

967
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,763
It is.

968
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:02,309
Yeah.

969
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:19,868
No no no no no.

970
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,621
Come on, kitty.

971
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,419
Here, kitty kitty kitty.

972
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:32,798
Good kitty. Good kitty.

973
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,842
Come on.

974
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:37,177
Aww, did you get left behind?

975
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:39,680
You are the sweetest thing.

976
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:42,766
You are the cutest thing ever.

977
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:46,311
Did you get left behind,
little kitty kitty kitty?

978
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:52,317
Oh, shit. Um, uh...

979
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,945
um..

980
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,989
shit.

981
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:00,242
Okay, can you stay there?

982
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,827
Oh my God.

983
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,669
Come on.

984
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,340
Fuck. Fuck.

985
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,346
Fuck.

986
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:28,437
Oh, please, help!

987
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,316
No, God damn it!

988
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,277
I've taken five different
chocolate bars

989
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,237
and melted them
in these diapers.

990
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:41,158
You can taste, look and smell.

991
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,911
And the first to guess
all five correctly, wins.

992
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,413
Crunchy.
Crunchy poop.

993
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,295
Um, Paula,

994
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,798
I'm sorry, I need to go.

995
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,342
There's somewhere
that I need to be.

996
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:02,179
No, you can't leave now.
We're just starting to play the games.

997
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,307
Yeah, well,

998
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:08,393
yeah.

999
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:38,841
Oh, no.

1000
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,180
Norah!

1001
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,600
Norah!

1002
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,729
Fuck. Norah.

1003
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:55,315
Norah,

1004
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,609
what happened?

1005
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,862
- It was an accident.
- You did this.

1006
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:02,364
- It was an accident.
- Oh my God.

1007
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,408
It was an accident, Rose.

1008
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:06,118
Oh my God.

1009
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,829
Norah, what the fuck happened?

1010
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:12,708
Norah, come out here.
Get out of this car.

1011
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,502
- Rose, calm down.
- I have to deal with this by myself.

1012
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:18,255
No, I am not going to calm down.
Fuck.

1013
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:20,424
- It was an accident.
- Oh my God.

1014
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:44,907
Winston. Winston.

1015
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:49,536
- Sorry.
- Hey, Rose. Are you okay?

1016
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:52,289
Just everything is really
horrible right now, you know?

1017
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,166
Oscar is asleep in the back.

1018
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,627
Okay, good. Good.

1019
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:59,922
Norah ruined everything.

1020
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,507
She burned down a house.

1021
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,968
A house- she burned down
a client's house.

1022
01:11:05,053 --> 01:11:06,970
Yeah.

1023
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:08,347
How do you know?

1024
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,182
Carl told me.

1025
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:13,894
How does he know?

1026
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:17,064
It's his job.
It's what he does.

1027
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,693
We burned down a client's house.

1028
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,112
How do you get around that?

1029
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,864
Insurance.

1030
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:32,245
Oh. See, I thought I would get
a better rate once I was certified.

1031
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:38,710
There's not a lot that I'm good at.

1032
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,007
I'm good at getting guys
to want me-

1033
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:46,551
not date me or marry me,
but want me.

1034
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:50,430
I am good at that.

1035
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:53,558
And-

1036
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,936
and cheering.

1037
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:59,314
I was really good at cheering.

1038
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:02,401
Cheering is good.

1039
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:06,780
Yeah, but it's not as marketable
as you'd think.

1040
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:28,552
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

1041
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,679
Do you mind keeping an eye
on Oscar for a while?

1042
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:31,847
Yeah, sure.

1043
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:34,266
I just gotta go get a couple
of my shifts back.

1044
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,477
Don't go back to being a maid.

1045
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:39,604
It's not a good job for you.

1046
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,898
Dad, I need a job.

1047
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:45,360
I owe, like, $40,000 on that house,
and that's on top of everything else.

1048
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:46,611
So I just-

1049
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:50,323
Yeah, well, you're not gonna earn
$40,000 by cleaning houses.

1050
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:53,452
I'll figure out something to do.

1051
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,412
I will.

1052
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:57,748
Can I make a sandwich?

1053
01:12:57,832 --> 01:13:01,001
Yeah, go ahead.
You know where everything is.

1054
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:06,840
Go make up with your sister.

1055
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,552
She's your sister.
Go make up with her.

1056
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,138
Dad, please.

1057
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,733
What's this?

1058
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,110
Just open it.

1059
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,126
Why do you have my mom's ID?

1060
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:46,254
I found it

1061
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:48,215
at work.

1062
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:50,759
Me and Rose did a job
a while back,

1063
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:55,180
and there was a woman

1064
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:59,434
who had-

1065
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:01,978
look, we're supposed
to throw everything away,

1066
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,106
but I mean, she kept
these pictures of you and I-

1067
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,024
This is her fanny pack?

1068
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:09,111
I couldn't throw them away.

1069
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,074
You were following me that day.

1070
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:16,326
I should have told you.
I know that.

1071
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:20,163
And I- so stupid,
I just got scared and I-

1072
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:24,543
I didn't know what the situation was

1073
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:26,628
between you and your mom.

1074
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,588
I don't know what went on.

1075
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:32,425
But I just thought that of everybody,
that I would understand.

1076
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:33,844
You would understand?

1077
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:36,888
My mom was a pathetic drunk.

1078
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,394
I'm an idiot.

1079
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:45,689
I actually thought
that you were interested in me.

1080
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:48,567
I just wanted
to do the right thing.

1081
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:51,653
- Please don't.
- Don't call me.

1082
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,878
- You got that?
- Yeah, it's light.

1083
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:10,463
I'm sure I'll be able
to turn this around pretty quick.

1084
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:13,175
Thank you for everything.

1085
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:17,220
Are you coming to my party?

1086
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:20,265
We're having Oscar's birthday party

1087
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,018
at Hinkle's on Saturday.
It'd be great if you came.

1088
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:24,728
Sounds like a blast.

1089
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,313
Oscar: Yes!

1090
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:36,072
I know what you're thinking, Oscar,

1091
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:39,201
but the ones we saw at the store
were full of gimmicks.

1092
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,203
They didn't have the heft
that these have.

1093
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,246
They didn't have the weight.
There's no history.

1094
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:45,457
Wow, is that an old Zeiss?

1095
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,791
Joe: Yeah.

1096
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,085
Some classic binoculars
you got there.

1097
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,879
Cool.

1098
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:54,341
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, look at you.

1099
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:57,219
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, dear.

1100
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:03,475
Where are you going?

1101
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,528
Get it together.

1102
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,794
Okay, I'm sorry.

1103
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:34,256
I know that you think
that I ruined everything

1104
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:37,759
and that I fucked up really huge,
and I'm sorry, okay?

1105
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,178
You know what I don't get, Norah?

1106
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:43,223
It's that I ask you to do one thing-

1107
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:46,142
I can't even ask you to do one thing
without you messing it up.

1108
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:48,603
I mean, Jesus, Norah, it's not like
I don't have enough

1109
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:51,398
to deal with in my own life, but now
I have to take care of you on top of it,

1110
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,608
and I can't.
It's too much. I can't do it.

1111
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:55,277
I'm not asking you to.

1112
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:58,405
This business was
everything to me, Norah.

1113
01:16:58,489 --> 01:16:59,948
Well, why weren't you there?

1114
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,492
I was going to be there.
I told you I was gonna be there.

1115
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:05,578
You couldn't just wait
to burn the house down?

1116
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:08,039
Yeah, but you weren't there
and I couldn't-

1117
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,875
I couldn't do it by myself.

1118
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,506
I just-

1119
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:21,636
I should have been there.
I know.

1120
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:24,723
But...

1121
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:32,230
I just-

1122
01:17:32,315 --> 01:17:35,900
I really wanted to go
to that baby shower.

1123
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:40,155
So stupid.

1124
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,910
I just didn't want those girls
looking at me like I was just a maid.

1125
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:49,831
You're better than them, Rose.

1126
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:56,504
What are you gonna do now?

1127
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,050
I don't know.

1128
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:02,594
They said that I could have
my old job back if I wanted.

1129
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,804
I can put in a good word for you.

1130
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,267
I don't need you
to take care of me anymore.

1131
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:14,939
It's not your job. It never was.

1132
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:22,614
Well, somebody had to take care
of you, Norah.

1133
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:33,625
You know what I remember
about her funeral?

1134
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:40,882
My shoes.

1135
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:45,053
They were too small
and my feet hurt.

1136
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,597
That's what I remember.

1137
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:53,520
You know what I remember?

1138
01:18:57,191 --> 01:19:01,111
You wouldn't take your shoes off
after that.

1139
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:06,533
You wore them forever.
It drove me crazy.

1140
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:24,467
I'm still mad at you.

1141
01:19:24,552 --> 01:19:27,220
- All right.
- Like, really mad at you.

1142
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,347
Okay.

1143
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:32,600
I hear you make model airplanes.

1144
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:35,019
Yeah.

1145
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,897
Is there any money in that?

1146
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:41,484
No, not really.

1147
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,488
Hey, what did you get?

1148
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:48,199
Winston gave it to me.

1149
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:50,326
Thank you.

1150
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:52,454
You're welcome.

1151
01:19:52,538 --> 01:19:54,497
You can open my present.

1152
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,792
Okay.

1153
01:19:57,877 --> 01:20:01,129
So the guy said that if you're careful
they'll last a whole month.

1154
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,965
- So you can't shower and shit.
- That's good.

1155
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,634
Now these are guaranteed to make you
look like a total badass.

1156
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,221
What does that say?

1157
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,307
"Lil Bastard. "

1158
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:15,810
Custom-made.

1159
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,731
It's cool, Norah.

1160
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:24,652
I'm thinking of taking a road trip.

1161
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,654
- Joe: Where?
- How?

1162
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:28,323
In the van.

1163
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:31,075
- No, I'm selling the van.
- What?

1164
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,119
Don't sell the van.

1165
01:20:33,204 --> 01:20:35,205
I can't afford the payments,
guys, come on.

1166
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:37,290
- Just wait a while.
- Give me a break, please.

- Pick up, pick up, pick up.
- Hello.

1172
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:27,423
Norah, turn on the TV, channel 65.

1173
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:42,146
Man: I probably shouldn't,
but what have you got for sweets?

1174
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,732
Oh, I recommend the pecan pie.

1175
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:47,819
All right.

1176
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:56,494
One pecan pie coming up.

1177
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:00,558
Hello.

1178
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:11,069
Mom?

1179
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,451
Today was Oscar's eighth birthday.

1180
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:23,331
And we did a big thing for him
at Hinkle's.

1181
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,794
And Winston came.

1182
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:31,839
After dinner Norah and Oscar
played centipede

1183
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:35,635
and put ASS as their initials

1184
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:38,471
and got in big trouble by the manager.

1185
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:45,311
I don't know

1186
01:23:45,396 --> 01:23:49,524
if you're in heaven or not,

1187
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:51,943
but I know that you're not here.

1188
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:55,738
And that is too bad for you,

1189
01:23:55,823 --> 01:23:58,116
because you really missed out.

1190
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:03,329
You've missed out
on some really great stuff.

1191
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,386
I hope you can hear me.

1192
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,137
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

1193
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:03,848
I gotta talk to you.

1194
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:04,974
Okay.

1195
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:07,393
I have to move in
with you and Oscar for a while.

1196
01:25:07,478 --> 01:25:09,353
- Why?
- Just temporarily,

1197
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:10,813
just until I get my own place.

1198
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:13,441
You lost the house.

1199
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:15,985
- No.
- Dad, how could you lose the house?

1200
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:18,029
I didn't lose the house.
I sold the house.

1201
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:20,656
I had a very good business opportunity
and I took it.

1202
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,700
I hope it's not shrimp.

1203
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:25,328
No, it's not. It's nothing fly-by-night.
I have a partner.

1204
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:27,455
I have a really good partner
who knows the ropes

1205
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,874
and I'm gonna be working
under them.

1206
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:37,215
Dad.

1207
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:48,476
"Since 1963"?

1208
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,978
Yeah, it gives us a sense of stability.
People like that.

1209
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:52,814
But it's a lie.

1210
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:55,775
It's a business lie.
It's different from a life lie.

1211
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,194
Okay.

1212
01:25:58,278 --> 01:26:00,696
I can live with that.

1213
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:02,657
You'll be the boss.

1214
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,075
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1215
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,998
