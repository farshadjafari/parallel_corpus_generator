You get down here

out of my shop

176
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,578
or I'll throw it

to it 'till tonight for me, Trace?

327

Or maybe bloody both!
So, what do I do?

331
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,537
Can I send them off
to a rich family overseas?

332
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:01,955
No.

333
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,791

to smooth it over.

337
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,342

Get it, sign the check.

338

00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:39,326
Oh, I've had enough.

347
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,292
Happy fucking birthday, Ray.

348
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:54,466
Should I take it?

349
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:55,676
So you can be all in.

350
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,554
Yes, thank you.
That will be very nice.

351
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,141
I'm fine, thank you.

352
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,185
Okay, there you go.

353
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,023
Darling.

354
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,484
It's alright now.
Ray.

355
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,028
Thanks for the shoot.

356
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:19,241
Good night.

357
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,703
Ray.

358
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:27,791
I'm gonna bed.

359
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:38,677
"Trace, are we gonna fit
12 computers In here?"

360
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,345
Yeah, easily.

361
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:44,141
Yeah, good.
This is cool.

362
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:46,727
Fix the place up.
Make a bit of money.

363
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,563
And you can refinance
and buy me out.

364
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:53,066
What would you do?

365
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,986
Oh, I'll be up at businesses.
Other things I wanna do.

366
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,070
No, no, no.

367
00:28:57,154 --> 00:28:59,114
C'mon, Trace!
Why not?

368
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:01,408
You've been doing it for four years.

369
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:05,204
You're a bloody great manager.

370
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:14,588
You know, --it's bad luck for tears 
to fall in the ground of a new business.

371
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:17,049
Bullshit.

372
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:18,467
Just think about it, ey?

373
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:20,511
Yeah, right.

374
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:22,513
Thanks.

375
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,476
<i>The whales aren't believed
to be In any danger,</i>

376
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:31,772
<i>But National Parks will stand
In guard to ensure proper traffic</i>

377
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,690
<i>as well as whale watchers</i>

378
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:37,486
<i>give the mammals
plenty of room to move,</i>

379
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:43,784
You know, 
-you should have told your mom 
I was coming last night, prick.

380
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:47,079
<i>Stay In memory,</i>

381
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,791
Yeah, absolutely.

382
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,710
Give us a look at that fun, will you?

383
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:02,719
This is weird.

384
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,429
What?

385
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:12,896
I don't know. I just feel-

386
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,190
Seeing you again
we'll be more together.

387
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,443
What about this?

388
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,529
Did you speak to that guy?

389
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:22,114
Moss?

390
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:25,117
I told him we had 30 grand,
mate, and his eyes went like this.

391
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:30,664
C'mon, let's get out of here. 
I want you to take me somewhere, will you?

392
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:33,500
Ray, I can't drive like this.

393
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:36,253
What's wrong? 
You're worried you might have a crash?

394
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:45,512
Sorry.

395
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,709
Thanks, mate.

396
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:18,086
No worries.

397
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,005
Change those prices for me.

398
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:22,216
No worries.

399
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:23,467
You're alright?

400
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,469
Yeah. I've just got a bit of a cold.

401
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:28,680
I'll drop in, uh, 
later in the way. I'll give you a ring.

402
00:31:44,446 --> 00:31:45,906
Hello?

403
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,825
Tracy, it's me.

404
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,827
Jonny.

405
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:53,413
How did you get my number?

406
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:55,207
Ray.

407
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,377
Ray gave it to me.

408
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,920
It's hard.

409
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,048
It's hard being back.

410
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,592
It's harder than I thought.

411
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,929
Tracy, you're there?

412
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,724
I gotta go.

413
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:13,892
See ya.

414
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:16,186
Yeah-. Yeah, sure.

415
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,988
You're okay?

416
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,282
Yeah.

417
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,408
You're okay?

418
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,952
Yeah, just wanna get home.

419
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:56,310
And Jonny wouldn't speak.

420
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:59,146
He had just lost his parents.

421
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:02,274
A feeling
I will never forget.

422
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,026
As time goes on-

423
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,457
But Jonny has been
in Vancouver for four years.

424
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,627
He has been working
very hard.

425
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,671
And he has a new job here
in Sydney.

426
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,715
A stockbroker.

427
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:41,397
Today is 20 years
since I married June.

428
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:02,125
June, thank you.

429
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,467
I don't know, Lionel.

430
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:13,887
You've got to do something.
Never had to pay for it.

431
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:15,055
A straight price?

432
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,849
I never had to find it.

433
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:20,477
No, I won't stand up in front of a bunch 
of people and say that I was wrong,

434
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:24,147
that my life was wrong,
because it wasn't. It isn't.

435
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:28,402
I gotta strip for this
Salbutan and just wait.

436
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,028
Really?

437
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:32,489
Yeah, I'll be fine.
One week and I'm clean.

438
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:35,868
One week?
Yeah, right.

439
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,874
M'mmmm.

440
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:44,668
How good is that?

441
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,587
Yummy.

442
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,838
Aren't you having any?

443
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:49,464
No.

444
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,645
Jonny's back.

445
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:06,899
Eh?

446
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:10,777
How is he?

447
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,948
He's great.
He's clean.

448
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:16,116
He's a stockbroker.

449
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,289
Let him on the phone
in the morning.

450
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,086
Most stupid.

451
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:31,340
No.

452
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:34,301
No boyfriend causes such a commotion. 
What does that say?

453
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,429
It's okay.

454
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:40,098
Yeah.
Is it?

455
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,477
Yeah, it is.

456
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,314
It's great.

457
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:53,904
The look on your face
after you spoke to him.

458
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,697
And now it's beyond that.

459
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:58,617
I'd kill for that feeling.

460
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,414
You got your stuff?

461
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:09,837
Trace... I haven't been
to the beach for years

462
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:13,799
and what is all.
Like I'm on public.

463
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,347
I'll take you
to the beach.

464
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:27,396
You're my darling.

465
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:30,190
Eat something.

466
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:37,030
Bye-bye.

467
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:39,074
See you, darling.

468
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:03,223
Do you like trading?

469
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:05,767
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

470
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:09,021
It's fun playing with other
people's money, you know.

471
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:11,273
I'm impressed.

472
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:14,610
A car.
Mr. Cool C.

473
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:16,403
The car's me uncle's.

474
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:23,243
Tracy.

475
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:24,995
How you're going?

476
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,914
I'm good.
What are you doing?

477
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:28,207
Now?

478
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,501
Yes.

479
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:31,585
Nothing.

480
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:33,295
Do you-

481
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,297
Do you wanna meet up?

482
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:38,509
Yeah, we could meet
on the corner, you know.

483
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:40,052
I don't have a car.

484
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:43,931
I can, I can pick you up.

485
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:47,017
At 7: 00?

486
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,644
I'll take you
to the city.

487
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,771
This is a really
cool restaurant.

488
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,314
Yeah, right.

489
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,024
Alright.

490
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:56,527
Okay.
Bye.

491
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,080
Hey.

492
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:52,249
Hi.

493
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,384
You wanna drive?

494
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:04,970
Okay.

495
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:27,117
I've got to know
if this is the real sea

496
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:44,927
How are you going?

497
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:46,970
Good.

498
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:49,014
You look great.

499
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:55,854
You really changed
since I left.

500
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:03,278
Tracy, You know  I..
I didn't have a choice.

501
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:07,241
My uncle sent me away
and my bags were packed.

502
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:09,368
I had no time
to see anyone.

503
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:12,579
Four years.

504
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,249
Yeah.

505
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:21,421
Anyway, look at you.
You look great.

506
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:24,258
Yeah, 32.

507
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:27,678
Living home with my mom
and work in a video shop.

508
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:33,809
Do you think
if I'd stayed,

509
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:35,018
you'd be clean now?

510
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:40,899
Fuck knows
where we'd be.

511
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:46,822
Scarlet for me
and scarlet for you

512
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,294
What do you wanna eat?

513
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:03,380
I bet the food
is pretty good here.

514
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:07,384
Is that what you heard? Like
you read restaurant reviews.

515
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,345
Certain times I do, yeah.

516
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:14,141
Are you ready to order?

517
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,018
What'd you like?

518
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,732
Take your time.
I'll come back.

519
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:26,195
You're okay?

520
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:28,405
I don't wanna be here.
I'm wanna go.

521
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:31,158
Tracy.

522
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,826
No, I just
wanna go home, okay?

523
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:39,666
This is a bad idea.

524
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,751
Where are you going?

525
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:41,835
I'm going home.

526
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,045
Let me drive.

527
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:44,338
No, no, no.

528
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:45,964
Don't grab me!

529
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:48,717
Don't think
you can fucking... grab me.

530
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,802
Tracy, c'mon.

531
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:52,262
What am I doing here?

532
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,560
This is so easy for you!

533
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,687
Is it easy?

534
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,067
What do you reckon, huh?

535
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,620
I want to drive you home, okay?

536
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,628
<i>Mr. Bush spoke
to Mr. Howard</i>

537
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:28,882
<i>about getting at least
the understanding</i>

538
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:47,943
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

539
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:48,986
What?

540
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:52,656
Is that loaded?

541
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:56,326
Nah, it's my farewell present when
I sold the bar in the Philippines.

542
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:59,371
Some bastard tried to impress me.

543
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,874
I never used it.

544
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,751
It's beautifully handcrafted.

545
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:07,171
Why don't you keep it?
I'm retiring.

546
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:08,463
Oh, no.

547
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:09,798
No no no, I want you to have it.

548
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:12,759
I'm not a collector, mate.

549
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:14,803
Do you want a beer?
I poured you one.

550
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:16,430
No, I might keep going.

551
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:18,432
There's some white wine
in the fridge.

552
00:43:18,515 --> 00:43:21,185
Jenny's getting a bit jacked up  at me 
showing up late.

553
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:24,855
So, if there's nothing else,
I'll see you tomorrow.

554
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:26,398
Yeah, alright.

555
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,816
At 10: 00?

556
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,401
Sure.

557
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:31,695
Hey,

558
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:33,739
what ever happened
to that Barky couple

559
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:36,325
who ran the speed factory for us?

560
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:38,327
Merv and Eileen.

561
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,079
Where did they go?

562
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:43,373
Kangaroo Valley, I think.

563
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,083
They've got some goats up there.

564
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,794
Goats.

565
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:52,007
I just wanna get things finalized.

566
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,009
Lawyer's on the case.
You understand?

567
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:56,261
Yeah, yeah, sure.

568
00:43:56,345 --> 00:43:57,596
Steven,

569
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:59,515
just sit down for a minute, will you?

570
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:01,892
I know you wanna get back
to your family.

571
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:11,568
Come.

572
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:15,864
I know some things about me
that you found... difficult.

573
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,493
I wanna say this.

574
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:21,995
I know what sort of man you are,

575
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:24,957
and your thoughts about such
matters won't make things-

576
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,917
I'm not one to judge, mate.

577
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,255
I just wanna...
thank you for your trust and discretion.

578
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:34,508
Okay.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

579
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,093
Yeah, alright.

580
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:39,429
Right.

581
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:41,181
Okay.

582
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:45,811
Bradly's got no idea.

583
00:44:45,894 --> 00:44:48,772
He hasn't been down to
the speed factory in years.

584
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:51,483
He just wants to fuck boys
and play golf.

585
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:53,193
What if he goes down there?

586
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:54,903
Well, then he does.

587
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,531
Merv and Eileen can deal with it. 
Honestly, Stevy.

588
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:01,827
I hurt my nose!

589
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:02,911
Is there any blood?

590
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:06,290
Is she alright?

591
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:07,833
Just a little bit.

592
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,877
My bunny, my bunny.

593
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:12,588
Oh, that's alright
'cause we've got him now!

594
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:16,592
We silly duffers.
These toys are shit.

595
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:18,927
Bloody dangerous, too.

596
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:21,263
You know, Tiny and Jean
have got a new floor.

597
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:23,348
You can just lay
straight over the slab.

598
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:24,892
Yeah? Good.

599
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:27,644
Here we go. It's okay, it's okay, honey. 
There you go.

600
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:29,938
Sh, sh, sh,
There.

601
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,940
There we go.

602
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:35,903
So, this is what we're doing.

603
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:39,239
So, we can save for a whole
new floor and we can have it.

604
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:41,450
It's worth it.

605
00:45:41,492 --> 00:45:44,661
Yeah.

606
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:48,248

[voice from TV]<i>Move along the outside,
Now Springsfur is pushing up,</i>

607
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:51,043
<i>And now Camel has dropped

608
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:54,880
<i>Springsfur by four,

609
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:21,156
(Janelle)"Tracy, you're brother's here,
C'mon, please,"

610
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:42,010
He's not here.

611
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:44,388
Having a good perv?

612
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,348
You're losing your touch.

613
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:53,522
Why didn't you wake me?
I missed my swim.

614
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:56,358
I did try to wake you, 
but if my memory says me correctly

615
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:58,110
you told me to fuck off, mum.

616
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:00,070
Sorry.

617
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:02,614
Mum, just drop her off here.
She can get the train.

618
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:04,491
(Tracy) I'm late.

619
00:47:04,575 --> 00:47:06,785
Here's the station, Trace.

620
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:18,297
Where're you going, anyway?

621
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,424
I don't know.
It's a surprise.

622
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:23,093
Yeah, it's just somewhere
never you mind.

623
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:27,598
I am go right here.
Mum, mum? Go.

624
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:30,225
Oh, don't.
Stop it, for goodness sake!

625
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:32,895
We're going to take forever
to get back on the freeway.

626
00:47:32,978 --> 00:47:36,273
I'll take Tracy to work.
Laura picks her up, right?

627
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:38,942
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

628
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,821
Mum?
Just wait, please.

629
00:47:43,905 --> 00:47:46,324
Trace!

630
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,747
Did you go out
with Jonny last night?

631
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,665
Yeah.

632
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,086
Okay.

633
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:00,631
Hey, mom?

634
00:48:02,883 --> 00:48:04,343
Give us a kiss.

635
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:12,434
Oh, no, no, no!
Naughty girl!

636
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:14,436
Like the lesbians?

637
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,729
You have a good day.

638
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:23,403
Could you not clap lesbian-

639
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:42,798
[Laura] Doesn't it go in the Ts?

640
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:44,508
No.

641
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:46,426
I'll look for it Ivonne
as a customer.

642
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,053
Would you?

643
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,473
When do you find out about the bank?

644
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:54,726
This afternoon.

645
00:48:56,645 --> 00:49:00,190
You told Janelle you got
the loan approved already.

646
00:49:00,274 --> 00:49:01,942
Yeah.

647
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:03,902
Did you tell her
anything different?

648
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:05,654
No!

649
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,618
The party's right here.
It's right here!

650
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,454
Are you alright?

651
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:15,622
Yeah.

652
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:18,125
Just I didn't sleep much last night.

653
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:20,752
You're racing or you just watching some TV?

654
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:26,383
I went out with Jonny.

655
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:30,345
Are you alright?

656
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:31,722
It's a change.

657
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:34,183
Didn't you and Janelle
have a chitty chat about that?

658
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:35,809
Tracy.

659
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:41,106
Lionel Dawson. Okay, I can buy that. 
He's an old friend.

660
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,900
Do you think this is okay?

661
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:46,904
He's straight.
Straighter than you.

662
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:49,031
Do you feel okay
about being around him?

663
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:51,116
I can handle it.

664
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:54,244
You don't know him!

665
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:56,371
No, I don't.

666
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,960
He's a stockbroker.

667
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:06,340
Went to this really nice restaurant 
in the city.

668
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,428
What?

669
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,515
You look scared. 
I haven't seen that look for a while.

670
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:17,309
There's this big fucking empty space.

671
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:18,519
Tracy, it's okay.

672
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:20,020
I'm fucking fine.

673
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:21,271
Take it easy.

674
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,571
<i>Brad, It's Lionel,</i>

675
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:33,534
<i>If you're there, mate, please pick
up, I really need to talk to you,</i>

676
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:35,869
<i>Brad, It's Lionel again,</i>

677
00:50:35,953 --> 00:50:38,997
<i>Please, call me, mate,
Okay?</i>

678
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:41,750
(Steve) It's the third time today.

679
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:49,466
Your wife's outside.

680
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:54,221
She's got a key.

681
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:00,269
Look at these fucking boxes.

682
00:51:00,352 --> 00:51:02,479
There are people waiting.

683
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:05,732
Can I stay today?
Please?

684
00:51:10,988 --> 00:51:12,698
If you want to arrange this,

685
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:15,701
you talk to me.

686
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:18,245
'Cause I fucking live here,
not her.

687
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:19,997
I co-owned, Bradley.

688
00:51:20,038 --> 00:51:21,707
C'mon, Steven.

689
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:24,251
You fucking prick.

690
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:27,379
(Janelle) <i>Do you know
whose house Is this?</i>

691
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:30,174

(Ray) <i>Bradley Thompson's,
What?</i>

692
00:51:30,257 --> 00:51:32,342
Don't you want to have
a look inside?

693
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:33,760
Ray!

694
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:36,763
It's open for inspection, mom!
Look, anyone can go in.

695
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:40,100
How did you find out
about it?

696
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:43,520
I just ready it in the paper. C'mon.

697
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:28,273
<i>Hi, my name Is Tracy Heart, I had
an appointment with Donna Suvani,</i>

698
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:33,987
It's just that I need to secure
the loan as soon as possible.

699
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,282
No.

700
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:39,159
Okay.
No, that's great.

701
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:41,703
Yeah, yeah. I'll be there. Thank you.

702
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:43,580
Excuse me.

703
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:46,834
I've gotta close the shop.
Do you want anything?

704
00:52:50,587 --> 00:52:53,465
I'm gonna get change.
I'll be two minutes.

705
00:52:58,303 --> 00:53:00,097
It's Trace.

706
00:53:07,896 --> 00:53:10,065
Oh, honey, I forgot
how painful this is.

707
00:53:10,149 --> 00:53:12,693
It's fucking horrible.

708
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:17,531
I'll be back
in a couple of hours, alright?

709
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:26,582
I call Brad so many times but he
hasn't called back. I don't understand.

710
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:29,668
Sorry, Lionel, but I gotta go.

711
00:53:31,587 --> 00:53:33,589
I'll be back really soon, alright?

712
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:35,299
Okay.

713
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:46,185
Hi. I'm here to see Donna Suvani.

714
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:48,437
M'h-hm. Take a seat.

715
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:05,662
(Ray) Yeah, it's alright.
It's about half an hour trip.

716
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:08,373
Hi, Jonny. Steven Moss.
Steven, this is Jonny Nguyen.

717
00:54:08,457 --> 00:54:09,458
How are ya?

718
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:11,168
Good, good, good.

719
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:15,422
(Jonny) I'm sorry, excuse me.

720

00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:24,019

[mobile phone rings]

720
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:26,558
Hi.

721
00:54:26,642 --> 00:54:28,894
(Tracy)<i>Where are you?</i>

722
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:32,105
With some friends at
the club. Where are you?

723
00:54:32,189 --> 00:54:36,610
I'm just sorting out some-
Finishing up the bank stuff.

724
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:40,823
It's kind of hard for me
to talk right now.

725
00:54:40,906 --> 00:54:42,074
Sure, sorry.

726
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:44,201
No, that's fine.

727
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:47,704
It's great you called.

728
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:50,958
I missed you.

729
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:53,502
I just, I wanted to say
that last night-

730
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:55,671
Tracy, listen,
I'll call you.

731
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:58,090
Okay?
I have to finish here.

732
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:02,177
(receptionist) Excuse me.
You can go in now.

733
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:03,303
I've gotta go.

734
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:09,685

(Donna) G'day, Tracy.

735
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:11,937
How are you?

736
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,939
Sit down.
Wait me a second.

737
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,529
Bloody computers.

738
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:23,323
He's cute.

739
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,534
You want kids?

740
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:27,452
Don't know.

741
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:31,331
I've got a friend who's having
a second baby.

742
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:33,750
Really?
He's nice.

743
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,669
A lot of work.

744
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:38,297
Have you got a boyfriend?

745
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,299
Would it help the loan if I did?

746
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:44,261
Maybe.

747
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:45,804
Okay.

748
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:48,140
Now, the business loan.

749
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:51,143
I'm really sorry, Tracy,
but there's no way

750
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:54,813
I can approve this loan
for you today.

751
00:55:54,855 --> 00:55:56,815
I think you probably
know why.

752
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,443
Okay.

753
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:01,653
But what if I reduce
the amount a little bit?

754
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:05,657
Instead of making it
40 thousand I made it 25.

755
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:10,078
The business is great but it's a lease
premises. There's no real capital.

756
00:56:10,162 --> 00:56:13,332
If the bank did have to come in,
there'll be nothing to recoup on it.

757
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:15,876
The capital'll be built
into the new shop.

758
00:56:15,918 --> 00:56:18,212
The computers, the stock,
the customer base.

759
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:22,216
Tracy, is there someone you
can get to help you out with it?

760
00:56:22,257 --> 00:56:24,218
Maybe get your dad
to go guarantor.

761
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:27,221
That's not gonna happen. I'm
not asking for a gift here.

762
00:56:27,304 --> 00:56:29,223
I'll be paying it back.

763
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:31,058
Tracy, we did a credit check
on you.

764
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:33,852
I'm paying it off.
I've organized it.

765
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:36,188
Di-di-
I'm paying it off!

766
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:39,858
Look here. "Have you been refused
credits in the last ten years?"

767
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:42,528
You ticked the box No
when you should've ticked Yes.

768
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,863
No one ticks Yes.
It just meant fucking no!

769
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:49,117
You think by ticking No when you should've
ticked Yes is not gonna count against you?

770
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:51,078
We do check
these things here, Tracy.

771
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,248
We know that you've been
charged with credit card fraud.

772
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:59,670
So this bank has never
lent money to criminals?

773
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:03,048
Okay, this is impolite. I think
we should just take a deep breath.

774
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,426
Yeah. Well, sorry to be taking
up your precious fucking time!

775
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:22,151

[Steven] Is it good?

776
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:25,612
Good.

777
00:57:25,696 --> 00:57:27,364
Okay.

778
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:28,657
Alright.

779
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,909
Good to meet you.

780
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:35,414
Hey, Ray.

781
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:42,504
What were you doing
this morning?

782
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:44,381
I saw you
on the street, idiot.

783
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:45,841
Open for inspection, mate.

784
00:57:45,924 --> 00:57:48,135
We're good.
We're good.

785
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:55,184
Any reason you're useful is you're a
fucking speck a thousand miles from anyone.

786
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:58,312
If by accident we do meet,
you look straight through me

787
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:02,149
and I'll do likewise.
Yeh?

788
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:05,444
Yeh, yeh, sure.
Whatever.

789
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:10,866
We're still home.

790
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:54,993
I'll get you
a cup of tea.

791
00:59:13,762 --> 00:59:18,016
I can't do this.

792
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:19,560
It's so fucking ugly.

793
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:21,228
I'm calling an ambulance.

794
00:59:21,311 --> 00:59:23,772
No, I don't want
an ambulance, Tracy.

795
00:59:23,856 --> 00:59:25,899
What do you want?

796
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:29,236
The paid stuff.
In there!

797
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:40,205
I'm sorry, Trace.

798
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:41,874
It's alright.

799
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:43,417
I fucking stink.

800
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:45,711
Don't worry about it.

801
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:58,098
How many times
do you do this?

802
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,183
Four.

803
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:01,435
Four. Fuck!

804
01:00:01,477 --> 01:00:03,061
Is it worth it?

805
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:07,441
In reality bull fucking shit.

806
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,776
Lionel, if you can't get it
for free anymore,

807
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:13,572
your life is gonna get
fucked up really fast.

808
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:16,450
Just gotta be strong.

809
01:00:16,492 --> 01:00:17,951
Tracy, shush.

810
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:20,412
Sorry.

811
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:22,122
No, Trace.

812
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:23,832
I went saw Janelle.

813
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:29,087
She hates me.
She still hates me.

814
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:32,424
I'm no good, you know.

815
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:35,886
Turned everything to shit.
Janelle, you.

816
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:37,346
You've no fucking idea.

817
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:40,224
Mom's life was up to shit
before she met you.

818
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:45,687
We were going out to Chinese
restaurants with Lionel Dawson.

819
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:50,692
Going down the beach with
fucking Lionel fucking Dawson!

820
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:53,362
Then when we went out,
we came home in taxis!

821
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:56,156
So we were famous, too.

822
01:00:58,158 --> 01:01:00,619
Mom!

823
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:03,956
Mom went, we went fucking
mad. We didn't know anyone.

824
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:07,000
This was like
a fucking game.

825
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:09,503
No, no.
God!

826
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:12,840
It's 'cause you loved us.

827
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:15,592
Alright? You fucking loved us
and you didn't have to.

828
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:24,601
I loved both of them.
You know I loved them both

829
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:27,771
and they're both fucking gone
for me. Your mum and Brad.

830
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:31,817
I really thought that I'd
get a happy-ever-after.

831
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,445
I didn't-
Honestly, Trace, I-

832
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:37,906
I never thought this-

833
01:01:41,618 --> 01:01:46,748
Trace, I'm fucking scared. I can't go
through another air of this, you know, please.

834
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:49,626
Darling, there's money
in the wardrobe, ey?

835
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:53,213
Please, darling, ey?

836
01:01:53,255 --> 01:01:54,715
Look, I'm sorry.

837
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:57,926
You know,
you know!

838
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:01,930
I can't school for you, Lionel.

839
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:06,560
Fuck!

840
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:09,229
How could you
even ask me to?

841
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:11,565
'Cause there's no one else
that fucking has.

842
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:14,902
There's fucking no one.
There's fucking no one!

843
01:02:40,219 --> 01:02:43,388
Tracy, what the fuck
you've been doing?

844
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:46,141
It's not for me.

845
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:48,519
So, how much do you want?

846
01:02:48,602 --> 01:02:51,438
Three Gs.

847
01:02:52,356 --> 01:02:55,150
Yeah, I can do it.

848
01:02:55,234 --> 01:02:57,027
You call this number
in ten minutes.

849
01:03:12,918 --> 01:03:14,294
You have
the correct money?

850
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:16,797
Yeah.

851
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,966
Alright?

852
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:30,644
Excuse me.
Is there a toilet in there?

853
01:03:30,686 --> 01:03:32,062
Yeah, in that door.

01:21:23,926 --> 01:21:26,970
I am fucked!

1046
01:21:27,054 --> 01:21:29,431
It's just this
one time for me.

1047
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:32,643
Look at me.

1048
01:21:35,187 --> 01:21:37,940
We do this with Ray together.

1049
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:40,442
We can get
what we want.

1050
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:02,756
I can't get the loan, mom.

1051
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:08,679
Does it mean no?

1052
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:18,772
Is it so bad? I mean,
you still got your job.

1053
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:22,860
You're the manager.
That's quite an achievement.

1054
01:22:22,943 --> 01:22:25,070
I don't want
to just have a job!

1055
01:22:25,112 --> 01:22:28,532
Four years I've been
working in that place!

1056
01:22:30,617 --> 01:22:34,246
Turning up on time. Spending
hours chained up in there.

1057
01:22:40,252 --> 01:22:42,629
What do you want, Tracy?

1058
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:49,636
I wanna turn up on Monday

1059
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:52,973
with enough cash to be
an owner of that business.

1060
01:22:56,643 --> 01:22:57,895
What else?

1061
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:06,069
When Jonny was here
the other night,

1062
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:10,032
shit, I gave him
a hard time.

1063
01:23:10,115 --> 01:23:13,327
And I thought to myself afterwards,
"Where did that come from?"

1064
01:23:15,412 --> 01:23:18,957
I haven't seen you these last
few days since he's been back.

1065
01:23:22,628 --> 01:23:25,088
Mom!

1066
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:28,884
I see a bit
of my little girl back.

1067
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:33,138
Yeah.

1068
01:23:33,222 --> 01:23:35,599
Well, it's not that easy, mom.
I mean, you know.

1069
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:38,685
No, it's not.

1070
01:23:49,321 --> 01:23:51,323
You would've done
something different

1071
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:53,700
if you could've,
wouldn't you?

1072
01:23:55,285 --> 01:23:57,621
You would've changed
thing for you?

1073
01:23:57,704 --> 01:23:59,832
Of course.

1074
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:07,714
Trace, it's your life.
Darling, it's no one else's.

1075
01:24:48,213 --> 01:24:49,381
Got your card?

1076
01:24:49,465 --> 01:24:51,049
Yeah.

1077
01:24:55,971 --> 01:25:00,517
You've got $15 in overdue.
Do you want to fix it a month?

1078
01:25:00,601 --> 01:25:03,228
Would you pay a couple
of dollars off it today?

1079
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:05,856
Alright.

1080
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:07,858
This guy
will fix it.

1081
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:10,277
Thanks for this.

1082
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,029
No worries
I need the money.

1083
01:25:12,112 --> 01:25:13,530
How much is here?

1084
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:15,365
Eight.

1085
01:25:16,492 --> 01:25:17,993
So, do you bring it back?

1086
01:25:18,076 --> 01:25:19,786
Yeah, we got a buyer.

1087
01:25:22,581 --> 01:25:23,790
How far out is it?

1088
01:25:23,874 --> 01:25:26,877
A couple of hours.
South.

1089
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,632
Okay, I'm coming with you.

1090
01:25:33,467 --> 01:25:34,551
No, she's not.

1091
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:40,724
I go where that money goes.

1092
01:25:40,808 --> 01:25:42,434
Fuck!

1093
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:49,483

(woman) <i>Okay, Tania, It's discussed
If we don't reach the reserve,</i>

1094
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:52,736
(Tania) You talk to him.
You handle all the negotiations.

1095
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:54,154
I can't go there today.

1096
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:58,367
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

1097
01:25:59,785 --> 01:26:02,663
Oh, this is very exciting.

1098
01:26:10,337 --> 01:26:13,090
Uh!

1099
01:26:13,173 --> 01:26:14,675
What did you do that for?

1100
01:26:14,758 --> 01:26:17,219
'Cause you're here
and you fucking shouldn't be.

1101
01:26:17,302 --> 01:26:19,388
Fucking hurt my head.
Is it bleeding?

1102
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:22,599
Why are you in my house?

1103
01:26:22,683 --> 01:26:24,143
It was a fucking shit week.

1104
01:26:24,226 --> 01:26:27,229
I've heard from credible
sources that you aren't retiring.

1105
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:31,233
That makes you
a full blind prick, you know.

1106
01:26:31,316 --> 01:26:32,693
Say it again.

1107
01:26:32,776 --> 01:26:35,112
You heard me.

1108
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:43,829
Lionel, who told you
I wasn't retiring?

1109
01:26:46,665 --> 01:26:49,168
You should talk to Steven.

1110
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:54,965
Alright.

1111
01:26:55,048 --> 01:26:58,635
Let's have a look at that.
That's alright.

1112
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:01,013
I kind of liked it.

1113
01:27:21,742 --> 01:27:24,786
Come with me.
I'll sort you out.

1114
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:09,790
Steven, If I drive down
to my place at Milton,

1115
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:12,167
what am I gonna find there?

1116
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:14,294
Don't know. I haven't
been there in years.

1117
01:28:14,378 --> 01:28:16,296
Well, they asked me.

1118
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:19,007
(Jenny) Hey, hello!
Long time.

1119
01:28:19,091 --> 01:28:20,843
Hi, Jenny.

1120
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,012
Meet you at mom's?

1121
01:28:24,096 --> 01:28:25,305
Yeah, it'll be alright.

1122
01:28:25,389 --> 01:28:27,307
Hello, darling.

1123
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:28,892
(Jenny) I'll brush your hair.

1124
01:28:28,976 --> 01:28:31,645
Good to see you, Brad. Lionel.

1125
01:28:34,148 --> 01:28:36,150
(Brad) That stuff alone?

1126
01:28:36,191 --> 01:28:38,235
(Lionel) Yeah, four, please.

1127
01:28:40,154 --> 01:28:41,238
See ya.

1128
01:28:41,321 --> 01:28:44,366
I own that place.
It's in my name.

1129
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:47,161
I know that. Look...you
believe this old junkie?

1130
01:28:47,244 --> 01:28:48,579
This is what he wanted.

1131
01:28:48,662 --> 01:28:51,748
His name is Lionel Dawson.

1132
01:28:51,832 --> 01:28:54,543
He has done things
and been in situations

1133
01:28:54,626 --> 01:28:56,461
you can only dream of.

1134
01:28:56,545 --> 01:28:58,422
He's one of the greats,
you prick!

1135
01:28:58,505 --> 01:29:01,008
Steven, c'mon!
Fuck.

1136
01:29:02,342 --> 01:29:04,636
You can't smoke
in here, mate.

1137
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:16,773
(Lionel) This is nice, ey.

1138
01:29:16,857 --> 01:29:18,192
Yes, it's very nice.

1139
01:29:20,944 --> 01:29:24,990
Steven... I know
how much you earn.

1140
01:29:25,073 --> 01:29:27,576
I know how much
your fucking mortgage is.

1141
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:29,953
You tell me everything,
you bloody idiot.

1142
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,624
This is all new!

1143
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:38,045
Lionel, wait in the car, will you?

1144
01:29:42,424 --> 01:29:44,593
(Brad) Just tell me the truth.

1145
01:29:44,676 --> 01:29:47,429
What have you been doing

1146
01:29:47,513 --> 01:29:49,681
under my name
behind my fucking back?

1147
01:29:52,976 --> 01:29:55,229
One finial call.

1148
01:29:56,897 --> 01:30:00,025
I'll find out.

1149
01:30:00,067 --> 01:30:03,654
You are in such... shit.

1150
01:30:03,737 --> 01:30:06,406
He's the one you have
to worry about, Bradley.

1151
01:30:08,242 --> 01:30:10,410
This feeling
you've got now,

1152
01:30:10,494 --> 01:30:14,122
this worry,
this terror,

1153
01:30:14,206 --> 01:30:15,707
I never had that.

1154
01:30:19,086 --> 01:30:21,588
You're in trouble now.

1155
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:25,092
I can smell it
coming off you.

1156
01:30:29,847 --> 01:30:31,390
Will you drive, Lionel?

1157
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:33,058
Alright.

1158
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:34,643
Drive the car.

1159
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:35,727
Yeah, sure.

1160
01:30:35,769 --> 01:30:37,521
I'm gonna fucking
sort this out.

1161
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:39,898
I need some information.

1162
01:30:53,662 --> 01:30:56,957

(Janelle)<i>Lionel, are you there?</i>

1163
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:19,855
These are okay?

1164
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:21,648
(Ray) Ey?

1165
01:31:25,986 --> 01:31:27,112
Thanks.

1166
01:31:45,214 --> 01:31:46,882
What's going on there?

1167
01:31:50,677 --> 01:31:51,887
C'mon, Trace.

1168
01:31:54,056 --> 01:31:56,225
You know how to love
someone.

1169
01:31:56,308 --> 01:31:57,726
Just fucking dive in.

1170
01:32:46,108 --> 01:32:48,068
What put you down
with the place, Brad?

1171
01:32:50,154 --> 01:32:53,282
Steven fucking Moss.
That fuck.

1172
01:32:56,618 --> 01:32:59,454
I fucking warned him.

1173
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:03,333
Come on.

1174
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:06,086
A cup of tea, ey?

1175
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:10,757
I'd like
just to clear that quickly.

1176
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:13,343
We passed him
on the road.

1177
01:33:15,721 --> 01:33:16,930
What's wrong with you?

1178
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:19,099
Nothing.

1179
01:33:19,183 --> 01:33:20,934
What about that shit
I got you?

1180
01:33:23,353 --> 01:33:25,147
I'm not gonna get on.

1181
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:34,740
Maybe when I'm clean
we can build a house here, ey?

1182
01:33:34,781 --> 01:33:38,785
Lionel is a fuck physique.

1183
01:33:38,869 --> 01:33:41,371
Yeah, but you know
what you said to Steven.

1184
01:33:41,455 --> 01:33:44,041
Like you said
I've been in situations.

1185
01:33:45,042 --> 01:33:47,961
You know,
you said I was great.

1186
01:33:50,297 --> 01:33:53,342
I love you, Brad.
I miss you.

1187
01:33:54,384 --> 01:33:57,262
Anything you ever loved
is this.

1188
01:33:57,304 --> 01:34:00,224
That's not the fucking true.

1189
01:34:00,307 --> 01:34:02,267
Listen to me, Lionel,

1190
01:34:05,062 --> 01:34:07,856
it's this Ray Heart.
Do you know him?

1191
01:34:08,982 --> 01:34:10,567
No, no.

1192
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:12,694
How much is the truth?

1193
01:34:14,988 --> 01:34:16,782
I don't know him, seriously.

1194
01:34:16,865 --> 01:34:18,867
You're a fucking liar.

1195
01:34:18,951 --> 01:34:20,160
That's not true.

1196
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:24,998
Don't.

1197
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:28,377
Not you, Brad.
Please.

1198
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:30,754
There are things
I can explain.

1199
01:34:30,838 --> 01:34:34,049
You are a fucking
lying junkie cunt.

1200
01:34:36,093 --> 01:34:37,928
You've caused me nothing
but trouble.

1201
01:34:38,011 --> 01:34:39,680
Don't be hard
with me.

1202
01:34:39,763 --> 01:34:41,932
Fuck.

1203
01:34:42,015 --> 01:34:45,185
It's over, Lionel.
It's fucking over.

1204
01:34:48,564 --> 01:34:50,732
You stay there.

1205
01:34:53,485 --> 01:34:55,737
Don't come
anywhere near me.

1206
01:35:04,705 --> 01:35:06,665
Just sit there.

1207
01:35:13,255 --> 01:35:15,466
I'm tired.

1208
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:18,969
Just stay there, Lionel.

1209
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:21,138
Yeah, okay, Brad.

1209
