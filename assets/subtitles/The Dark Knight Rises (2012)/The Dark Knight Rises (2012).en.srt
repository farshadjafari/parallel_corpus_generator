It's about that night. This night,
eight years ago. The night Dent died.

164

The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.

165
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,477
He murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams...

166
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,394
...breaks Dent's neck
and then just vanishes?

167

You haven't been down here in a long time.

176
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,549
Trying to find out more about
our jewel thief. I ran her prints.

177
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,513
Unless she's lost a lot of weight...

178
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,142
...she was wearing
someone else's fingerprints.

179

She's good.

180
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,143
She may be, but we have a trace
on the necklace.

181
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,933
We do. I cross-referenced the address
she went back to...

182
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,695
...with police data
on high-end B-and-E's, and, um...

183
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,939
Selina Kyle.

184
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,953
The databases are full of close-calls,
tips from fences.

185
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,116
She's good, but the ground
is shrinking beneath her feet.

186
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,035
We should send the police
before she fences the pearls.

187
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,420
She won't. She likes them too much.

188
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,377
And they weren't what she was after.

189
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,633
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

190
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,795
It was printer toner
mixed with graphite on the safe.

191
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,555
It gives a good pull and it's untraceable.

192
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,558
Fascinating. You two should
exchange notes over coffee.

193

You're trying to set me
up with a jewel thief?

194
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:14,649
At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee,
if it brought you back to the world.

195

And that's the problem.

197

You hung up your cape and your cowl
but you didn't move on.

198

You never went to find a life.
To find someone.

But that's all part of living, sir.

203
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,330
But you're not living, you're just waiting,
hoping for things to go bad again.

204
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,005
Remember when you left Gotham?

205
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,168
Before all this, before Batman?

206
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,965
You were gone seven year.

207
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,724
Seven years I waited,
hoping that you wouldn't come back.

208
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,512
Every year, I took a holiday.
I went to Florence.

on the banks of the Arno.</i>

210
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,350
Every fine evening I'd sit there
and order a Fernet Branca.

211
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,403
I had this fantasy...

212
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,195
...that I would look across the tables...

213
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,327

<i>Maybe a couple of kids.</i>

215
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,286
You wouldn't say anything to me,
nor me to you.

216
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,299
But we'd both know that you'd made it.

217
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,801
That you were happy.

218
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,392
I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.

219
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:36,057
I always knew there was nothing here
for you, except pain and tragedy.

220
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,101
And I wanted something
more for you than that.

325
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,516
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
unscheduled calls.

326
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,472
Even from a police officer.

327
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,310
And if I go get a warrant for
the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder?

328
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,691

Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

331
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,700
He chased a gunman
down into the sewers.

332
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,207
When I pulled him out, he was babbling
about an underground army.

333
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,209
A masked man called Bane.

334
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,379
Shouldn't you be telling
your superior officers?

335
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,633
They asked me if he saw
any giant alligators.

336
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,801
He needs you.

337
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,675
He needs the Batman.

338
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:16,222
- If Commissioner Gordon thinks...
- Oh, he doesn't know or care who you are.

339
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,978
But we've met before.

340
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:24,227
It was a long time ago. I was a kid.
Uh, St. Swithin's.

341
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,614
It used to be funded by
the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage.

342
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:33,695
My mom died when I was small. It was
a car accident, I don't really remember it.

343
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,496
But my dad got shot a couple years later
over a gambling debt...

344
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,995
...and I remember that one just fine.

345
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,253
Not a lot of people know
what it feels like, do they?

346
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,376
To be angry...

347
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,970
...in your bones.

348
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,679
I mean, they understand.

349
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,681
Foster parents.

350
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,846
Everybody understands...

351
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,640
...for a while.

352
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,111
And then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do.

353
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,778
Move on.

354
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,322
So after a while,
they stop understanding.

355
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,358
They send the angry kid to a boys' home.

356
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,534
I figured it out too late.
You gotta learn to hide the anger.

357
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,582
Practice smiling in a mirror.

358
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,911
It's like putting on a mask.

359
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,712
So you showed up this one day,
in a cool car.

360
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,717
Pretty girl on your arm.

361
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,591
We were so excited.

362
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,473
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan.

363
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:40,679
I mean, we used to make up stories
about you, man. Legends.

364
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,644
And, you know, with the other kids,
that's all it was, just stories, but...

365
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,519
Right when I saw you,
I knew who you really were.

366
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,777
I'd seen that look on your face before.

367
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,943
It's the same one I taught myself.

368
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,782
I don't know why you took the fall
for Dent's murder...

369
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,705
...but I'm still a
believer in the Batman...

370
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,207
...even if you're not.

371
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:13,841
Why did you say that your boys' home used
to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?

372
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,754
<font color="#808080">BLAKE:</font>
Because the money stopped.

374

- Yeah.

381
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:51,799
Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation
stop funding boys' homes in the city?

382
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:57,054
The foundation is funded by
the profits of Wayne Enterprises.

383
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,926
There have to be some.

384
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:02,434
- Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
- I'll get him on the phone.

385
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,597
No, no, no. Do we still have
any cars around the place?

386
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,640
Yes. One or two.

387
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,809
I need an appointment at the hospital
for my leg.

388
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,729

WAYNE:</font> That's good.

390
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,572
No. That's because there is
no cartilage in your knee.

391
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,084
And not much of any use
in your elbows or your shoulders.

Between that and the scar tissue
on your kidneys...

to your brain tissue...

of your body...

- Right.

396
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,355

But they do know that once he did...

550

...he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul,
your mentor.

551
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,081
Bane was a member
of the League of Shadows?

552

And then he was excommunicated.

553

for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.

I didn't realize I was known
for trifling with criminals.

no true despair without hope.

1045
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,839
So as I terrorize Gotham...

1046

Mr. Fox, would you like to brief
the captain?

1434
01:51:16,184 --> 01:51:18,778
Miss Tate's fully aware of the situation.

1435
01:51:18,937 --> 01:51:23,408
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

1436
01:51:23,567 --> 01:51:25,569
- Why?
- We built it.

1437
01:51:25,735 --> 01:51:27,237
You built the bomb?

1438
01:51:27,404 --> 01:51:31,580
It was built as a fusion reactor.
First of its kind.

1439
01:51:31,741 --> 01:51:35,120
Bane turned the core into a bomb
and removed it from the reactor.

1440
01:51:35,287 --> 01:51:38,666
- Here's the important part.
- As the device's fuel cells deteriorate...

1441
01:51:38,832 --> 01:51:40,755
...it becomes increasingly unstable...

1442
01:51:40,917 --> 01:51:42,464
...to the point of detonation.

1443
01:51:42,627 --> 01:51:44,379
This bomb is a time bomb.

1444
01:51:44,546 --> 01:51:48,551
And it will go off in 23 days,
regardless of Bane's revolution...

1445
01:51:48,717 --> 01:51:51,436
...or what we, or the outside world,
choose to do.

1446
01:51:51,595 --> 01:51:54,189
So your plan might not be
as practical as you thought.

1447
01:51:54,723 --> 01:51:59,194
- Could you disarm it?
- I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

1448
01:51:59,352 --> 01:52:02,481
- Let's move from this location and call it in.
- Right. Let's go.
