Miles Slade, the crazy Texan kid.

159
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,347
An outside bet,

160
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,646
but he's mad enough
to rise the ranks.

161
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,845
Reckless, ruthless, wild,

162
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,013
but guaranteed great entertainment.

This is one guy
who truly loves his job.

164
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,361
And if you thought
it couldn't get any better,

165
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,193
we have a dramatic late entrant--

166
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,791
a returning champion
who I'm sure

167
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,964
will add something very
personal to the proceedings.

168

Seven years ago,

172
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,136
For one reason,
and one reason only--

173
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,176
revenge.

174
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,713
Joshua's wife was brutally murdered

175
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,583
in their Miami home
four months ago,

176
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,150
and the person who killed her

177
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,214
is one of this year's players!

00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,888

As ever, each assassin

186
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,177
is implanted with a tracking device,

187
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,509
so we can find them,

188
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,311
and they can find each other.

189
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,218
But this year we've added
an extra pinch of spice.

190

our contestants will discover

192

193
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,927
isn't just a tracking device.

Besides, somebody upstairs
has designs on her.

what I'm talking about, do you?

368
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,069
You really are a priest.

369
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,729
Father Macavoy.

370
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:21,309
This is--
was my church.

371
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,407
Well, Father,
welcome to the Tournament.

372
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,618
Thank you.

373
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,889

[cheers and applause]

375
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,153
They found the blip.

376
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,161
What is it?

377
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,663
It's our Frenchman.

378
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,791
- Anton Bogart?
- It seems he managed

379
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,334
to cut out his tracking device,

380
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,461
and it's ended up inside that priest.

381
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,834
I see.

382
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,669
We now have one of our favorites

383
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,107
running around virtually invisible?

384
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,667
I'm sorry.
What shall I tell them to do?

385
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,839
I suggest you shorten his odds

386
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,507
and follow him.

387
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,550
Yes, sir.

388
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,345
Tech: Okay, maintain
visual contact with Bogart.

389
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,685
Don't lose sight of that
slippery little bastard.

390
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,818

Damn, Bogart's quick.

Go to camera two. Quick, go.

392
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,291
Just got to reconfigure.

393
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,355

00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,371
- It's him.
- You sure?

397
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,373
Oh, there are gonna be fireworks.

398
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,705
All right, Miss Hunter,
we have Harlow.

399
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,574
We have Harlow for you.

400
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,409
May I have your attention?

401
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,380
You wanted
the greatest show on Earth.

402

Out for revenge,

403
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,188
the greatest assassin of our time.

Cut the shit, Eddy.

407
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,076
Oh, shit.

408
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,450
- What are you doing here?
- I need information.

409
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,421
What have you heard?

410
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,152
I heard someone
came for you.

411
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,456
[Tires screech]

412
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,393
Eddy:
I heard it got a bit messy.

413
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,200
And I heard about your wife.

414

Joshua:
What did you hear? Who told you?

415
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,271
The crazy American kid, Miles.

416
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,604
He's your one.

417
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,840
Miles Slade, the finger guy?

There's a good dog.

That's the emergency line.
What do I do?

- Excuse me, Senator.
- All right.

It's Lai Lai.

457
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,737
Make sure that redneck
settles his marker

458
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,777
before he has another coronary.

Who are you talking to, the police?

Quiet.
I know you can see what's going on.

Host:
You know the rules, Lai Lai.

464
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,187
It's kill or be killed.

465
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:02,158
You're like a child
running back to Daddy

466
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,091
telling me how
the big boy stole your ball.

467

You're on the battlefield.
There is no going back.

468
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,363
And he's just one of those famous
innocent bystanders you hear about.

469
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,459
- Let me speak to him.
- No, stop it.

00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,334
- This is Father Macavoy.
- I'll kill you myself.

471
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:17,101
- Let me speak to him.
- It's not right. He's just a priest.

Host:
Personally, I find it kind of apt.

473
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,942
Back in the day we used to throw
Christians to the lions.

474
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,847
Seems that history
is repeating itself.

475

Carry him or kill him,

476
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,676
but don't call back.

00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,651

Are the police coming?

00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,625
Not really.

You've got a bug inside you.
They think you're a hitter.

00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,048
This is a competition for assassins.

497

That last man standing wins.

A game where people
kill each other?

the tracker out of you,

otherwise you're a target.

Why don't we go to the police?

Eh? You and l.

I don't wanna die.

547
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:17,213
- I don't know how to cope with this.
- You'll be okay.

Okay.

Oh, thank God.
Thank God.

What's happening?

557
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,575
I'm not sure,
but we have to get out of here now.

A policeman's been killed.

559
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,848
- He's a player.
- A player?

560
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,224
Why would anybody want
to take part in this madness?

561
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,287
Cash prize, revenge,
title, excitement.

562
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,195
So what's your reason?

563
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,386
Macavoy:
I've seen him before.

564
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,447
- In the cafe this morning.
- Are you sure?

565
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,720
- Positive.
- He cut it out.

566

Hold on!

I'm deeply sorry about your loss,

580

but I may have some information

581

about the person
that came after you.

582

you can find them.

Rob:
Oh, shit.

588
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,952
We got another one

Hamilton:
Jesus fucking Christ.

590
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,715
That's not a cluster.
That is a war zone.

Angel's titty bar?
Are you kidding me?

592
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:30,325
There's nine shooters in there.

593
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,656
Why aren't they
attacking each other?

594
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,162
Probably so many people
in the place

595
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,663
they don't know who is who.

596
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,825
All right, we got ourselves
a situation here.

597
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,664
We have nine players
in one location.

You drink too much

650

and your eyes give you away.

What are we going to do?

655

We have to wait until it passes
through your system.

656
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,993
The further out of town we go,
the less accurate the tracker.

657
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,623
It will buy us some time.

658
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,634
Do you mind
if I ask you a question?

659
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,101
Why are you here?

like a child this morning?

It must be tough playing God
with people's lives.

I don't play God.

If I don't do it,
somebody else will.

Otherwise,
why didn't you just kill me?

673

these are the last few
moments of your life

have a drink with me.

Maybe later.

This is really going to fuck you off.

for other people's work.

Don't you pass out on me, legend.

00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,885
I'm going to tell you
who killed your wife.

a fucking thing about it.

01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:17,780
we haven't met,

01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,792
So you're the sick fucker
that's running all this, are ya?

853
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,125
Such profanity
from a man of the cloth.

[Crowd chuckles]

855
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,623
Now I suggest you listen to me

856
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,328
very, very carefully.

857
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,461
Since you deemed it
necessary to interrupt

858
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,063
what could have been
a spectacular kill,

859
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,974
I feel I should clarify the rules a little.

860
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,808
There's a time limit
you really should take note of.

861
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,475
Time limit?
What are you talking about?

862
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,983
It's very simple.

863
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,316
You need to start killing
if you want to stay alive.

864
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,753
I'm not going to kill anyone.

865
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,814
We shall wait and see.

866
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,883
It will be your faith

867
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,428
against your desire to live.

868
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,987
That device inside you
is so much more than a tracker,

869
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,555
as you've just witnessed.

870
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:07,330
There's only four hours
left of the game, Father.

871
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,667
If there's more than
one player still alive

872

when the clock hits zero,

873
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,504

So let's see if you have any real guts.

876
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,547
It's kill or be killed.

877
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:25,018
Four hours, Father,

878
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:27,749
and the clock is ticking.

887
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,135
We have to do that to all of them

888
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:51,201
if the time runs out?

889
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,544
No, it takes them out automatically.

890
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,208

Macavoy:
Nothing's happening. I'm too tense.

895
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,223
It's got to come out
one end or the other.

896
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,424
[Sighs]

897
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,558
Can you not wait outside?

898
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,071
I'm staying put.
Now concentrate.

899
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,298
You're putting me off.

900
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,742
Can you whistle or something?

901
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,480
Okay, who's Joshua's wife?

902
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,350
It doesn't matter.

903
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,389
Okay.

904
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,322
I thought the way you reacted
when you heard--

905
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:38,622
Will you just leave it alone?

906
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,964
Bit of a confession
in here, really, eh?

907
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,106
Confession can be incredibly hard.

908
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,613
It's painful to admit our sins

909
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:02,014
and trust ourselves in God's care.

910
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,988
But it helps.

911
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,120
It helps...

912
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,662
sometimes.

913
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,691
Why don't you tell me
why you're here?

914
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,327
Hmm?

915
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,166
What's it got to do
with Joshua's wife?

916
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:39,821
The last thing you see
in a target's eyes...

917
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,016
is understanding.

918
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,928
Somewhere,
deep inside of them,

919
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:49,225
they've been expecting it.

920
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,927
Mary Harlow didn't have that look.

921
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,534
She just stared at me,

922
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:02,201
Iike you did this morning--

923
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:08,448
petrified, scared...

924
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,352
bewildered.

925
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,660
I saw in her eyes

926
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,423
that something was wrong.

927
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,800
Please!

928
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,661
My instincts told me to stop.

929
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,197
Please!

930
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,139
But I pulled the trigger anyway.

931

[Lai Lai crying]

932
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,218
I didn't know it until afterwards,

933
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,449
but she was pregnant.

934
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,085
It's haunted me ever since.

935
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,525
That's why I have
to win this tournament...

936
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,465
so I can get enough
money to vanish.

937
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,603
And if I don't win...

938
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:13,604
then I get what's coming.

939
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,924
Okay, Miss Hunter,
the final few players

940
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,429
seem to be converging
on the motorway.

941
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,828
We got Harlow on the move,

942
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,594
we're tracking Bogart nearby,

943
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,431
and the long shot, Topuzov,
is closing in fast.

944
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:38,200
Lai Lai Zhen and the priest
are sitting ducks.

[Door opens]

946
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,711
We have to get out of here now.

947
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:54,813
- I haven't--
- Now.

948
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,414
Okay.

949
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,562
Shit.

950
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,339

Come on!

957

What's going on?

958
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,457
- I'm taking your bus.
- What?

959
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,126
I'm taking your bus.

- Learn fast!

What about the passengers?

Come and see this.

973

Maybe not.

has officially left the game.

if we don't have a winner
when the time runs out,

I was there for her.

want to kill Mary? Why?

I put on a good show, didn't l?

1092
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,219
You can keep all this money that I won,

1093

if you just tell me
why you murdered my wife.

1095
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:39,792
I'm dying, but you're sweating.

1096
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,530
Now why is that?

1097
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:46,734
What's the matter,
you afraid to admit it?

1098
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,332
Come on.

1099
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:50,934
Come on, we're all killers here!

1100
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:52,738
You need a doctor.

1101
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:55,074
You're being absurd.

1102
01:25:55,150 --> 01:26:00,452
Why? Why did you murder my wife?

1103
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:03,958
Or are you too fucking gutless?

1104
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,129
Why?

1105
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,997
Because it was necessary.

1106
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:17,767
You didn't want to come
back to the Tournament.

1107
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:20,239
I wasn't going to accept that.

1108
01:26:20,308 --> 01:26:22,503
You're the reigning champion.

1109
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,506
Look at you, Joshua!

1110
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:30,947
You're a warrior, gladiator.

1111
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:34,614
Men like you don't die
in your beds,

1112
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,213
they fall on the field.

1113
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,285
They give the crowd

1114
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:42,886
a glorious death.

1115
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:46,130
Why?

1116
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,731
Why?

1117
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:58,778
Because if I'd have just asked...

1118
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:03,140
you'd have said no.

1119
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,413
You needed
a little motivation--

1120
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:11,387
pressure...

1121
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:14,292
on that little
chink in the armor.

1122
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,529
Close your eyes.

1123
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,033
You and your wife

1124
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:22,433

Our little town has been tested,

played witness to events
beyond comprehension,

I'm reminded of the words

1155
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:47,810
of the American writer
Robert Nathan

1156
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:53,821
when he said,
"We must give thanks to the sorrow

1157

"that shows us pity,

1158

"to the pain
that teaches us courage,

which is a mystery still."
