1
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,100
What's that?

2
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,500
Ah, it's nothin'.

3
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,900
Does Jenny know?

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,200
I'm the man of my house, Tom.

5
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,900
I don't have to hide things
from my wife.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,400
I won't tell her.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,900
I appreciate it.

8
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,200
Try this.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,200
The nicotine's not your problem.
It's your oral fixation.

10
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,300
You just need
something else to suck on.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,200
I read it in some magazine.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,600
What kind of magazines
you been reading?

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,300
Easy.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,100
A man's gotta be able
to have something of his own.

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,600
How many shooters you count?

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,800
Five, six.

17
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,300
Somebody tipped them off.

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,400
All I know is we just lost
two whole fucking years of work.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,500
Want to take a look?

20
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,300
As long as it's just a look. On three.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,900
Three.

22
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,500
Son of a bitch.

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,700
Hey Tom. Backup's on its way.

24
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,500
FBI! Freeze! / Tom!

25
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,800
Jesus Christ!

26
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Don't jump off!

27
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,600
No!

28
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,300
John! You all right?

29
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Yeah.

30
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,000
Come on.

31
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Did you get him?

32
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,200
I got him.

33
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,600
You sure?

34
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,900
He took one in the face.
He's dead. Relax.

35
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,100
Hey, the morgue's full of people who
thought they got that son of a bitch.

36
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,800
What are you talking about, John?
You sound like you know this guy.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,100
Yeah, but there's talk the Yakuza

38
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,200
hired a rogue independent contractor
to deal with the Triads.

39
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,100
He's supposed to be the best.

40
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,600
The same guy the CIA used
in Jakarta that time.

41
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,900
The same guy that turned on his
handlers and then killed three agents.

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
I heard it was five.

44
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,100
That's a bullshit story, John.
You know that, all right?

45
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,800
The Rogue's a phantom; he's a myth.

46
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,700
Somebody at the Agency's
yanking your chain.

47
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
Titanium shells.
The penetrating bullets.

48
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,200
It was his signature.

49
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,400
You really think
Rogue was working for Yakuza?

50
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,700
That's the trouble with this business.

51
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,800
You never know who's working forwho.

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,600
This is the San Francisco Police.

53
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,000
Remain where you are
with your hands in the air.

54
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,100
Yeah, he's right here,
he's right here, John.

55
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,000
Hang... yeah, see you soon.
Okay. Bye-bye.

56
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,500
You tell him that
he cannot smoke in front of the kids.

57
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,100
If he's going to smoke
he can do it in the yard.

58
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,100
Okay.

59
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,400
Okay.

60
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,100
I thought he was already coming.

61
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,600
I thought he was, too.

62
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,800
Yo, Tom.

63
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,400
I gotcha!

64
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,800
Uh, Daniel, please.

65
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,900
- Danny, Danny. I'm on the phone.
- Daniel, come on. Come on.

66
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,300
You'd better be on the road.
Game starts in thirty.

67
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,500
I'm running a little behind.

68
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Figure if we don't hit traffic,
we'll make it up there by half-time.

69
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,900
John.

70
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,800
It's an oral fixation.

71
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,700
Ecch! Hey. Come on.
Get your coat.

72
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,900
So uh, how's the case going?

73
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,900
Look forget about the case.
Enjoy your sick leave.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,400
Any ideas who blew the op?

75
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,500
No. Investigation's underway.
So far... zip.

76
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
Somebody talked.

77
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,300
Somebody inside. Close to us.

78
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,100
Any word on what happened to Rogue?

79
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,400
No, we never found a body.

80
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,400
They dragged that bay
forthree days and nothing.

81
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,000
And he's fish food by now.

82
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,300
Okay.

83
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,200
Well, it's game day, right?

84
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,500
Yeah, I know it's game day.

85
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Just tell me you haven't
forgot the steaks, okay?

86
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
No, asshole,
I didn't forget the steaks.

87
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,500
Christ, when are you
going to let that go?

88
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,600
Diane asked me to check.

89
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
You know she also asked me to...

90
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard.
No smoking in front of the kids.

91
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,400
Honey, we got to stop off
and get some steaks.

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,200
Diane, they here yet?

93
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,000
Please.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,500
Diane, what was that?

95
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Diane.

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,800
Oh please!

97
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,800
Don't! / No!

98
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,400
No!

99
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,400
John. John! Honey.

100
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,900
Honey. Honey.

101
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,200
Oh, my God!

102
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,200
Stay with Daniel, honey.

103
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,900
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

104
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,800
What the hell happened?

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm gonna have to...

106
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,600
We got three fatalities.

107
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,300
What?

108
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,500
One male, one female, and one child.

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,500
Hey, wait a minute, pal. FBI or not...

110
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,400
Sir, CSI needs to finish.
We gotta let them do theirthing.

111
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,400
Sir? You gotta clear out of here now.

112
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,500
SAN FRANCISCO
THREE YEARS LATER

113
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,000
CLUB ZERO
YAKUZA DISTRICT

114
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,500
Hey, baby. How're you doing?

115
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,600
Get him!

116
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,000
Kimo!

117
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,000
Kimo!

118
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,600
Daito, heel

119
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,000
What the fuck!

120
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,600
Rogue do you know
what Shiro does to traitors?

121
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,400
Wow! These Japs sure
know how to party, huh?

122
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,300
Yeah. Smells like a deli in here.

123
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,100
Oh, shut up, Gleason.

124
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,700
You see all this ink?

125
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,200
Japanese Yakuza.

126
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Each one of those rings

127
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,300
is supposed to represent
some poor bastard they've killed.

128
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,100
These are some
bad ass characters here.

129
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,600
Yep. What's that make the people
who did this to them?

130
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,800
Make a hole.

131
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,500
Get these people out of here.

132
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
And just who the hell are you?

133
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,100
Asian Organized Crime Unit.

134
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,600
We'll be taking over from here.

135
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,700
On whose authority?

136
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,900
Mayor. President.

137
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,300
Take your pick.

138
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,600
- You don't look very Asian to me.
- You know,

139
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,400
I'm amazed you two don't have
this whole case wrapped up by now.

140
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,000
Check these yet, Einstein?

141
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,200
Yeah. Someone cut the feeds.
There's nothing on there.

142
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,000
Agent Crawford found these
in the back room.

143
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,100
We found him hiding
underneath one of the dead bodies.

144
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
He's in pretty bad shape.

145
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,300
Yeah, what's he been saying?

146
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,700
You're kidding me, right?

147
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,600
Who can understand that shit?

148
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,700
Some people come into this country...

149
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,300
you'd think they'd at least
learn to speak American.

150
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,300
You'd think a couple of cops
working a district

151
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,200
that's crawling with Yakuza
might learn to speak a little Japanese.

152
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,100
If they weren't complete fucking idiots.

153
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,200
Give me a minute here would you?

154
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,600
Hi. I'm a cop. What happened here?

155
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,600
Know what I do when I'm not a cop?
I play doctor.

156
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,400
Hey! You can't do that.

157
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,400
If I don't get this shrapnel out

158
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,300
it will get infected.

159
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,700
I got it. No, it's a bone. Sorry.

160
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,600
If you want me
to go back to my day job...

161
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,800
Give me something to do!

162
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,400
I want to die before he comes back.

163
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,000
Well...

164
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,300
I can see it's gonna be
a real picnic working with you.

165
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,300
You're not working with me.

166
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,400
This is the FBI's case now.

167
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,700
You want to help,
take my shirts to the cleaners.

168
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,600
So what'd he say?

169
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,100
Ah, a bunch of
Japanese mumbo jumbo.

170
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,600
Vengeful spirits.

171
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,100
Ghost stories

172
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,500
Jen?

173
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,200
Yeah, did I wake you?

174
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,000
It's almost nine.

175
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,700
Oh, no,
I was working late last night, that's all.

176
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,600
Oh, well, I just called to remind you

177
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,100
that it's Daniel's first
basketball game this Friday.

178
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,000
You forgot, didn't you?

179
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,800
No.

180
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,200
- I've just been tied up with work.
- See ya.

181
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,200
I've got a lot on my mind right now.

182
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah, so what's it this time?

183
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,400
I've found him, Jen.

184
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,800
Found who?

185
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,700
The guy who killed Tom.

186
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,400
He's back.

187
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,200
I can feel it.

188
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,000
This time I'm taking him down.

189
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,600
John, it's been three years.

190
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,800
Look, your obsession with
this man has cost you our marriage.

191
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,700
Don't lose your son.

192
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,300
Tell Daniel I'll be there.

193
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,500
No, you tell him!

194
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,700
And if you say you're gonna be there,
then be there.

195
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,100
Those of you who didn't get to meet
last night, this is Agent Goi.

196
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,000
Just graduated Quantico.

197
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,200
What's his specs?

198
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,500
Oxford.

199
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
What's so funny?

200
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
In otherwords, you're a spectator.

201
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,600
What about you?

202
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,300
D.T.

203
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,800
Defensive Tactics.

204
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,700
That's right.

205
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,600
I like to get up close and personal.

206
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Yeah, well, my gun's biggerthan yours.

207
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,600
Pick a desk.

208
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,300
Still getting set up here ourselves.

209
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
The back of the bus.

210
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,300
These are all the photos
anybody has of Rogue.

211
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,700
Bastard re-cuts his face
every six months.

212
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,700
Come on, John, anybody can use
titanium shells and DU bullets.

213
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,600
The ones we found-

214
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,800
The ones we found last night matched
the ones we found three years ago.

215
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,100
Rogue's back.

216
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,100
Okay, but if he works forthe Yakuza
why would he kill Yakuza?

217
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,000
Maybe he switched sides.

218
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Wouldn't be the first time.

219
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,100
What sides are we talking about?

220
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,400
Shiro Yanagawa.

221
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Fronts all Yakuza activity from Japan.

222
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,600
Probably the most
powerful man in San Francisco

223
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,000
and yet he's never even
set foot on American soil.

224
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,800
He's half the reason this task force
was put together.

225
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,300
Li Chang is the other half.

226
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,200
Unlike Shiro, Chang lives here.

227
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,400
Nice big mansion in Marin.

228
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,700
Thinks he's J.D. Rockefeller
or something.

229
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
He's a Four-Eighty-Nine.

230
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,200
Triad boss.

231
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,500
Into everything. Bribery, extortion,
murder, you name it.

232
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,300
But years ago
Shiro butchered Chang's family.

233
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,300
Actually had the balls
to fly overto Hong Kong,

234
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,300
and wipe out the whole fucking clan.

235
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,200
He spent the next thirty years
selling every

236
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,700
every heirloom in Chang Dynasty
to collectors' museums.

237
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,400
All that's left now is a couple of horses.

238
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,400
Statuettes. Two of them.
About this big.

239
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,000
Word on the street is that Shiro is
looking for a buyer as we speak.

240
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,700
Chang's loss of honor
means more than his financial loss.

241
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,700
I don't care about the losses.

242
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,600
I don't care about blood lines
or ancient family feuds.

243
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,900
The first time in three years
we got a real shot at getting Rogue.

244
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
All we have to do, ladies and
gentlemen, is pull the fucking trigger.

245
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,300
CHANG MANSION
MARIN COUNTY, CA

246
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,700
She's a very rare breed.

247
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,700
Andalusian. That's my wife, Maria.

248
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,600
In my father's day, such a union
would not have been possible.

249
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,700
But times change. Those of us
who change with it survive.

250
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,900
Come.

251
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,300
I am really impressed, Mr Shaw.

252
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,100
Now that you have spilled
the blood of my enemies...

253
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,600
let's drink to our new partnership.

254
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,200
I have to admit...

255
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,000
I was somewhat skeptical when you
first came to me with your proposal.

256
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:04,700
By leaving Shiro's service
that was a wise move on your part.

257
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,400
But it makes me wonder.

258
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,000
How could one truly trust a man
who has betrayed his master?

259
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,100
I have no master.
So I have betrayed no one.

260
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:24,500
So, tell me my Horses?
They arrive tonight?

261
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,800
It's been thirty years.

262
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,900
All this time my family
has lived in shame and dishonor.

263
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,000
All because of Shiro's treachery.

264
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,400
Tonight, I will take back
what was stolen from my family...

265
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,100
and everything
will change from here on.

266
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,000
Shiro's men will protect his
treasure with their lives.

267
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,600
Are you certain you can deliverthem?

268
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,300
I said I would.

269
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,800
These two are the Ti brothers.

270
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,100
They will give you everything you need.

271
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,400
I'll be in touch.

272
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,200
Watch him closely.

273
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,500
SHIRO'S ESTATE
YAKUZA COMPOUND

274
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
TO-DAI, JAPAN

275
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
I beg your forgiveness.

276
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,900
The fault is not yours, but mine.

277
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,900
I left myself unguarded.

278
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,000
I trust you have
news from San Francisco...

279
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,600
Yes, everything is
proceeding as requested.

280
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,700
...and the Horses?

281
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,200
We've shipped them out.

282
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,400
They will arrive
in San Francisco tonight.

283
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,900
You must return to San Francisco
in advance of my arrival.

284
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
But, Father...

285
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,400
I don't trust our people there.

286
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,700
They have become
too lazy to be useful.

287
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,400
I was hoping to stay here
and further my role in the clan.

288
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,500
Nothing in the history of our clan
has ever been more important.

289
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,000
I will not fail you.

290
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,400
Go now.
Oversee the sale of the Horses.

291
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,300
CHINA TOWN
SAN FRANCISCO

292
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Hey, what's up, dude?

293
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,800
I need to see Benny.

294
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,400
No Bennys here.

295
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Again!

296
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,000
What are you doing?

297
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,100
No!

298
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,900
Yeah!

299
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,600
Again!

300
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,600
Come one. Oww! Ooh!

301
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,800
Hey, babe.

302
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,600
We need to talk.

303
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,300
Cabron, I don't talk to the Feds.

304
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
Go!

305
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,500
Somewhere private.

306
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,200
Now.

307
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
Okay.

308
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,800
My guy's losing anyway, so...

309
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,200
I'm paying forthis shit. Come on!

310
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,700
Business is good, I see.

311
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,700
Yeah. So much
for Homeland Security, right?

312
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,200
So how's the family?

313
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Daniel's fine. But Jen.

314
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,900
That's another story.

315
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,800
Yeah, I really like her. I mean,
how could you fuck that up?

316
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,100
Well, it wasn't hard.

317
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,100
By the way, thanks forthat out there.

318
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,300
Made me look good.

319
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,800
Well, hope it helps.

320
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,100
Yeah, well, the people I'm tracking,

321
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,900
they expect the FBI
to pay me some visits like this.

322
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
Makes me look legit.

323
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
Was that in the Interpol handbook?

324
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,800
Come on, John, there no science
to catching crooks you know that.

325
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,600
Yeah. You said
you had something for me.

326
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,500
Yeah.

327
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,900
Our friend over in Brussels,

328
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,600
the guy that makes
those titanium bullets

329
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
found him two days ago.

330
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,300
Then I ran a check.

331
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,500
It seems everyone associated
with Rogue is having some bad luck.

332
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,000
Just last week...

333
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,600
plastic surgeon down in Panama
accidentally impaled himself...

334
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,100
with a kitchen knife
making a turkey sandwich.

335
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,300
Week before that another one of our
scalpel friends down in Florida

336
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,200
went skinny-dipping with some gators.

337
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,500
Guess he didn't read the signs. Anyway.

338
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,300
These guys, they both
specialize in facial reconstruction.

339
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,900
Both of them.

340
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,900
Our man's tying up loose ends.

341
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,500
Yeah, well there's another surgeon
unaccounted for.

342
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Think he might be still alive,
maybe hiding out.

343
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,400
You let me know
the second he surfaces.

344
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,900
Right. Thanks Benny.

345
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,700
Button up, this isn't a disco.

346
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,000
Is that our contact?

347
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,300
Yes my contact.

348
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,600
Get rid of him.

349
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,400
He's my brother. He's with me.

350
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,600
Who the fuck does this guy think he is?

351
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,800
Go back to your car.

352
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,300
Wu, please. He's an outsider.

353
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,000
Go! Don't make me say it again.

354
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,300
Afterthis is done
you and I are going to talk.

355
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,100
The Horses are intact.
Shiro will be pleased.

356
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,400
We will contact you when we get there.

357
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,700
Are the Horses safe with this crew?

358
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,900
Of, course, as far as they know
they're just delivering cars.

359
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,900
Stay calm and cooperate.

360
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,100
It's just a routine check.

361
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,400
I need you out of the car, both of you.

362
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,000
Put your hands where I can see them.

363
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,700
Officer, we're with
Shiro Yanagawa Enterprises.

364
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,100
You are making a huge mistake.

365
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,200
We have made arrangements.

366
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,600
Out of the car!

367
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,200
Do it. Turn around.

368
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,200
We work security.

369
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,900
We have licenses to carry firearms.
Call your Captain.

370
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,700
- Shut up. Shut up.
- He'll vouch for us.

371
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,800
- Fucking rent a cops.
- Shut up.

372
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,200
Good evening.

373
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,200
Captain Andrews,
what the fuck is going on?

374
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,600
What about our arrangement?

375
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,700
Just a little change in plan.
I need my money. Now.

376
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,500
So, we are good to go?

377
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh, yeah. You're good to go.

378
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,400
Just wait here for a sec.
Let me and the boys clear out.

379
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,300
Let's go.

380
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,900
Do it.

381
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,300
Mr. Chang sends his regards.

382
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,500
No-o-o!

383
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,300
CHANG'S WAREHOUSE 16

384
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,200
Compliments of Mr. Chang.

385
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,700
Some serious shit here, brother.

386
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,400
Yakuzas. All of them.

387
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,600
All lined up, shot through the back.
Execution-style.

388
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,000
Excuse me, Forensics wants to know if
you're ready forthem to come in yet.

389
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,200
It was a heist.

390
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,400
What?

391
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,300
Check the space between these sedans.

392
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,000
These guys were
escorting something big.

393
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,700
Whatever it was,
it must have been important.

394
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,900
These guys were the guard dogs.

395
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,200
But they left their guns in the cars.

396
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,500
There's only one thing that would stop
these guys from throwing down.

397
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,600
Cops.

398
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,000
At least they thought they were cops.

399
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,700
Hold on just a damn minute. Are you
trying to say that cops did this?

400
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,400
If they didn't, they were involved.

401
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,300
No fucking way!

402
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,000
For all we know
it could have been one of you guys.

403
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,900
I'm assuming that
you know who the fuck I am.

404
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,300
You're a bitch for Shiro Yanagawa
aren't you, Captain?

405
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,900
You're the one who gives his boys
free passage to smuggle in shit.

406
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,600
And you're the one
who sold them out last night.

407
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

408
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,000
I've never met Yana...

409
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,900
Hey-hey-hey-hey.

410
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
This is a Federal matter.

411
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,200
Look at it. Look down the barrel.

412
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,300
Tell me if you see the bullet.

413
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,400
- Can you see it?
- I see it.

414
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,700
He said he'll kill me.

415
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,000
He said he'll kill my family.

416
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,900
Who?

417
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,300
Who said that?

418
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,900
I don't know who!

419
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,500
Who?

420
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,200
I don't know who. He's with the Triads.

421
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,700
He works forthe Changs.

422
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,000
He knows where I live.

423
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,400
He knows where my kids go to school.

424
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,000
You stupid bastard.

425
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,700
What do you think
Shiro Yanagawa's gonna do

426
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,700
when he finds out you fucked him?

427
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,500
Get a statement. Call the marshals.

428
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,900
Put his family under protective custody.

429
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,900
Down, down, down! Everyone down!

430
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,400
A shooter on the! roof!

431
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,300
Guys!

432
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,500
This is Agent Wick.

433
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,800
I need Chase Squad backup

434
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,200
and an ambulance
to Sloan's Steakhouse. Now!

435
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,500
Hang on, motherfucker.

436
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,900
Nothing!

437
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,500
This motherfucker's out.

438
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,000
YAKUZA HEADQUARTERS
SAN FRANCISCO

439
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,800
The Triads made us look like fools.

440
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,400
Kill. Kill them.

441
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,300
Give me the word...

442
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,600
...and I'll make them disappear.

443
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,400
Do it. Find them.

444
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,300
I want all the heads
of every one of them.

445
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,600
Nobody told me
you two were in charge now.

446
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,800
Kira-san. Welcome home.

447
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,300
Your presence honors us.

448
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,100
And your stupidity insults my father.

449
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,900
We were just discussing...

450
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I've brought word from Shiro directly.

451
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,400
You are to do nothing
until he instructs you to.

452
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,800
The Horses have been stolen!

453
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,000
If we do not strike back...

454
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,700
Are you disobeying my father?

455
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,400
Good. I'd like a salad.

456
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,800
I just got off a fourteen hour flight.

457
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,300
I'd like a salad.

458
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,100
Will somebody get me a salad?

459
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,200
What What kind?

460
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,500
Chef. No blue cheese.

461
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,500
No blue cheese.

462
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,700
Takada...

463
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,300
With dressing on the side, please.

464
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
Hai.

465
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,600
Bitch.

466
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,000
Yeah.

467
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,000
Special Agent Crawford.

468
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,000
Who is this?

469
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,600
A messenger.

470
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,500
A messenger, huh?

471
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,600
The police captain in the restaurant,
was he part of your message?

472
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,100
He was a crooked cop.

473
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,300
I just did what you want to do.

474
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,200
What the hell do you know about
what I want, you fuck?

475
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,900
I saw it in your eyes, John.

476
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,200
Yeah, what did you see?

477
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,200
Pain. Rage. Loneliness.

478
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,200
I'll tell you what,

479
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,500
why don't we meet at
my shrink's office and discuss it.

480
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
You want the stolen shipment?

481
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,100
Warehouse Sixteen. One hour.

482
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,900
CHANG'S WAREHOUSE 16

483
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,900
This is the FBI.

484
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,700
Remain where you are and keep
your hands above your heads.

485
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,900
What? Not happy to see us?

486
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
This is private property.

487
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,100
RSVP. We came to party, baby.

488
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,400
Li Chang.
You still pretending to be legit?

489
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:42,800
Watch your mouth.
You forget who you're talking to here.

490
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Open it.

491
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,700
I said, open it.

492
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
Open it!

493
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,700
Put your hands
on the back of your head.

494
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,100
Now, motherfucker.

495
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,800
Get your fucking hands up.

496
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,700
No weapons. He's clean.

497
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,500
Victor Shaw.

498
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,300
So that's what
you call yourself now huh?

499
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,100
Hong Kong passport but
security license out of Tokyo. Fine.

500
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,000
Check the warehouse.
Make sure nothing's hidden.

501
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,000
It's you, isn't it?

502
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,600
I remember your eyes.

503
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,400
There's something
real familiar about them.

504
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,300
It's the one thing the surgeons
can't change, can they?

505
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,700
The eyes.

506
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,500
They did a helluva job
on the rest of you, though.

507
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,100
Wouldn't even know
you're the same man.

508
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,600
But you are, aren't you?
I know you are.

509
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,200
So what's the Yakuza hit man doing
working forthe Triads?

510
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,300
I know you understand me.

511
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,700
It was you on the phone, wasn't it?

512
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,600
What, don't remember?

513
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,600
Maybe you remember my partner.

514
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,400
You do, don't you?

515
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,700
Remember his name? Tom Lone.

516
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Remember his wife, Diane?

517
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,700
His four-year-old daughter, Amy?

518
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,100
Remember a cabin in the woods.

519
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:25,400
A cabin that you burned to the ground
with their bodies still inside?

520
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,500
Rememberthat?

521
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,300
Do you rememberthat?

522
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,200
Say it. Say it. Say you remember.

523
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:43,100
Say you fucking remember blowing
my partner's goddamn head off!

524
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,800
You will find only pain,
living in the past.

525
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,500
Crawford, there's nothing here.
He checks out.

526
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,600
It's him, Terry. I fucking know it.

527
00:46:53,900 --> 00:47:00,500
So what if it is? Hm?
Look, right now we got nothing.

528
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,500
Come on, man,
it'll be another day. All right?

529
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:11,700
But right now we wait.
We play it smart. And we do it right.

530
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,600
Another day.

531
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,000
Another day you and I
are going to finish this.

532
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,000
Count on that.

533
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,100
Everyone move out.

534
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,700
How in the world
did you know the FBI were coming?

535
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,900
Experience.

536
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,900
You have impressed me
once again, my friend.

537
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:01,900
As you see,
the FBI has declared war on us.

538
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,500
Well, fuck them!

539
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,000
I trust you have secured my Horses?

540
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,000
They are safe.

541
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,000
I still have a lot of work
for you to do, my friend.

542
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,400
I think you'd better
stay in my house for a while.

543
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,500
Keep an eye on things.

544
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,600
Understood.

545
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,800
Oh, Victor.

546
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,200
This FBI guy, Crawford, he is trouble.

547
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,900
He's chasing ghosts.

548
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,000
Give me a new one.

549
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,600
I said put up a new one now!

550
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,100
Mommy.

551
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,100
Did I scare you?

552
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,600
Where is the mother?

553
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,300
Do you want to play?
We could play tag.

554
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,100
Go find your mother.

555
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,000
I have things to do.

556
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,300
What's that?

557
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,000
Wow! Do it again.

558
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,500
Ana.

559
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,600
He's showing me a magic trick.

560
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,700
Why don't you go downstairs
and play for Mommy.

561
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,900
But we were playing.

562
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,300
I know but I'll be downstairs
in just a minute, okay?

563
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,500
Bye.

564
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,300
I understand you have business here

565
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,000
but I am warning you
to stay away from Ana.

566
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,600
My husband's work and our family
are two separate things.

567
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,700
Do we understand each other?

568
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,600
Yes, Mrs. Chang.

569
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,900
Good.

570
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,400
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

571
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:34,200
Mr. Chang might think
you're his man right now

572
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,900
but I'm still the one
who looks afterthings around here.

573
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
At every moment
in the world things change.

574
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,000
- TRIAD DISTRICT-
Don't make me say it again!

575
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,900
...he fucking tells me.

576
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,000
- Do you know how much-
- Relax.

577
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,900
What the fuck?

578
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,200
Mother fucker!

579
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,000
Fucking Yakuza. Let's go!

580
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,900
...teach that fucking Jap a lesson.

581
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,500
YAKUZA DISTRICT

582
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,400
Triads are coming!

583
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,300
Triad motherfuckers get 'em!

584
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,100
Buddha-heads!

585
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,200
Fucking Yakuza!

586
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,500
You fucking bastard.

587
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,500
I knew we should
never have trusted you.

588
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,800
Subtle, ain't it?

589
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,800
It's got Shiro's trademark.

590
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,000
So what now?

591
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,800
Get ready for a war.

592
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,400
Joey Ti. Got your ass.

593
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,300
Park, I want you outside
Chang's place in Marin.

594
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,400
Daniels, you get Yanagawa Motors.

595
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,800
Kinler, you get Warehouse sixteen.

596
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,100
Wick, take Goi.
Keep an eye on the Sayu Teahouse.

597
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,800
I get the new guy, huh?

598
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,600
I think I know
how to look through a night scope.

599
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,800
Hey, eyes open, everybody.

600
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,000
The shit's gonna go down somewhere.

601
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,500
Be ready to move
when you get the call.

602
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,800
Binoculars. No night scope.

603
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,000
The authorities are
expecting us to retaliate.

604
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,900
We strike now, we risk everything!

605
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,600
What if it was your family?

606
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,700
What the fuck is wrong with you?

607
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,600
You forgot?
Once it was my family.

608
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,100
Joey was like a son to me.

609
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,800
Revenge is a must.

610
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,100
But you've got to learn to be patient.

611
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:30,700
I will allow nothing
to put our family at risk.

612
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,600
I want you to do nothing.

613
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,900
Is that clear?

614
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,900
Shiro knows his days
are coming to an end.

615
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,500
One thing's for sure...

616
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,400
more blood will be spilled
before this is over.

617
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,200
Mr. Shaw...

618
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:12,100
I want yourword that my wife
and daughterwill be safe.

619
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,000
No harm will come to them.

620
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,300
A man should never give up his honor.

621
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,500
Orthe honor of his family.

622
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,500
Keep them.

623
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,900
I don't smoke.

624
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,700
SAYU TEA HOUSE

625
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,300
SAYU TEA HOUSE
YAKUZA DISTRICT

626
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,000
Oh, man!

627
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,500
I didn't know your mama
was working tonight.

628
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
Keep your eye on the mark, Goi.

629
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,000
Yo, heads up!

630
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,600
Looks like Takada's having
a little tea party, huh?

631
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,300
Have some spicy tuna.

632
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,700
Shit! Get Crawford and call for backup!

633
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,000
It's going down now!

634
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,900
Crawford.

635
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,800
We got trouble.

636
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,500
Wu just showed up just like you said.

637
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:33,500
I'm on my way.

638
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,700
Copy that.

639
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,800
Get down!

640
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,700
I'm going in. Cover me.

641
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,600
This is for my brother.

642
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,600
He's dead! Come on!

643
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,200
On three.

644
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,400
What?

645
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,400
Three!

646
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,500
Oh! Shit!

647
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:16,500
Wick!

648
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:17,600
Shit!

649
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,700
FBI. Drop yourweapons.

650
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,800
Drop yourweapons!

651
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,600
Hands on the counter
where I can see them.

652
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:32,700
Closer.

653
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,900
Situation secure.
All units stand down and cease fire.

654
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,800
Damnit, Goi!
He said cease fucking fire!

655
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,200
Shit.

656
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,000
Look. Goi's right there.

657
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,500
We got a shooter guys.

658
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,300
I got him!

659
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,200
Don't fucking move!

660
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,400
Get the other one!

661
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,400
Fuck you!

662
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:38,700
In Japan! You'd be dead!

663
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,000
This isn't Japan.

664
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,400
I said no. No-no-no.

665
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,000
Yes.

666
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:16,000
Wu and his boys shot up
Takada's teahouse last night.

667
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,500
What?

668
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:22,000
Wu Ti? Uh, are you sure?

669
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,300
I tried to stop them.

670
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:28,000
Goddamnit!
I told him not to do anything.

671
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,000
He leaves me with no choice.

672
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:44,800
You've done well.
My father is very pleased.

673
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,700
He now asks one more thing of you.

674
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,800
After I kill Chang
his operation will be destroyed.

675
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,000
What more could Shiro want?

676
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,400
The heads of the wife and child.

677
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,800
Why?

678
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,400
That's the order.

679
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,900
There is no why.

680
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,400
You never had a problem
killing women and children before.

681
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,900
Would you dare disobey your master?

682
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,600
I have no master.

683
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,900
These are my guards.

684
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,700
They will assist you on this task
as you best decide.

685
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,400
If I refuse?

686
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,400
You dropped this.

687
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,600
What is happening, John?

688
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,500
There are men with guns
in my front yard.

689
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,000
Just a precaution.

690
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,200
A precaution? Forwhat?

691
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,000
What've you gotten us into?

692
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,200
Oh, my God.

693
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,700
It's him. Isn't it?
He's coming after us.

694
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,300
That's not gonna happen.

695
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I'm sorry, Jen.

696
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,600
Not just forthis. For everything.

697
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,400
I tried to do the right thing.

698
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,000
Make a good life for you and Daniel.

699
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,300
To give you the things you needed.

700
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,200
It never had anything to do
with what we did or didn't have.

701
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,700
It was the job.

702
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,800
The job always came first, even now.

703
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,200
Even knowing you might be
putting us in the same danger

704
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,200
Tom and his family were in.

705
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,300
You know...

706
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,700
I'm not even mad at you anymore.

707
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,600
Most days I just feel sorry for you.

708
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,400
Forwhat you've become.

709
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,000
It's Benny.

710
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,400
Say hi to Benny for me.

711
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,000
What've you got, Benny?

712
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,300
We found your plastic surgeon.

713
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,200
Tijuna Mexico

714
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,000
Welcome home, Dr. Sherman.

715
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,100
Hey Jefe, what's cooking?

716
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,900
Step in here.

717
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,800
Let's have a talk. Come on.

718
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,300
Agent Crawford, is that?

719
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,700
I don't-I don't-I don't know anything.

720
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,000
Really. I don't know anything.

721
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,900
Doc!

722
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:56,900
Come on, you kidding me?

723
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,200
Can you explain to me

724
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,400
why one of the world's most
brilliant nip-and-tuckers

725
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,200
is hiding out in the slums of Mexico?

726
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,300
What are you,
a fucking Nazi war criminal?

727
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:04,900
Look, I were you,

728
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,700
I'd be lapping up that pussy
on South Beach stretching it out.

729
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,200
Come on, now.

730
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,500
Look, I could give a shit about
whatever laws you've broken.

731
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,500
That's not why we're here.

732
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,800
I need you to identify this man.

733
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,900
You know what happened
to the othertwo doctors.

734
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,100
We know you could be next.

735
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,300
We can protect you.

736
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,800
You don't know him. Protect me?

737
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,700
You can't protect me.
You can't stop him.

738
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,200
You found me here,
he can find me here.

739
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,500
I can stop him.

740
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:43,000
All I need from you is a yes or a no.
Is this Rogue?

741
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,500
Is this Rogue?

742
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,400
We uh, we-we...

743
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:59,900
We used to get uh, commissioned
by the U.S. government

744
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:04,400
and we'd all do our surgeries on him
when he was with the CIA.

745
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,100
We changed his face a lot of times.

746
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
He, uh he came to me
three years ago.

747
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,000
His face was almost torn off.

748
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,800
I just did what I could.

749
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,700
I repaired the muscle,
the nerve tissue.

750
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,000
Then I reconstructed the facial bones.

751
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,300
I never saw him again.

752
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,000
This is what I made him look like.

753
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,200
Look, Doc,
we're going to take you with us.

754
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:36,500
We're going to protect you,
understand?

755
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,500
Now why don't you go get
somethings together and we'll go.

756
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,300
Doc!

757
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,800
What? Yeah. Is it okay if l-if I...

758
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,700
Yeah-yeah-yeah. Go ahead.

759
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,500
You believe in fate Benny?

760
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,900
Fate?

761
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,100
Yeah.

762
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:08,600
You know, no matterwhat you do
your future's already decided?

763
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,800
I don't know about that.

764
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,700
I always thought your future
depends on what choices you make.

765
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,700
I have made all
the necessary arrangements.

766
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,800
I will join you as soon as I finish here.

767
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:36,700
Okay?

768
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,400
Don't worry.

769
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,700
Okay, I'll be back to walk you out.

770
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,000
I love you.

771
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,100
My crew's gone.

772
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,400
My brother is dead.

773
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,000
You brought it onto yourself.

774
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,000
And how did I do that?

775
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,000
I gave you my trust.

776
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,000
I gave you my loyalty.

777
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:41,200
I sacrificed everything for you
and this is how I'm treated?

778
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,100
You've got a lot of nerve
to talk to me about loyalty.

779
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,600
You're a fucking traitor!

780
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,200
Die!

781
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,400
That piece of shit.
He tells me that he's loyal.

782
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,600
That he's my friend.

783
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,000
I trusted him.

784
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:17,500
He's right. He was loyal.
He was your friend.

785
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:18,400
What?

786
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:29,700
Shit.

787
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,100
AOC base from Clark.

788
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,900
We got some major action
at the Chang mansion.

789
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
What's going on? Is the boss okay?

790
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,700
Mommy loves you, okay. Just...

791
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,300
No!

792
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,500
Chang is dead.

793
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,800
And the woman and child?

794
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,100
Take me to the bodies
so I can take their heads.

795
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,800
No. I killed them.
I should have that honor.

796
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,000
Come on! Kill him!

797
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:08,400
Are you okay? Where is my husband?

798
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,100
Where's Clark?

799
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,400
He's on his way back.

800
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,500
He send the photos?

801
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,800
Yes, sir.

802
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,900
What the fuck happened up there?

803
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,300
Looks like Rogue took out Chang and
turned on Shiro's assassins.

804
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:59,600
He's using them.
Playing both sets against each other.

805
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:00,900
Why would he do that?

806
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,600
John! You're never gonna believe
who just flew in.

807
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,200
Father, I'm so happy to see you.

808
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,200
And I am happy to see you.

809
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,100
This country looks very beautiful.

810
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,700
Your English is improving.

811
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,500
I have been practicing.

812
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,600
This is my new home after all.

813
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,900
Rogue insisted on
delivering the Horses himself.

814
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,500
You've made me very proud.

815
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,500
I must ask for one more thing of you.

816
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,400
Anything.

817
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,000
Return to Japan.

818
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:55,300
But I want to stay with you.

819
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,400
If I am to oversee our expansion here

820
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,700
I need someone
who can insure our interests in Japan.

821
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:06,300
The only person
I can trust is you, Kira.

822
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,100
Shiro Yanagawa!

823
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,600
FBI Special Agent John Crawford.

824
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,400
Step back

825
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,800
Welcome to America.

826
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:21,400
Now don't unpack.
You won't be staying long.

827
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,900
Agent Crawford...

828
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,500
I'm a busy man.

829
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:28,400
Oh, we got a lot of business,
you and me.

830
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,200
I think you know that.

831
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:34,500
Three years ago
Rogue killed my partner and his family.

832
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,500
And you know what?

833
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,500
Rogue was working for you.

834
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,800
Rogue is a myth. Just a rumor.

835
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,100
You think so, huh.

836
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,800
You can't always trust rumors, can you?

837
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:58,100
Rogue turns around and fucking slices
up the heavy hitters you sent with him.

838
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:01,700
Now you gotta ask yourself, now
why would he do something like that?

839
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,100
I've never seen this man
before in my life.

840
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,200
Look...

841
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,600
I don't care if you fuckers slaughter
each othertill you're all dead and buried.

842
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:15,900
Truth is it makes my job a lot easier.

843
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,300
But if I find proof that
ties any of this shit back to you...

844
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,400
you ain't never gonna see Japan again.

845
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,200
And neitherwill that
pretty little daughter of yours.

846
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,100
Thanks forthe tip

847
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,400
Agent Crawford.

848
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,200
Finally! My most loyal stranger.

849
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,100
We meet face to face.

850
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Yanagawa-san, I've waited
a long time forthis moment.

851
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:51,100
It's all because of you
that we now have this opportunity.

852
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,100
Kira enjoyed working with you here.

853
01:19:55,300 --> 01:20:00,000
One day she'll make a fine leader
of Yanagawa clan.

854
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:06,100
Yeah, one day.
I'm reminded of the Sengoku...

855
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:12,700
when the daimyo warriors fought
each otherto unite Japan.

856
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:18,200
The one who finally succeeded was
a man by the name of Oda Nobunaga.

857
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,000
And do you know how he did it?

858
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:25,300
He killed everyone who opposed him.

859
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,800
Thanks to you all those
who oppose me here are dead.

860
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,100
I exist but to serve you.

861
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,500
In Asia these could never be sold.

862
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:53,700
But the fortune
they will bring here in the West...

863
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:57,800
will be more than enough
to continue our American expansion.

864
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,100
And now it is time for your reward.

865
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,300
Open it.

866
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
One must remove all future threats.

867
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:31,100
You allowed that threat to remain
by not killing the woman and child.

868
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,800
You have disobeyed me
and broken my most sacred code.

869
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,400
Your code, not mine.

870
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,500
Betrayal cannot be forgiven.

871
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,900
Take him downstairs.

872
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,500
Persuade him to tell us
where the wife and child are.

873
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,800
They are truly magnificent.

874
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:13,100
So many dead for such small trinkets.

875
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,400
Fakes!

876
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:28,800
Find the woman and child...

877
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,500
They'll lead us to the real Horses.

878
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:47,100
Yanagawa-san!

879
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,800
After all these years...

880
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,600
why do you do this?

881
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,500
You ordered the hit.

882
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,600
I ordered many hits.

883
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:42,500
This one was different.

884
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:30,100
You should have left
the wife and daughter alone.

885
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,500
I left none to seek revenge.

886
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,700
You left one!

887
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:42,300
Your assassin, Rogue,
never made it out alive.

888
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,400
So, you are Tom Lone?

889
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,500
Changing your face, your voice.

890
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,300
All so you could get to me.

891
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,400
Pain can be a weapon,
if you so choose.

892
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:22,300
How do you think we found out
you were FBI in the first place?

893
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,800
It was Crawford.

894
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,400
You killed my family.

895
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:40,400
It was Crawford.
He's the one who gave you up.

896
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,700
Crawford works for me.

897
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,300
Because of him your family's dead!

898
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:59,100
Somebody talked.

899
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:01,200
Inside. Close to us.

900
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,500
You never know who's working forwho.

901
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,900
Somebody talked.

902
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,400
Crawford?

903
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:03,900
Shiro's dead.

904
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:12,300
Get out of this business
while you can, Goi.

905
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,500
Make a New Life...

906
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,900
From America? Leave me.

907
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,800
Make a new life...

908
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,200
Crawford.

909
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,200
Rememberthe night we met?

910
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:05,800
I remember my partner
blowing your face off.

911
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:09,600
You live today
only because of what he did.

912
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:15,400
I live today only to kill you,
you miserable prick.

913
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:18,100
Meet me there.

914
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:30,000
Goi

915
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,500
Where are you?

916
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:44,600
Show yourself!

917
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:50,200
I got your surgeon.
He made a positive ID.

918
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:57,400
Come on, Crawford. Flush him out.

919
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,000
It's over, Rogue.

920
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:02,100
Can you hear me?

921
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,100
Why did you do it?

922
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:07,300
What did Shiro promise you
that was worth my life

923
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,900
and the life of Diane and Amy?

924
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:23,800
No, you're not him. It can't be.

925
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,000
You don't even sound like him.

926
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,400
Look at my eyes, John.

927
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,300
The one thing the surgeons
can never change.

928
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,700
Oh, Jesus, Tom.

929
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,400
Is it really you?

930
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,600
Yeah.

931
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,700
Why didn't you tell me?

932
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,800
It was the only way
I could get the man responsible.

933
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,500
But all along...

934
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:53,000
I neverthought it would
bring me back to my best friend.

935
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,700
I didn't know they'd send Rogue.

936
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,100
For Christ sakes,
I thought he was dead!

937
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:03,600
They said they wanted
to teach you a lesson.

938
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:08,200
For shooting Rogue.
Just rough you up a bit, that's all.

939
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:11,500
Is that what they told you?

940
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,900
Shiro ordered everything.

941
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:20,400
I tried to stop working for him,
to get out, so many times.

942
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,800
I thought if I could make
that son of a bitch

943
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:28,000
pay forwhat he did to you, somehow
it would make things right again.

944
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:36,300
You think you could forgive me, Tom?

945
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,000
Tom Lone is dead.

946
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,400
My name is Rogue.

947
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:43,500
No...

948
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:49,800
Shit!
