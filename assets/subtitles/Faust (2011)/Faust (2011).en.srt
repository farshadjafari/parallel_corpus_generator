A fllm by
Alexander Sokurov

6
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,201
Based on the tragedy by
Johann Wolfgang vnn Goethe

7
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,315
You've told us so much about
the composition of the human body...

8
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,198
...but not a word about the soul.

9
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,357
I haven'! found ii.

10
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,194
Where does one look for the soul?

11
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,396
The skin is (hi n, perforated...

12
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,278
Large and lung...

13
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,358
The soul. And life...

14
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,318
Where are they hidden, then?
In the head?

15
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,311
There's only rubbish in there!

16
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,193
Or in the heart?

17
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,312
Sometimes I have the feeling that...

18
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,155
...both reside in the feet.

19
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,237
- How do you mean?
- If one is startled...

20
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,351
Up, up, up, up!

21
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,278
...Then one suddenly feels...

22
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,392
...so much life in the startled feet.

23
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,233
Nonsense!

24
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,399
You clean up here!
The rag is dirty, too.

25
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,354
- That rag ls clean.
- Smell for yourself!

26
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,358
I made a mistake.

27
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,391
It's the formalin!

28
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,232
Do you thlnk that
I'm already dead?

29
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,393
- That was an accident.
- Like the berries with carbolic acid...

30
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,233
...you served me last night?

31
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,318
Carbolic acid dulls the pain.

32
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,318
The paln of the world.
And the pain of the soul.

33
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,390
What the soul ls and
where it resides...

34
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,352
...only God knows.
And the Foe of all mankind.

35
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,196
Qult babbling.
Carbolic acid, carbolic acid...

36
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,198
And one of them has finally flown!

37
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,193
Su, where will Hind...

38
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,398
...these two gentlemen?
- God is everywhere.

39
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,194
- Thus He ls nowhere.
- And the Devil: they say...

40
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,278
...where there ls money,
there you find the Devil.

41
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,190
- I have no money.
- Then you're not the Devil.

42
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,358
Thank you. That's very reassuring.

43
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,352
- Who ls he then?
- No one knows for sure.

44
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,234
Word has it, the fat guy In the square
might be something of the sort.

45
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,391
Really?

46
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,398
- What would you wlsh for?
- From the Devil?

47
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,155
Two things. Firstly, I'd wish
to rid myself of the entire world.

48
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,321
Secondly, I'd wlsh to see you
more often.

49
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,391
How could you see me more often...

50
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,198
...if the world were gone?

51
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,279
Simple.

52
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,280
The world goes away,
except for you and me.

53
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,190
Try someone else.
I'll stick with humanity.

54
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,235
For the common good.
The corpse can go. Be quick...

55
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,312
...it ls sta rtlng to stink.
- How shall I pay...

56
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,313
...the gravediggers?

57
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,194
They must walt untll tomorrow.
Then I will pay them.

58
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,238
- Come In. You can take hlm.
- What about our money?

59
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,352
- Tomorrow.
- Always the same.

60
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,352
So cold. That's that.

61
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,313
Excuse me.

62
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,360
Everything comes and goes
according to law...

63
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,360
...only man's Ilfe ls overcast
by faltering fortune.

64
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,278
The God who dwells within
my breast...

65
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,313
...who can shake my soul
in its depths...

66
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,318
...who slts enthroned over
all my powers...

67
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,200
...outside me He is powerless.

68
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,357
Professor, when shall the two
of them come by tomorrow?

69
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,356
I don'¢ want to hear about ii.

70
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,238
I am starving.

71
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,398
- I'm off!
- Where tn?

72
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,278
Where, where? There!

73
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,397
Hold him tight.

74
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,200
Why are you standing there stock-still?

75
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,193
- But he ls kicking!
- Old fool! Why are you kicking”

76
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,272
Nothing has changed.

77
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,271
Your son, Doctor.

78
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,312
I see. I'll he dune shortly.

79
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,233
Why does this place always stlnk
so terribly?

80
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,274
My father. An honourable man,
lost in the dark.

81
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,392
What use is all this to him?

82
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,195
What are you up tn!! Get out!
Thief I

83
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,319
Go and see what the Professor
is doing over there!

84
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,237
Tell hlm people are trying
to work over here!

85
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,273
You're wanted.

86
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,274
You are breaking his spine!

87
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,356
What do you want?

88
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,278
Nothing. To see you.

89
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,240
To see what? I'm not A painting.

90
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,192
It's too tight.
And you're charging money for this?

91
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,272
And whom exactly would I be charging?

92
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,351
Those people over there.

93
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,312
My patients don'¢ have anything.

94
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,273
Untie him, please.

95
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,232
Good method.
Tested on many a patient.

96
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,399
- And how many have survived?
- I've never counted.

97
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,159
As usual.

98
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,392
- Can you walk?
- I don't know.

99
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,391
- Steady on your legs?
- Yes.

100
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,314
- Then get out of here!
- What the heck?

101
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,200
Tomorrow you will be hopping around
like a rabbit.

102
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,313
Are you sleeping poorly?

103
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,278
I don'¢ sleep at all.

104
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,278
Someone has survived the rack.

105
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,318
- At last!
- You love your rack.

106
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,200
One can't work on
an empty stomach.

107
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,278
True.

108
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,194
These are God's gifts.

109
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,194
Come, brothers. The flesh is calling.

110
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,199
Nothing has been cleaned!

111
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,353
I always have to do everything myself!
That George!

112
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,397
- Smells nice! What ls it?
- Here I am!

113
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,199
Out!

114
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,351
Mine!

115
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,193
It ls my due!
Who is the meat from?

116
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,396
From Frau Weber,
whose appendix you snipped.

117
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,278
- Didn't earn much.
- I don't have such huge needs...

118
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,318
...as our dear professor.
- Needs...

119
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,314
...I don't even have enough money
for ink.

120
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,357
I'm wllllng to forsake
everything -the house...

121
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,198
- Slt down.
...food. Anything.

122
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,239
- To do without ls good for one.
- If only I were certain...

123
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,393
- Of what?
- That what I'm doing has meaning.

124
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,354
No. I'm not giving you any.

125
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,239
No!

126
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,391
What? What do you mean?

127
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,272
Surely you want money?

128
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,239
He who limits himself...

129
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,234
...creates his own small fortune.

130
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,198
His own small fortune.

131
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,278
Heard tha! a thousand times.

132
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,398
One must work and never beg.

133
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,239
- You again!
- I've been waiting for two hours.

134
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,273
I'm sick. too.

135
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,398
What is it now? Let's have a look.

136
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,396
You are like an onion!

137
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,352
There is no getting close to you!

138
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,318
Lie dawn!

139
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,273
Help me.

140
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,318
I don'¢ understand -what is this?

141
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,158
Pass me the vaginal speculum.

142
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,272
Hold her legs down.

143
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,278
I work day and night.

144
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,198
I love no one, I have no family...

145
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,238
...I never sleep or eat.

146
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,234
I llnd your reproaches unjust.
I'm doing my best.

147
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,321
What good ls it to me if my soul
is empty! I feel no happiness...

148
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,152
...no anger, no compassion.
- The soul...

149
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,318
...one can do without it.
Why complicate things?

150
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,358
Matter. Black.

151
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,313
Hollow.

152
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,391
My hammer strikes the knee and
the leg twitches.

153
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,391
Tha!'s ii.

154
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,234
- That ls not enough for me.
- Then leave.

155
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,359
I have no money for you.
Nor the meaning of life.

156
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,274
Let's look at what we have here.

157
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,316
Tha!'s a pity.

158
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,393
Venus. Venus.

159
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,272
What are you doing"

160
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,200
He is a good man, your father.

161
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,193
A good man.

162
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,200
A good man, in his darkest yearning...

163
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,201
...still knows the one...

164
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,396
...true way.

165
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,232
Must do without.
You must do without.

166
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,192
That is the eternal song.

167
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,238
The eternal song.

168
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,392
The eternal song.

169
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,272
The eternal song.

170
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,160
- Let me through!
- Don't be so greedy!

171
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,396
- No! This has been ordered!
- Enough]

172
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,391
Shut up!

173
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,238
Would the gentleman have
a few pennies tn spare?

174
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,278
- No. I'm sorry.
- Just a few wins.

175
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,358
- We are starving!
- So am I.

176
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,351
Such a fine gentleman and no money.

177
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,396
Nothing in the pockets?

178
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,359
Noblemen are su forgetful,
aren't they?

179
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,318
- Snotty brat!
- Me? A brat? I'll smash your face in!

180
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,351
Watch ynurjewelsl

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,391

182
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,318
- Bastards!

183
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,358
- Cunny!
- Boneheadl

184
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,194
- Get lost!
- Let me. I'll show him!

185
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,193
I'll let you fly.

186
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,316
Who is this?

187
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,192
Good day, dear sir.

188
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,398
Who is this?

189
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,233
Black. like Death himself.

190
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,199
Good day, sir.

191
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,391
Or is Death grey?

192
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,272
Father Philipp. You're here already.

193
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,352
I thought I'd he late.

194
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,232
Debt after debt I have amended!

195
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,397
Yes, the affair ls settled
as far as you're concerned.

196
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,314
- There ls my coach.
- A remarkable pair.

197
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,149
Death and a priest.

198
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,198
Death and a priest.

199
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,194
And I, a starving man.

200
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,280
You're hungry, too?
Everybody is starving...

201
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,193
Who is this from?

202
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,316
From Lenz, the poet.

203
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,352
A strangely unhappy man...

204
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,396
No need In return ii.

205
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,200
The unhappy are dangerous!

206
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,391
Good day, sir.

207
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,316
My name ls Faust,
Doctor Faust.

208
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,358
I salute the learned gentleman!

209
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,238
I'm the owner of this firm.

210
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,234
My name is Muller, Mauririus.

211
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,198
I am Mauricius Muller...

212
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,396
Who are you, please?

213
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,193
A part of the power...

214
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,198
...that always does what's good.

215
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,318
Where does the second volce
come from? Does he have two tongues?

216
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,234
Do come in! I'm all ears.

217
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,233
Please be ca reful.

218
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,279
This is all pawned property?

219
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,390
A pledge of security,
as the law calls it.

220
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,318
- Thls ls my midwife's.
- Really?

221
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,360
- I know her. Frau Menzel.
- It's a small world.

222
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,393
And with these,
you weigh money?

223
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,391
No, souls.

224
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,397
- Are they heavy?
- No heavier than a coin.

225
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,278
- I thought so.
- Most of them...

226
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,313
...hut not yours.

227
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,239
The man has no sense of humnur.

228
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,318
Take a seai.

229
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,318
Thank you.

230
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,352
A starving man never
has a sense of humnur.

231
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,319
- Thls here.
- IH may.

232
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,396
I'd like to pawn this.

233
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,193
This is no ordinary ring!

234
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,232
The philosopher's stone!

235
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,273
It explains the nature of things.

236
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,194
- Then It must be worth something.
- On the contrary.

237
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,193
It's worth nothing.
Life has declined in value...

238
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,278
...not to mention death.

239
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,196
I don't understand.
What's worth anything then?

240
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,356
11 me... Art...

241
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,359
Who ls rustling there?
Who is creeping around?

242
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,358
I need money.

243
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,274
- Anything else you desire?
- I am still ton young...

244
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,194
...to be without desire.
- I have a desire, ton.

245
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,399
I collect autographs.
"The Foundations of Human Physiology."

246
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,352
- Dld you wrlte this?
- Even if I did...

247
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,319
...I couldn't slgn it for you.
I have no mnney for ink.

248
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,313
Soon I'll have to write in blood.

249
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,312
No need. I have ink.

250
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,198
Your knowledge is impressive.

251
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,160
Here you are.
This work will outlive you.

252
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,238
The word dies...

253
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,398
...before it leaves the pen.
- Over here, yes...

254
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,273
...but there is also the world beyond.

255
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,234
I'm so tlred. Ma n's wretched ways
exhaust me.

256
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,318
And my heart aches.

257
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,312
- Now, glve me the money!
- No.

258
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,390
- What would you accept In pawn?
- Anything.

259
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,313
- Even rubbish?
- It depends.

260
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,233
An old tract
about the meaning of life?

261
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,199
- No, no.
- A perpetuum mobile?

262
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,396
Spare mel

263
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,318
The relics of Saint Sebastian?

264
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,359
The relics? Tha!'s a good one.

265
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,392
- Where would you find those?
- Seek and you shall find.

266
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,194
Did this Sebastian ever exist?

267
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,279
Maybe.

268
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,354
- Maybe not.
- What are you saying?

269
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,399
I'm saying,
there won't be any money.

270
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,356
- Do you see this hole?
- Nu.

271
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,398
I wanted to pluck a rose blossom...

272
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,192
...for a maiden.
- You should mend ii.

273
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,398
Mend It! Where does one
find the right cloth?

274
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,398
And time? And money?

275
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,397
No money! No time!
Spent it all!

276
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,351
That's how it is then.

277
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,272
He shall eat dust,
and eat eagerly.

278
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,320
I will see what I can do
for you. Doctor.

279
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,392
Never mind.

280
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,278
Ferdinand! My registry!

281
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,193
Ferdinandul

282
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,352
It's not under my pillow!

283
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,238
I have hidden ii somewhere else.

284
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,358
I'm thirsty! Pour me some wine!

285
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,232
Certainly, madam.

286
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,233
Law, medicine, philosophy...

287
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,398
...and sadly even theology...

288
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,319
...I've studied with passionate
resolution.

289
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,391
And stand here now...

290
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,398
...a fool for sure,
no wiser than I was before.

291
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,231
Excuse me.

292
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,393
Everything fleeting
is only a stench!

293
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,354
- Calm down!
- We can't get through with the coffin!

294
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,392
Everyone over here!

295
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,360
I'm here! I'm with you!

296
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,399
Patience, patience! Don't move!

297
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,190
Let the pigs through!

298
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,194
There we go. Come on.

299
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,391
Ida. I need hot water.

300
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,159
What's this “I need”?!
I have to cook now.

301
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,280
In the beginning was the Word...

302
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,278
...the Word...

303
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,392
In the beginning was the Word...

304
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,273
...the Word...

305
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,279
You again! Come in!

306
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,312
In the beginning was the Word...

307
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,318
And the Word was with God.

308
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,155
Do you understand how this is meant?

309
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,272
- No.
- Neither do I.

310
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,320
"In the beginning was the Word..."
Already I'm stuck.

311
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,236
Impossible for me tn rate the word...

312
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,154
...so highly.
- You must translate ii some other way.

313
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,312
Maybe "the thought"?
In the beginning was...

314
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,391
In the beginning
was the thought that acts...

315
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,393
...and creates everything.
- In the beginning was the I.

316
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,316
- Whose "I"?
- Mine.

317
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,318
- You were In the beginning?
- Why not?

318
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,358
- Then we're all doomed.
- I don't believe so.

319
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,192
- Ida!
- That was on purpose!

320
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,391
There you have your water!

321
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,352
Furniture wrecker!
Little termite!

322
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,234
- In the beginning was the Word...
- Such manners! In our home!

323
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,392
- No, you're mistaken.
- In the beginning was the thought...

324
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,398
...that acts and creates everything.

325
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,278
In the beginning was an I.
Listen Io...

326
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,200
...wise little Wagner...

327
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,274
...who nearly bursts
with love for his master.

328
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,278
In the beginning was the thought...

329
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,231
...wise little Wagner...

330
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,193
Yes, wise Little Wagner.
Or the great...

331
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,237
- What are you doing?

332
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,392
- Nothing.
- Stop it.

333
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,198
But It's the latest fashion
in Franrel

334
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,392
I look like a corpse in this colour.

335
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,358
Did you bring what I asked for?

336
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,391
Yes.

337
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,240
Give it In mel There it is.

338
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,357
Thank you.

339
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,198
I hope your brown liquid is good.

340
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,160
- It all depends on the dose.
- As long as it works.

341
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,351
Will you miss me?

342
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,392
Begin The procedure.

343
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,278
Wagner! Will you miss me?

344
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,153
Miss you?

345
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,238
I can't say whether I'll miss you.

346
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,193
Yes or no?

347
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,392
Or would you join me in death?

348
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,200
- Whal:'s that? Stinging nettle?
- It stimulates the vital orga ns.

349
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,353
- And spells the appetite.
- Nu. I won'! miss you.

350
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,238
- Why not?
- I can tell you...

351
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,312
...why I won't miss you.
- Alright.

352
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,313
What are the gentlemen doing”

353
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,240
An abominable stench throughout
the house!

354
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,318
Like a witches' kitchen!

355
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,238
As a consolation I'll drink it, tool

356
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,234
No, you won't.
I'll drink it all myself.

357
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,392
- Where ls my towel?
- Don'! walk banefoot!

358
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,234
What are you dolng here? I'm
not receiving today. I have to go.

359
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,273
A decent gentleman!

360
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,273
Extremely decent!

361
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,356
You forgo! your ring.

362
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,200
As an honest man...

363
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,358
...I felt obliged In return ii.

364
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,358
How did you get In here?
Who let you in?

365
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,238
Idubergal Did you let him in?

366
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,154
- Are you running an open house?
- Thank you, Iduherga.

367
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,320
Decent people mus! keep...

368
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,272
...each other's company,
and not mingle with riffraff.

369
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,392
- Thanks, Iduberga.
- Wagner. why are you shivering?

370
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,396
Get out!

371
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,351
Why no! mnney instead?

372
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,239
- I'd prefer money.
- The Gospel according In John.

373
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,198
- Do you know Greek?
- No.

374
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,238
But I'd always recognise
the Holy Scripture.

375
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,391
How 507

376
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,398
My faith helps.

377
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,358
You hope to flnd
what you're lacking in this hunk?

378
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,238
- What am I lacking?
- I know. A healthy diet.

379
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,318
- For you.
- That won't be necessary.

380
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,233
- Try it.
- If you say so.

381
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,280
I baked It myself,
What is that smell?

382
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,278
- Such a sweet smell!
- Where are you going?

383
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,352
Eat! You'll need it.

384
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,358
How do you know what I'll need?

385
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,391
Eat, eat.

386
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,232
Hemlock]

387
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,392
- From the apothecary next door?
- None of your business.

388
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,232
That was mine!

389
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,352
This is impossible.

390
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,239
You cannot dle here!
What is more, I wanted In go.

391
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,194
You are alive? Interesting...

392
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,391
But the poison... How the devil?I

393
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,318
The devil?
Stupid wenches call me that...

394
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,398
...but It's not who I am.
- Who are you then?

395
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,358
If I knew...

396
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,153
What use would it be tn you?

397
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,318
I have a certain interest.

398
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,351
In what?

399
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,273
The eternal dilemma.

400
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,351
Oh. no. nnl

401
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,193
Out of the question,...

402
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,240
...the waiting list is too long.

403
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,278
Too many interested parties...

404
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,273
Who else is on the list?

405
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,352
Tell me. It'll remain between us.

406
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,392
Or are you deceiving me again?

407
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,232
I speak only the naked truth.
Our theatre director...

408
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,239
I thought so.

409
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,393
- Your rector.
- An idiot! Who else?

410
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,272
The local coffin maker.

411
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,396
Don't touch!

412
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,358
A monkey!

413
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,391
A monkey!

414
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,193
You're lying!

415
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,356
A monkey on the moon!

416
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,312
Then, the butcher,
the music teacher.

417
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:19,196
- Pfellferll
- Yes. exactly. A freemason.

418
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,352
- That's plenty.
- Exactly.

419
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,193
Itnld you.

420
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,311
What are you looking for?

421
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,316
You stink like a corpse!

422
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,192
What a stench!

423
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,200
I don't smell anything,
but if you say so.

424
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,194
What shall we do?
Should we air the room?

425
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,352
- But how exactly shall we go about it?
- We'll just walk out.

426
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,313
A stroll with you, Doctor, ls an honour
and a reward.

427
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,200
By way of saying thanks
I'd like to show you something.

428
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,352
I know everything you could show me
in this town.

429
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:07,360
And what we do know
is of no use tn us.

430
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:11,359
Ergo: what we don't know
will be of use to us.

431
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,238
Give me that! Now explain...

432
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,358
...how it's possible
after such a lethal dose...

433
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,351
...that you should still be allve?
Incredible!

434
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,398
Oh, now it starts! I'm dying!

435
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,358
The spirit of denial wlll survive
this world.

436
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,352
- This ls the way out.
- Not an ounce of sympathy...

437
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,192
- What?
- ...for your companion!

438
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,234
Your hemlock was too strong
for my weak stomach.

439
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,351
Thank you.

440
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,396
Thanks for what?

441
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,232
- When will you be back?
- Let me do it!

442
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:51,281
- Why rnust we lock It all the tlme?
- I'll take care of it.

443
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,239
- Thank you, Iduberga.
- Ida!

444
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,352
Turn the key to the right!

445
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,312
- To the left!
- What has got into you?

446
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,278
You seem to cause turmoil.

447
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,314
Flrst Wagner, then Ida.
What is going on?

448
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,358
The gate is broken.

449
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,278
Godforsaken corner!
Someone is always getting stuck!

450
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,311
- Your timber ls here.
- Pu! it there.

451
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,351
- You must pay for It.
- How do we get out?

452
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,352
- Patience! God was also patient.
- Is the world too cramped for you?

453
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,392
What are you all doing here?
You have no business here!

454
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,396
Where ls your compassion?
Everyone musk live somehow.

455
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,232
And survive. But I'm no savinur.

456
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,199
What do you know how to do?

457
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,194
- Chatter.
- A good remedy.

458
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,193
Maybe, but remedies
are no! my speciality.

459
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:53,241
But there is one simple remedy.

460
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,398
I! helps one In live and to survive.

461
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,358
- That way, damn it!
- No, you have to go that way!

462
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,351
So you know...

463
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:08,154
...a remedy that needs no gold,
no magic.

464
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,280
- What ls it?
- Workyour plot...

465
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,318
- Dlg, plough...
- Rise early!

466
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,357
- Rise early! Mllk the cows...
- Feed the cattle...

467
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,351
Feed yourself on the purest fare...

468
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,273
Muck out the stables.
No fear of dirt, or manure.

469
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,312
My stomach! I have to go to...

470
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,278
So narrow a Ille would never
suit me.

471
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,313
I can't hold it any longer.

472
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,279
Not here! We're not alone!

473
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,271
I can't hold it any longer.

474
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,360
It's your hemlock's fault. Cover mel

475
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,233
Not next to the church!

476
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,273
True.

477
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,316
Better inside the church.

478
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,392
Wait here. I'll he bark shortly.

479
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,318
Excuse me: I'm afraid
I don't know you.

480
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,280
Soon we will let you in on the deal.

481
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,396
He has such a weak stomach.

482
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,398
What are you doing here?

483
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,272
Tell me. then. what is the matter?

484
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,318
I know hlm. You have made
the right decision.

485
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,159
What do you mean?

486
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,357
Reputable men an reputably...

487
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,352
...contract signature, as is proper.

488
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,239
Excuse me, can I be of service?

489
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,396
And...

490
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,198
...Is he really the...?
- He is.

491
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:20,157
And how about you?

492
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,314
I'm number 150 on the waiting list.

493
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,234
Good. What number am I?

494
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,233
I could give you mine.

495
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,278
No, tha nks.

496
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,318
- Surely you don't believe In God?
- Vanity of va niiies, boredom...

497
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,358
...the entire world is a failure.

498
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,396
But why do you believe...

499
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,396
...i n Sata n?

500
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,193
Where is the logic here?

501
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,358
If gnnd doesn'! exist...

502
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:00,194
...then neither can evil. Right?

503
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,312
No, wrong. Good doesn't exist...

504
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,200
...but evil does!

505
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,153
- He has answered you.
- What are you talking about!

506
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,279
Your turn. Professor.

507
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,198
Good does not exist, but evil does.

508
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,318
- Doctor!
- Do you know what you just said?

509
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,392
I'm here!

510
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,153
You're not alone.

511
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,391
Let us leave this place!

512
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,199
In the beginning was the deed!

513
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,234
Let's go home, Agathel

514
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,273
In the beginning was the deed?

515
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,278
Thls woman has been following me
for years.

516
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,352
She claims to he my wife.

517
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,194
- In the beginning was the deed.
- Yes, the deed!

518
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,312
- The deed!
- An interesting solution...

519
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,314
I assumed It was meaning.
Or power.

520
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,198
No, meaning results
frnm action...

521
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,358
But... Where are we going?

522
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,316
I just wanted to get rid of that woman.

523
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,236
- What ls this here?
- I don't know myself.

524
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,314
Seems like a good spot
for our philosophical discussion.

525
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,200
This rings a bell.
I was here as a child.

526
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,238
This is what I call real human life!

527
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,312
Here I'm a man, here I dare to be a man!

528
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,313
- Looks more Ilke a slave market!

With such crooked fingers you could

What do you mean by that?

545

It Is you who worries me,
not these women.

A professor, and he still dashes around

00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,396
There she is.

595
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:25,314

...that when the sky farts,
a comet appears.

679

He didn't mean to offend you.

695
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,153
Then he must apologise.

696
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,199
Alright, enough!

697
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,318

00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,398
Although there ls no reason
Io apologise.

700

You must admit this is donkey piss.

701
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,358
- Enough!
- Pure donkey piss.

702
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,357
- He ls drunk. And a soldier!
- A drunken soldier.

703
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:42,238
He should apologise properly!

704
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,318
Then he'd better keep silent.

705
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:49,314
Wine is the blood of the earth.

706
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,318
I'll show hlm
what this blond looks like.

707
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,279
I'm going tn see Margarete.

708
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,318
Let's have one more drink,
then we'll go.

709
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,193
Be quiet, friendly element.

710
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,193
How did he do that?

711
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,318
It ls all a hoax:
all tricks. all lies.

712
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,313
Here is a miracle, sojus! believe.

713
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,352
That's wine? Holy Mary!

714
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:37,199
We drink to your sister,
to beautiful Margaretel

715
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:44,237
Swilll

716
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,158
Someone sald something
interesting Ihere.

717
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,398
Donkey piss!

718
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:59,241
The young man Is again offended!
So fussy]

719
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,272
Leave it! The old man ls too fat
for your short blade!

720
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,351
Doctor, stand your ground!
Stay close to mel

721
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,318
What are you doing?
He has fallen onto my fork!

722
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,351
How clumsy!

723
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,358
L!'s time for us to disappear.

724
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:24,396
But we cannot...

725
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,356
...just diss ppea rl

726
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,158
We must!

727
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,352
- He needs help!
- He's not the first.

728
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:36,391
L!'s you who needs help.

729
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,272
It's good bread, fresh baked.

730
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:56,239
Yes, I see.

731
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,312
- What can I do for you?
- I'm just looking.

732
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:23,281
- Congratulations on your new life!

733
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:30,351
What have you done?I

734
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:32,316
I didn't mean to.
It just happened.

735
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,318
As if the Devil himself
put the fork in my ha nd!

736
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:37,279
It is a mortal sin!

737
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:41,275
If you must be careless with your
own soul, then please think of mine.

738
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,272
One doesn't die of such wounds!

739
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:51,200
So you say, poor boy.

740
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,278
He has likely already dled.
While you are so cold-blended.

741
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,234
Enough! Who started
the whole thing? You or me?

742
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:00,358
You just said it yourself - the Devil.

743
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:02,351
So the question remains open.

744
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,239
You're a clown!

745
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:08,200
A clown? This way!

746
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:11,240
Why didn't you take...

747
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:15,239
..my rl ng?
- The things you worry aboui.

748
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,273
- Vou're laughing?!
- Shall I renounce all laughter...

749
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:20,193
...for you r sa ke?

750
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,233
Just tell me how I can make this right.

751
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,272
- Can you heal his wound?
- No.

752
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,200
Comfor! his kin?

753
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:30,394
No. How big is the family?

754
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:34,279
Only two people, his mother and sister.

755
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,392
A miserable clan.

756
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,239
They've pawned everything.

757
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,238
No doubt in your shop.

758
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,279
There is no one up there!

759
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,273
L!'s draughty here.

760
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:58,352
His sister!

761
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,194
Margaretel What a flower!

762
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,358
I still can't believe that...

763
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:08,232
...she will wither with grief...

764
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,280
...without tasting
the pleasures of life.

765
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,356
Oh, what have you done?I

766
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:27,319
We must help them somehow,
give them mnney...

767
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:30,278
But there is no money In be had.

768
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,198
Can't you help?

769
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:37,397
- What can I...
- Oh, come on!

770
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:41,318
...Glve to them? The things I have
do not belong to me.

771
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:44,272
They could be redeemed
at any moment.

772
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:47,354
What can be dune?

773
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:53,318
- Come!
- Where are you taking me?

774
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,351
Come!

775
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,392
Hang the tablecloth over there.

776
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,351
L!'ll dry more quickly.

777
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:04,351
There they are.

778
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:07,279
There she is: unbelievable!

779
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:14,200
What you can't count on,
you can't believe is true.

780
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,272
You gave me only the light things.

781
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:20,392
Make sure to hang
the dress properly.

782
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:23,312
Or your mother will tell us
both off!

783
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,279
She ls so strict
in everything she does.

784
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:31,359
- What are you dolng here?
- The wound was fatal after all.

785
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:35,234
- Your brother.
- What do you mean, "my bro!her"7

786
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,232
This is my brother?

787
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:42,192
But he is dead... Mama!

788
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,313
This is Valenti n?

789
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,358
I don't recognise him at all!

790
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,279
They say it's my brother.

791
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,278
Yes, this is your brother.

792
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:19,356
Take him inside.

793
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:34,234
- We have to do something.
- To procure the pretty thing for you?

794
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:37,154
Stopjoking! I'm not in the mood.

795
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,312
L!'s indeed narrow... My God...

796
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:43,396
Put it in an angle, fool!

797
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:46,398
Flnd some money for them!
Or I'll inform on you.

798
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,312
Alright. I can't watch you suffer!

799
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:51,390
You're forcing me to use
my nest egg.

800
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,391
That's that.

801
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,398
You'll flnd me at home.
You know the way.

802
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:00,238
I'll be in the cellar.

803
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:03,232
- Doctor!
- Where are you?

804
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:05,313
Here!

805
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,278
- What's that smell?
- The smell of misery.

806
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:38,398
What a heap! Is this your nest egg?

807
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,239
Help yourself!

808
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:46,390
So what dues gold smell like?

809
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,316
Gold?

810
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,319
Ll ke sweet cream.
Like a cake with whipped cream.

811
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,396
- Are you hungry again?
- Yes!

812
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,351
Careful! My wings!

813
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,312
I have to get a closer look at you...

814
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,392
...at your wings, your arse.

815
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:06,391
Why not just cut me up?

816
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:10,234
Wagner would be delighted.
A magnificent autopsy specimen!

817
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:13,234
- Mr. Faust, this Isn't Ilke you.
- No, ii isn't like me.

818
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,238
There should be a box up there
somewhere.

819
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:20,196
You keep all this to yourself,
but we need mnney.

820
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:22,238
My old friend Tacitus.

821
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,392
- I've found something!
- Pardon me?

822
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:28,312
Keep looking, keep looking!

823
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:30,313
You want to make the whole world happy!

824
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,274
- Some klnd of bones!
- Coins!

825
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,398
- A shower of gold!
- Where is the box?

826
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,320
Come to me, my Zeus!
I'll be your Danae!

827
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:44,234
- You gabber! Have you found something?
- My aunt's brown purse...

828
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:47,274
fallen as if from heaven!
- You're tricking mel

829
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:51,273
- The Devll doesn't have aunts!
- For the Lord, all things are possible.

830
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,160
Let me out of here!

831
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,312
No, I have to change my clothes!

832
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,280
Me, too! Hurry up!
I wan! In get this over with.

833
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:01,273
- Then you go ahead.
- No...

834
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:04,240
...you go, my dear friend,
and I'll wait outside.

835
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:14,195
Today we bid farewell
to our beloved Valentin.

836
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:19,321
The Lord summons no! only the old...

837
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:24,278
...but sometimes the young as well.

838
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:28,313
His earthly life was brief.

839
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:32,236
But he wlll be remembered
as a loyal son...

840
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,233
...a caring brother,
and a reliable friend.

841
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:37,240
- Where are you going?
- I need In see your mistress.

842
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:39,233
- Do you need help?
- Go, go!

843
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:41,193
L!'s highly confidential.

844
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:47,192
What are you sniffing around
here for!

845
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,233
Frau Emmerich!
You have a visitor.

846
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:53,280
- Good day, Frau Emmerich!
- I do not wish to see anyone.

847
01:00:53,350 --> 01:00:56,354
It will be of the greatest Interest
to you, dear madam.

848
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:59,272
Have you taken lemon balm?

849
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:05,200
It won't help.
I have something better for you.

850
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:08,240
- What?
- A sedative you know well.

851
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:11,360
When your husband passed,
he Isl! a tidy sum.

852
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,192
You were comforted rather quickly.

853
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:16,193
- I have children.
- You have survived...

854
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,352
...even the unborn chlld
you killed in your womb.

855
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:21,278
A true friend gave you a ring...

856
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,273
...and you immediately
forgot your grief.

857
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:26,154
Caressing gold is a good cure.

858
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:28,238
I have no gold, as you well know.

859
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:31,351
Now once again you do.

860
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,398
I was asked Io give this to you.

861
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:42,240
- By whom?
- A good person...

862
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,238
...with a big heart. An angel.

863
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:47,358
Or perhaps a villain, a scoundrel.

864
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,311
What are you saying?

865
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:52,394
Just take what your
patron saint has given.

866
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:55,318
Only the Lord Gnd sends patron saints.

867
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,312
- NM necessa rl ly.
- The Lord giveth. and the Lord ta keih.

868
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:01,234
Man has two hands. One taketh,
the other one giveth.

869
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,199
What about you?

870
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:11,356
It has nothing to do with me.

871
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,153
What's wrong?I

872
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:43,238
He struggles along like
a decrepit old horse!

873
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:45,233
What, what, what?I

874
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:48,272
Tell me already!

875
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:52,358
Did she accept it?

876
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:00,274
She did. But personally,
I would n't have given it to her.

877
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:03,278
Why not?

878
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:05,396
I don'¢ like any of this.

879
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:08,199
You are moved...

880
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:11,238
...by pure lust.

881
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:14,312
Although It ls hidden
behind a mask of nobleness.

882
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:18,200
What noblenessl There they are already!

883
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:19,396
I'm ridden with guilt.

884
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:21,356
Tha!'s also quite noble.

885
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:30,356
What's the hurry?

886
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,200
One is rushed. even tu the grave.

887
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:37,353
Tlme ls on the wane.
Death is never a welcome guest.

888
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:40,192
One always hurries Io he rid of him.

889
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:14,312
This is taking it too far, Doctor!

890
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:18,155
- What are you dolng here?
- Listen...

891
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,398
...this is not my crime, but yours.

892
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:27,358
Oh dear, you've been offended!

893
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:40,358
Attention! Close ranksl

894
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:55,193
But we have no money.

895
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:59,397
Now we do. Now everything
will be different.

896
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:08,273
We won't let our heroes be disgraced!

897
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,392
Stop it! End this nonsense!

898
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:13,318
There are no heroes here!

899
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:16,318
This is a private affair!

900
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:19,234
Onwards! I'll lead the way I

901
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:28,234
Go get 'em!

902
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,318
Splendid!

903
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:40,232
Hands off! She's not yours!

904
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:43,273
What is the Professor doing here?

905
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:46,314
He's not a member of the family.

906
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:30,313
Boring!

907
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:33,193
I barely knew him.

908
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,396
He was always fighting
in SOME War DY Othér.

909
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:40,390
I rarely saw him.

910
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:16,159
From the earth we came...

911
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:18,358
...and so we shall return.
Earth tn earth...

912
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:21,318
...ashes tn ashes. dust to dust.

913
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:32,159
My sympathies. Frau Emmerich.

914
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:45,313
Be careful with the cross!

915
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:47,396
- Are you going to the wa ke?
- No.

916
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:55,193
A peculiar girl.

917
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:56,351
May I accompany you,
Frau Emmerich?

918
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:58,351
- Is that hlm?
- No.

919
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:05,273
So who is it then?

920
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:08,351
An eternal wanderer...

921
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:12,273
...who reams the hills
and vales of life.

922
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:27,379
Altmayerl

923
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:30,454
Where are you? Let's go together!

924
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:58,418
- All of them are buried here...

925
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:02,256
...my entire family.
- The graves seem somewhat neglected.

926
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:04,298
Everything will he different now.

927
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,376
What a naughty old man!

928
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:10,333
Could you introduce me to him?

929
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:12,492
- Absolutely nut.
- Why not!

930
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:16,499
My companion is a scholar.

931
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:19,491
A misanthrope.

932
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:23,300
He lacks the lightness of being
that we naturally possess.

933
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:26,458
- What Is he dolng here?
- He is suffering.

934
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:30,332
Everything revolves
in its little circle.

935
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:32,496
I don'¢ like any of this.

936
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:34,491
I'll see you home.

937
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:37,371
Wolves roam these parts.

938
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:42,257
For everyone knows exactly
what will lead him to hell.

939
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,496
- What about my mother?
- She's having a conversation.

940
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:45,491
What?

941
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:48,452
You don't know what leads a man to hell?

942
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:54,491
I'm so tired.

943
01:10:56,370 --> 01:10:58,372
We're nearly Ihere.

944
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:00,452
But nobody wants to go to hell.

945
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,338
Everyone presumes hell ls only
for the bad, not the good.

946
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:04,491
And that is a mistake.

947
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:07,412
What plant might I gladden you with?

948
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:14,257
Celery? Parsley?
Perhaps mandrake root?

949
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:17,452
There Is no mandrake root
round here.

950
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:21,374
- You should be glad! Oh, a burdock!
- Thank you.

951
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:25,290
Can you not walk faster?
I have to get to my guests.

952
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:27,498
Do you know where mandrake root grows?

953
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,378
- No.
- We'd better ta ke the little path.

954
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:33,373
- Why?

955
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,379
This path is better.

956
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:37,498
It ls a steep path
but it is quite pretty.

957
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,332
- Yes, It truly ls.
- Professor!

958
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:44,378
- I'm over here!
- I can hear that.

959
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:52,297
It grows below gallows
or near bonfire pits...

960
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:55,339
Blueberries!

961
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:59,413
...Bonfires In which witches
were burned.

962
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:02,300
- I'm tired.
- We can have a rest.

963
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:03,451
No, let's keep going.

964
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:06,452
Women are weatherproof:
one may only admire (hem.

965
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,298
Why are you so frightened?
You're not a witch.

966
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:12,260
- Where are the two of them going?
- They cannot run away.

967
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:14,293
All roads lead to town.

968
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:15,496
And what is this here?

969
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:18,458
Verbena.

970
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:21,456
Ora lily.

971
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:26,293
Are you really a professor?

972
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,452
And a baccalaureate,
and a doctor, and so on.

973
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,492
But you're not
well versed in botany.

974
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:45,372
Quite so.

975
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:47,491
Autumn is coming.

976
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:52,492
So in what things are you well versed?

977
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:01,378
The order of the universe...

978
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:04,293
...the trajectories of the planets...

979
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:08,373
...the transmutation of metal into gold.

980
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:14,293
What plan! is this?

981
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,413
I think...

982
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:20,412
...It's chickweed.
- The things you know.

983
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:22,413
Why are only women sen! In the stake?

984
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:25,494
I know that my chatter
can never entertain a man like you.

985
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:28,378
- But not men?
- You'll be the firs! man to burn.

986
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:31,496
You should trust yourself more.

987
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:34,299
Fine by mel

988
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:37,413
I dream of the day...

989
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,451
...when I'm finally burned.

990
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:45,493
The day that everybody
is burned...

991
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:49,458
...regardless of sex...

992
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:53,300
...age, rank or merit.

993
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:57,452
That's what I call equality.

994
01:13:58,290 --> 01:13:59,451
I had a dream about my brother today.

995
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:04,418
He seemed different.
We talked...

996
01:14:05,410 --> 01:14:07,299
...for a long time.

997
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,293
You know so much.

998
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:16,492
What does death do to a person?
Does he die completely?

999
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:21,498
Science argues that death exists.

1000
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:28,340
- But Ilfe gives the same answer.
- Yes, tha!'s true.

1001
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:32,413
So what do we need your science for?

1002
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:36,300
It's something to do to fill the void.

1003
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:41,380
You, say, probably enjoy
knitting in your free time?

1004
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:53,333
Yes, I do.

1005
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:55,492
Science is something like knitting.

1006
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:03,333
I'm driven by great things.

1007
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:05,412
Thls earthly round
is ton cramped for me.

1008
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:08,452
I can neither better
nor convert my fellow men.

1009
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,418
- Wherever are they?
- They're just talking and talking.

1010
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,332
- What about?
- About life and death.

1011
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:18,458
Death is death.

1012
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:22,414
Yes, death still exists.

1013
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:24,496
But soon ii will disappear.

1014
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:29,300
- What ls that supposed to mean?
- I'm speaking of the future.

1015
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:31,418
But some people are already
on the right path.

1016
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:33,379
And there won't be any unhappy
people there?

1017
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:36,414
No. The unhappy are dangerous.
Quite dangerous.

1018
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:38,451
Doctor! I'm over here!

1019
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:40,451
Margaretel It is late!

1020
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,411
Come! What are you dolng
sitting there?

1021
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:48,453
Is this a pleasure garden or what?
We must go home!

1022
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:51,492
- I'm coming, Mother!
- Quickly, quickly!

1023
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:56,338
Why are you running round
with your skirt raised?

1024
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,492
- What an innocent child!

1025
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:00,456
- Don't touch her!
- No groping!

1026
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:03,452
Thank you. Goodbye,
my guardian angel.

1027
01:16:04,290 --> 01:16:05,496
- I'll be thinking of you.
- You're shameless!

1028
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:08,338
Up here it's safer, isn't it?

1029
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:10,412
Why are you roaming about?
Think of your brother!

1030
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:13,414
He lies In his grave,
and what are you doing?

1031
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:17,300
- I thlnk only of him!
- I know what you're thinking about!

1032
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:20,374
You Ilttle whore!
It's a disgrace! A disgrace!

1033
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:24,458
What will people say?

1034
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:28,458
One should never joke with women.

1035
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:38,498
Ma ma, wait!

1036
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:52,339
That wasn't exactly timely.

1037
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:55,413
Who is he anyway?

1038
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:58,293
Why did you bring the mother here?

1039
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:00,416
I! was lime.

1040
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:03,418
You begln In secret, with just one.
And then another.

1041
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,456
And soon the whole town will have you!

1042
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:09,294
You know where this will lead you?

1043
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,372
What are you dolng here?
Come with us!

1044
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:15,299
No, I don't know!

1045
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:21,491
What binds a woman tn a man?

1046
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:24,496
Don't you know?

1047
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:26,456
No, I have no idea.

1048
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:35,456
Three things...

1049
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:48,292
...money...

1050
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:50,339
...lush and a shared household.

1051
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:56,298
That has a cynical ring.

1052
01:17:57,330 --> 01:17:58,491
Cynical?

1053
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:02,340
L!'s strange to hear that frnm you.

1054
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:04,293
Yet another moraliser.

1055
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:09,499
I have the rlght tn accuse others
of being cynical...

1056
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:14,335
...because I myself am different.

1057
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:17,379
Clean.

1058
01:18:19,290 --> 01:18:20,451
Pure.

1059
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:25,381
You - clean, pure?
Who told you that?

1060
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:29,500
Ever since Eve was tempted,
the world has not been pure.

1061
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,332
It wasn't I who tempted her,
but a distant ancestor.

1062
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:34,339
A snake just like you.

1063
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:45,492
Good day!

1064
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:49,292
- Are we headed the right way?
- Where are you going?

1065
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:51,372
- To Paris.
- To Paris? Paris is that way.

1066
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:53,411
Get in!

1067
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:56,418
- Would you llke to go to Paris?
- That's the last thing I need.

1068
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:58,373
- Show me the way.
- I'm tired.

1069
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:00,369
Let's ride with him for a bit.

1070
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:01,337
Let's ride with him for a bit.

1071
01:19:03,370 --> 01:19:04,451
Someone is lying in here, snoring.

1072
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,299
Doctor! Climb in...

1073
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:10,498
...or the best seats will be taken,
as so often happens in life.

1074
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:12,451
Get in, get in!

1075
01:19:13,370 --> 01:19:14,496
Come on!

1076
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:19,496
Hey, careful!

1077
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:27,492
Lousy Krauisl

1078
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:30,412
Let's be off! Straight ahead!

1079
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:37,373
I want to get out.
It smells here!

1080
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:41,294
- The man stinks terribly.
- Maybe it's a woman.

1081
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:44,293
You'd know better than I.

1082
01:19:44,370 --> 01:19:45,451
Your little doll quickly took the bait.

1083
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,332
How I'd love to spit In your
impudent face!

1084
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:56,293
But I still have need of you...

1085
01:19:57,370 --> 01:20:00,374
...perhaps.
- Together we're strong.

1086
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:04,421
We accomplished a lot today. We made
the family of the murdered man happy.

1087
01:20:04,450 --> 01:20:07,260
- Indeed! We made them happy.

1088
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:10,340
You talked to Ma rga rete in private.

1089
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:12,458
- Mind you, thanks to me.
- It was too brief.

1090
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:16,373
Too brief?I

1091
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:21,418
Do you wan! to be with her for longer?

1092
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:25,413
Then it's called seduction.

1093
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:28,380
Good morning!
Selifan, give me my jacket! And teal

1094
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:30,339
And so it is.

1095
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:33,339
But I want to all the same!

1096
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:35,333
How boring!

1097
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:38,414
I was sleeping.

1098
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:47,419
Selifan, where ls my jacket?
We have guests.

1099
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:52,418
- Is he a madman?
- ND, he's Russian.

1100
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:55,260
- How do I approach her?
- You'll have to impress the girl!

1101
01:20:55,370 --> 01:20:58,294
But how?

1102
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:02,299
Show her that you can read her
secret thoughts.

1103
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:05,340
- Glrls like that sort of thlng.
- Stop it!

1104
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,372
Even you won't be able to flnd
nu! her secret thoughts.

1105
01:21:14,330 --> 01:21:16,458
Selifa n, kick them nut!

1106
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:18,451
Stop] We've arrived!

1107
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:47,300
It's mass you need to stay the masses.

1108
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:49,451
Come on, Doctor!

1109
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,380
You're not yet man enough
to deal with those devils.

1110
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:57,497
- What do you mean “not yet"?
- You must learn to trust yourself.

1111
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,412
- Nonsense!
- Your desire to live is great...

1112
01:22:02,290 --> 01:22:04,418
...but your strength Is small.
- Were you serious...

1113
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:07,452
...about reading her thoughts?

1114
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:15,375
- Even you can't do that.
- I can't. But her confessor can.

1115
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:21,293
I'm not a confessor.

1116
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:24,332
- You could become one.
- Me? Her confessor?

1117
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:26,498
- I feel you have strength.
- You're mocking mel

1118
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:29,452
I'm not mocking you.
I have a plan.

1119
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:33,418
When was the last tlme
you went to church?

1120
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,379
Last year.

1121
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:38,414
Margarete goes a little more regularly.

1122
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,293
Nearly every day.

1123
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:44,418
Nearly every day?
So what?

1124
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:48,339
- How Is that going to help me?
- You're hungry, too?

1125
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:51,334
Everyone here ls starving.
Continue fighting. The world is big.

1126
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,456
And our priest...

1127
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:01,496
...is he also one of your clients?

1128
01:23:22,370 --> 01:23:24,293
Well, then.

1129
01:23:35,370 --> 01:23:37,293
See you later.

1130
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:49,333
Rather tasty.

1131
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:52,380
I did my best, as always.

1132
01:23:52,450 --> 01:23:55,294
Such pretty things.
Where did you get the money for them?

1133
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:59,293
Your student...

1134
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:02,340
Your student pawned off
some of your lectures on somebody.

1135
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:06,378
Although I have no Idea
why anyone would want them.

1136
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:08,339
One doesn't have
to know everylhi ng, Ida.

1137
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:10,418
One more thing. Professor.

1138
01:24:11,490 --> 01:24:15,290
There was someone here
for you, a professor.

1139
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:18,420
He wanted to invite you to his lecture.

1140
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:21,372
I asked hlm, "Who are you?
What do you wa nt?"

1141
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:24,380
He said:
"I wa nt to see Professor Faust."

1142
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:26,418
- Thanks, Ida.
- You're welcome.

1143
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:29,414
I sald: "You have no business here.
Go to the unisity."

1144
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:31,451
"University"I

1145
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:34,338
That's what I said, "Unisity."

1146
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:37,418
- "He's there day and night." I said.

1147
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:42,301
- Yes, it's all so terribly horrible.
- Decent gentlemen sleep at home...

1148
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,378
...in their own beds.

1149
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:56,451
Katharinal

1150
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:03,300
I'm busy!

1151
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:51,491
I'll save her.

1152
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:02,496
What do you want, Frau Hagemann?

1153
01:26:04,290 --> 01:26:05,451
I want some bread.

1154
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:13,458
- Where were you?
- Everybody has been waiting.

1155
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:16,333
What did she tell you, Adelhelma?

1156
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:22,373
Where is your mother, Gretchen?

1157
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:26,496
There she is.

1158
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:31,412
Where have you been?
They're going to eat everything up!

1159
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,378
Margarete. where are you going?

1160
01:26:58,250 --> 01:26:59,456
I'm going outside.

1161
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:30,456
There he is.

1162
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:56,418
Where can I make a donation?

1163
01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:00,416
It's you! I haven't seen you
in a long while.

1164
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:04,333
How large is the donation?

1165
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:07,372
It's not small.

1166
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:10,414
How hard the uphill road would be...

1167
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:13,259
...in silence, sweat, and effort...

1168
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:15,452
...if every now and then we did not meet
3 TCSS [IPOD DUI' Wiy...

1169
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:19,334
...that nodded to us:
"Look, I'm in bloom!"

1170
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:21,491
Please, come with me.

1171
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:25,340
What would we da without...

1172
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:27,373
...the generous hands
of our benefactors.

1173
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:30,454
He who has no hand makes no fist.

1174
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:42,373
Elsa! I forgot my basket
in your house!

1175
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,373
I'll bring it by later!

1176
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:03,300
There she ls. What a coincidence!
No, it's no coincidence!

1177
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:05,498
I must speak with you. Don't be afraid!

1178
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:07,491
I despise everything coarse.

1179
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:10,412
I know how you feel.

1180
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:12,379
I was there at the cemetery.

1181
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:14,452
- Didn't you see me?
- Let me pass!

1182
01:29:15,490 --> 01:29:17,413
I was Ihere.

1183
01:29:17,490 --> 01:29:19,413
I'm so happy today!

1184
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:24,261
It's such a happy, important day!

1185
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:32,294
Do you think he ls Faust?
He isn't Faust! I am Faust!

1186
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:35,418
He stole all his ideas from mel

1187
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:38,418
- He ls a usurper!
- What did he say?

1188
01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:42,260
Yes, I'm little Wagner.

1189
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:44,492
I am the great Wagner!

1190
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:48,379
- We believe you.
- The very great Wagner!

1191
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:52,493
- Shall I take your measurements?
- I am the great Wagner!

1192
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:57,380
The very great Wagner. I am Faust.

1193
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:02,293
I am Faust.

1194
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:07,299
The great Wagner.

1195
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:09,412
- The very great Wagner.
- Yes.

1196
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:12,378
- I am Faust.
- Yes...

1197
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:14,373
...I believe you.

1198
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:16,413
Yes, of course.
I believe you.

1199
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:23,496
I can prove it to you.

1200
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:25,496
I have...

1201
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,378
I can prove I! if you don't believe me.

1202
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:31,458
I've done it!

1203
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:37,420
I mixed the essential oils...

1204
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:40,378
...of asparagus and dandelion...

1205
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:42,492
...with a hyena's liver.

1206
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:45,492
And thus I created...

1207
01:30:52,370 --> 01:30:54,338
...a homunculus.

1208
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:58,333
I mixed...

1209
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:03,373
...the essential oils of asparagus...

1210
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:05,413
...and dandelion...

1211
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:08,496
...with a hyena's liver.

1212
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:12,459
...Mixed I! with a hyena's...

1213
01:31:14,450 --> 01:31:16,339
...liver.

1214
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:22,295
I mixed the essential olls of asparagus
and dandelion.

1215
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:29,379
What are you doing?

1216
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:31,456
A humunculusl An Ubermenschl

1217
01:31:33,290 --> 01:31:35,418
A manmade man!

1218
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:38,491
Show her what you can dnl

1219
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:42,496
Look. Margaretel

1220
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:47,338
Look! Say something to her!

1221
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:53,418
Let me go!

1222
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:55,491
Help! Help!

1223
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,372
My peace is gone...

1224
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:32,418
...my heart is sore...

1225
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:35,298
...I'll never find it...

1226
01:32:35,370 --> 01:32:36,496
...Oh, nevermore.

1227
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:49,416
Where are you?

1228
01:32:51,290 --> 01:32:53,372
Where are you? Where are you?

1229
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:48,491
Yes, please enter.

1230
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:55,492
Dear Lord,
forgive me my tainted thoughts.

1231
01:33:58,490 --> 01:34:00,413
I feel so alone.

1232
01:34:03,450 --> 01:34:05,418
And I do not love my mother.

1233
01:34:10,330 --> 01:34:12,253
But she doesn't love me, either.

1234
01:34:12,490 --> 01:34:15,300
I know I'm a had daughter.

1235
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:17,496
And Gnd will punish me.

1236
01:34:19,330 --> 01:34:21,332
But her make-up...

1237
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:23,299
...the powder on her forehead...

1238
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:25,299
...her had breath.

1239
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:30,334
Dear Lord, forgive me and
help me.

1240
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:34,335
Forgive me my sins.

1241
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,491
You?

1242
01:35:06,370 --> 01:35:09,294
- I met your assistant.
- Did you really?

1243
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:15,335
He is somewhat nervous. your student.

1244
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:18,413
Yes, he is a philosopher.

1245
01:35:20,290 --> 01:35:21,416
May I tell you something?

1246
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:24,292
You needn't reproach yourself.

1247
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:26,492
Take me, for example.
I didn'! love my mother.

1248
01:35:28,330 --> 01:35:30,298
Ilound everything about
her nauseating.

1249
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:33,452
Her red-painted cheeks.

1250
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:36,492
The powder on her forehead.
Her foul breath.

1251
01:35:38,370 --> 01:35:40,293
But that ls a sin.
One must love one's mother.

1252
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:43,340
ND...
One day she died suddenly.

1253
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:45,492
She choked on A piece of cake.

1254
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:49,418
And died instantly.

1255
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:58,298
Can you imagine?

1256
01:35:58,370 --> 01:36:00,293
To die from a piece of cake!

1257
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:02,418
With whipped cream.

1258
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:05,498
If you asked me today whether...

1259
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:09,490
...I'd wanted her dead then...

1260
01:36:10,330 --> 01:36:12,298
...I'd have tn admit...

1261
01:36:12,490 --> 01:36:15,300
...that yes, I did.

1262
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:23,412
- Do you believe in God?

1263
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:25,496
Who today has the rlght to say,
"I believe in God"'I

1264
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:30,298
Me.

1265
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:36,294
God Is love.
But love knows no obligations.

1266
01:36:36,370 --> 01:36:37,496
You don't have to love your mother.

1267
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:47,299
Are you a mind-reader?

1268
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:49,379
You're able to read the book of life.

1269
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:51,418
Not the hook of life...

1270
01:36:51,490 --> 01:36:53,458
...but, perhaps, the book
of one particular person.

1271
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:04,333
There is a custom...

1272
01:37:05,370 --> 01:37:07,338
...to pray for the deceased
for forty days...

1273
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:09,456
...while holding
something in your hand...

1274
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:12,496
...that was his.

1275
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:16,378
I've never heard of that.

1276
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:18,496
No, there is such a custom.

1277
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:21,332
Doctor, I'm leaving.

1278
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:23,253
Everyone can do it...

1279
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:26,411
...except for murderers.

1280
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:33,379
Would you like to pray
for my brother?

1281
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:35,333
He gave this tn me.

1282
01:37:35,410 --> 01:37:37,412
What a likeness!

1283
01:37:42,370 --> 01:37:44,418
Farewell.

1284
01:37:47,490 --> 01:37:49,413
I saw it with my own eyes.

1285
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:52,418
It was the one who kept hiding
behind the fat man.

1286
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:55,413
It couldn't have been anyone else,
Frau Emmerich!

1287
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,411
Come here!

1288
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:10,372
I know who killed your brother.

1289
01:38:11,330 --> 01:38:13,253
Do you want to know?

1290
01:38:15,290 --> 01:38:16,451
I! was Faust who did ii.

1291
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:28,452
Katharina! Please bring me my cape!

1292
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:43,339
My sympathies.

1293
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:47,301
Take a rlght at the south gate.
I'll show you the way.

1294
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:52,416
You?

1295
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:57,412
Do come in.

1296
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:02,490
Do come in.

1297
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:06,494
Have a seai.

1298
01:39:08,330 --> 01:39:10,378
Have a seai.

1299
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:13,293
Sit down.

1300
01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:16,334
I moved the bed next to the window.
For the light... I'm reading.

1301
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:18,458
- I have to ask you something.
- Yes, go ahead.

1302
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:20,490
- Something peculiar.
- You can ask me anything.

1303
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:24,458
- Please excuse me.
- Go on, ask me.

1304
01:39:27,490 --> 01:39:29,333
What is this?

1305
01:39:29,450 --> 01:39:31,339
A bellows.

1306
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:33,376
Yes.

1307
01:39:34,450 --> 01:39:36,498
- And this?
- A retort...

1308
01:39:37,330 --> 01:39:39,332
...for distilling mercury.

1309
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:43,458
Is that all you wanted to ask me?

1310
01:39:45,490 --> 01:39:47,458
Word has it...

1311
01:39:49,330 --> 01:39:51,332
- No... You know...
- What do I know?

1312
01:40:58,410 --> 01:41:00,333
Good bye!

1313
01:41:09,290 --> 01:41:10,416
Good bye!

1314
01:41:15,290 --> 01:41:16,451
Was ii you who killed my brother?

1315
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:20,413
Yes, I killed him.

1316
01:41:48,450 --> 01:41:50,418
What do you want?

1317
01:41:50,490 --> 01:41:52,458
But on the list it says "two rugs."

1318
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:54,416
What rugs?

1319
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:56,379
Where are my Persian rugs?

1320
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:58,452
I! seems you picked them up yesterday.

1321
01:41:59,450 --> 01:42:01,498
The lady would Ilke to redeem her
Dutch chest.

1322
01:42:02,330 --> 01:42:03,411
But it is full of fleas!

1323
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:06,300
Out of the way! Three rugs...

1324
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:08,412
...and 22 percent In Interest.
- What 22 percent interest!!

1325
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:12,497
- What about my flute clock?
With the Handel sarabande?

1326
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:15,332
The beautiful clock goes back.
I love Handel.

1327
01:42:15,410 --> 01:42:17,299
Wait] We have tn...

1328
01:42:18,290 --> 01:42:19,416
Where is my flute clock?

1329
01:42:19,490 --> 01:42:21,492
Oh, Ferdinand! Tick it off!

1330
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:23,491
- One Christ.
- One chest?

1331
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:27,413
- One Christ. It goes over there.
- Somebody stole the clock.

1332
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:32,452
- How many were there?
- Five vases.

1333
01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:35,373
- We're doomed.
- I know.

1334
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:51,372
- We've been found nut!
- By whom?

1335
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:54,412
The girl told me I was
the murderer.

1336
01:42:55,330 --> 01:42:57,332
You have been found out,
not me.

1337
01:42:58,450 --> 01:43:00,452
Does this mean she came tn see you?

1338
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:05,294
I hope you used the opportunity?

1339
01:43:06,290 --> 01:43:08,418
It ls not my nature
to use such opportunities.

1340
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:12,460
Stupid! You won't get
another such chance.

1341
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:16,453
You only wasted tlme
if you denied it all.

1342
01:43:17,410 --> 01:43:19,412
How do you know that
I denied it all?

1343
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:22,414
You are the incessant Ilar.
I always tell the truth.

1344
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:25,300
Is that 507 Well, never mind.

1345
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:27,332
It must have been the mother
who found out.

1346
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:30,459
Take ii easy.

1347
01:43:31,290 --> 01:43:33,452
So far you haven't been arrested.
Don't worry.

1348
01:43:34,290 --> 01:43:36,292
We'll flnd a way to silence
the mother.

1349
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:38,452
See what a swamp you've
driven me into?

1350
01:43:39,290 --> 01:43:41,292
When you're sitting in prison...

1351
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:44,300
...then you'll know what a swamp is.

1352
01:43:46,370 --> 01:43:48,452
- Go! Away!
- Stop!

1353
01:43:49,330 --> 01:43:51,458
- Don't go!
- Move it, I said!

1354
01:43:52,290 --> 01:43:55,260
No, stop! This ls all rubbish!
Where is my mirror?

1355
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:57,492
- You won't be needing a mirror any more!
- My clock]

1356
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:00,293
You've run out of time!

1357
01:44:00,370 --> 01:44:02,338
Rubbish! This is all rubbish!

1358
01:44:02,490 --> 01:44:05,494
- Rubbish? These are your treasures! Go!
- Leave him alone!

1359
01:44:06,450 --> 01:44:08,339
Devil!

1360
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:10,416
- Crook!
- Move it!

1361
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,259
It's a n outrage!

1362
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:15,418
Enough, I said!

1363
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:17,379
I want only one nlght.
That's all I wan!!

1364
01:44:17,490 --> 01:44:19,379
One night.

1365
01:44:19,450 --> 01:44:21,452
- Only one nlght. Alone with her.
- All alone?

1366
01:44:21,490 --> 01:44:23,413
One whole night.

1367
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:25,333
The things you want!

1368
01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:29,372
She shares a room with her mother!

1369
01:44:33,450 --> 01:44:35,293
One night.

1370
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:39,459
Please. Just one night.

1371
01:44:46,290 --> 01:44:47,371
Why such complications?

1372
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:51,372
You could just invite the Ilttle
doll to your place.

1373
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:53,451
She already knows the way.

1374
01:44:54,410 --> 01:44:56,299
After what I've confessed?

1375
01:44:58,450 --> 01:45:00,339
What happened In your intellect?

1376
01:45:01,490 --> 01:45:04,460
Where is your imagination?

1377
01:45:05,370 --> 01:45:06,496
I have no imagination.

1378
01:45:07,450 --> 01:45:09,373
I have something better.

1379
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:14,340
You sign here. and Margarete is yours.

1380
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:19,451
What is this?

1381
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:37,380
- Thls ls full of mistakes!
- Oh really?

1382
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:40,492
"With this signature"...

1383
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:47,415
With (his, my personal signature...

1384
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:51,334
"I bequeath"... There's something
wrong here.

1385
01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:54,454
I. Heinrich Faust, bequeath...

1386
01:45:57,410 --> 01:46:00,414
"to the bearer of the letter"...

1387
01:46:02,450 --> 01:46:04,293
..."this" letter...

1388
01:46:07,290 --> 01:46:09,372
..."my sol“...
Soul is spelled with a "u"I

1389
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:12,294
- With a "u"! How nice.
- ..."after its natural"...

1390
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:15,414
..."separation from my body." Yes.

1391
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:19,259
Now it's correct.

1392
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:21,371
I've run out of ink!

1393
01:46:23,370 --> 01:46:24,451
What a shame!

1394
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:27,293
Perhaps you could use blood?

1395
01:46:27,450 --> 01:46:31,296
You were prepared
to write in blond.

1396
01:46:57,330 --> 01:46:59,458
Behave yourself!
You're a guest here!

1397
01:47:01,410 --> 01:47:03,333
Lousy dog!

1398
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:07,300
What a hideous language, your German.

1399
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:11,458
All the same.

1400
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:14,458
- So what now?
- Now? You'll get your Margarete.

1401
01:47:15,290 --> 01:47:17,292
I'll see In my side of the bargain.

1402
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:21,491
I know where she is.

1403
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:24,412
- Let's go then.
- So impatient!

1404
01:47:24,490 --> 01:47:26,333
Fulfil your obligation!

1405
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:28,333
Thank you. Where are we going?

1406
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:31,260
I'll take you to your dearest
by the quickest way.

1407
01:47:32,330 --> 01:47:34,332
There is a secret path!

1408
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,456
And where is it?

1409
01:47:38,370 --> 01:47:39,496
I'll show you.

1410
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:41,371
There is no chimney on my lamp!

1411
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:46,418
This path is underground!

1412
01:47:47,410 --> 01:47:49,378
Underground!

1413
01:47:49,450 --> 01:47:52,420
- Here It ls! Which way?
- This way I

1414
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:55,416
My secret tunnel!

1415
01:47:56,370 --> 01:47:58,372
I'll lead the way.
This is my way.

1416
01:47:58,490 --> 01:48:00,458
I've never shown it tn anyone.

1417
01:48:04,330 --> 01:48:06,378
What a devilish tunnel!

1418
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:08,411
But somehow it's easy to breathe here.

1419
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:16,496
A deep well.

1420
01:48:17,330 --> 01:48:19,378
My storeroom for cowardly souls.

1421
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:22,332
I'll lead the way. Let me through.

1422
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:32,416
Do you still want tu do it?

1423
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:44,301
Thls ls all sedimentary cover rock.
as far as I can tell.

1424
01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:46,418
You'd better thlnk about
good cover for yourself.

1425
01:48:47,410 --> 01:48:49,378
The little one will do you no harm.

1426
01:48:51,370 --> 01:48:54,260
But the old hag...
I know how tn pacify her.

1427
01:48:54,330 --> 01:48:56,298
- Do you want to decapitate her?
- Dear Doctor!

1428
01:48:56,410 --> 01:48:59,493
- Rip out her tongue?
- A good herbal tea...

1429
01:49:00,490 --> 01:49:02,413
...and she'll fall asleep forever.

1430
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:06,254
Fall asleep forever?

1431
01:49:06,370 --> 01:49:07,451
Yes, nice and quiet.

1432
01:49:08,490 --> 01:49:11,380
We'll leave them here.
For the way back.

1433
01:49:15,410 --> 01:49:17,333
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

1434
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:22,458
The poor girl. The dear child.

1435
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:25,379
There she is.

1436
01:49:25,450 --> 01:49:27,452
I just knew ii.

1437
01:49:28,330 --> 01:49:31,300
Thls ls where all young souls
go when they're suffering.

1438
01:49:38,450 --> 01:49:40,259
Go!

1439
01:49:42,290 --> 01:49:43,496
Go!

1440
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:46,338
You wanted to save her.

1441
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:49,379
You can save her now.

1442
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:04,500
My peace ls gone,
my hear! is sore...

1443
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:06,259
Is there anyone here?

1444
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:09,338
How cold it is here.

1445
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:13,378
Cold.

1446
01:51:27,370 --> 01:51:29,372
Why are all these things
scattered here?

1447
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:33,378
I don't understand.

1448
01:51:34,290 --> 01:51:35,416
Who did this?

1449
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:38,491
This is his herbal tea.

1450
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:41,496
L!'s your flask. Doctor.

1451
01:51:47,370 --> 01:51:48,496
I have Io go.

1452
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:51,416
I have Io go.

1453
01:51:53,290 --> 01:51:56,419
Now you may enter. No pushing!
Behave in an orderly manner!

1454
01:51:57,450 --> 01:51:59,339
Come on.

1455
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:05,293
I'll help you.

1456
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:07,333
There's someone here.

1457
01:53:09,330 --> 01:53:10,456
The clock has stopped.

1458
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:13,299
The hands have fallen down.

1459
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:17,253
L!'s draughty in here.

1460
01:53:19,410 --> 01:53:21,299
You're cold.

1461
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:28,293
I have Io go.

1462
01:53:32,490 --> 01:53:34,413
Those cats again.

1463
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:38,373
I hate cats.

1464
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:53,411
I don'¢ wa nt tn...

1465
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:56,293
I don'¢ wa nt tn...

1466
01:53:57,490 --> 01:53:59,492
Where are my things? What is this?

1467
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:02,333
A straitjacket.

1468
01:54:09,490 --> 01:54:12,300
God help me... Gnd save me.

1469
01:54:19,370 --> 01:54:21,293
I don'¢ wa nt tn...

1470
01:54:22,410 --> 01:54:24,412
- Well, finally!
- I don't want to.

1471
01:54:27,490 --> 01:54:29,333
- What ls this?!
- Your armour.

1472
01:54:29,410 --> 01:54:31,378
What are you doing"

1473
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:35,292
- Where did you get such strength?
- I want to save you.

1474
01:54:37,410 --> 01:54:39,253
It's the best armour I have!

1475
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:43,338
A good man needs good armour!

1476
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:47,381
I'm not good! Don't touch me!
I cannot stand violence!

1477
01:54:49,330 --> 01:54:52,334
Come to me!
One step and then you're free!

1478
01:54:53,490 --> 01:54:56,300
- Where to?
- Forward, march!

1479
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:02,292
Your loitering draws Death closer!

1480
01:55:18,490 --> 01:55:21,300
Not every murderer
is forgiven his guilt.

1481
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:23,293
I! has to be earned.

1482
01:55:23,410 --> 01:55:25,333
What sense ls there In fleeing?
I must stay.

1483
01:55:25,410 --> 01:55:28,414
You must live.
We're people destined for great things.

1484
01:55:33,450 --> 01:55:35,293
I wish that I had never been born.

1485
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:38,374
It would be best not to be born
at all, my friend!

1486
01:55:39,410 --> 01:55:42,414
Much better than finally to dle,
fortunate as that might seem.

1487
01:55:42,490 --> 01:55:44,492
- What do you mean?
- Finally you're awake!

1488
01:55:45,370 --> 01:55:46,451
Then go saddle up!

1489
01:55:47,290 --> 01:55:49,372
I'm a poor horseman.

1490
01:55:51,410 --> 01:55:53,378
But a good man.

1491
01:55:54,450 --> 01:55:56,339
Where are you going?

1492
01:55:56,410 --> 01:55:58,333
Where, where? There.

1493
01:55:58,450 --> 01:56:00,418
You'll like it there. I know it.

1494
01:56:00,490 --> 01:56:03,380
- I'm dizzy.
- It's ever the same...

1495
01:56:03,490 --> 01:56:05,649
...man wants to fly, yet he ca n't
cope with dizziness.

1496
01:56:05,650 --> 01:56:06,492
...Man wa nts to fly, yet he ca n't
cope with dizziness.

1497
01:56:07,330 --> 01:56:09,298
You're a man. A soldier.

1498
01:56:09,410 --> 01:56:11,333
What? What am I?

1499
01:56:11,410 --> 01:56:13,378
In the end. you are what you are.

1500
01:56:14,330 --> 01:56:17,459
I don't recognise anything here.
The forester's house was here.

1501
01:56:18,290 --> 01:56:20,338
And over Ihere, the mill.

1502
01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:22,418
The mill? I!'s gone.

1503
01:56:22,450 --> 01:56:24,373
What do you mean, gone?

1504
01:56:24,450 --> 01:56:28,250
- Very simple.
- But the mill can't just...

1505
01:56:29,330 --> 01:56:31,332
I don't understand.

1506
01:56:35,450 --> 01:56:38,420
Armour becomes you.
Very noble, powerful.

1507
01:56:39,250 --> 01:56:41,457
It befits your name: Heinrich.
Which means...

1508
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:44,492
..."mighty wall."
Or just Heinrich the Mighty.

1509
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:48,300
What about your name, Mauricius?
What does it mean?

1510
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:50,492
- The dark one.
- It's a rare name.

1511
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:54,419
Yes, it's a martyr's name.
And a publisher's.

1512
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:56,456
Come! Send the horses home!

1513
01:56:57,370 --> 01:56:59,338
They'll find their way!

1514
01:57:00,290 --> 01:57:01,416
It is getting tight here!

1515
01:57:02,290 --> 01:57:03,371
Why do we have do go through there?

1516
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:05,339
This is the stairway ta heaven.

1517
01:57:06,290 --> 01:57:09,339
But It might lead us
in an entirely different direction.

1518
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:13,294
Why have you stopped?
What are you mourning?

1519
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:15,379
I'll show you something better.

1520
01:57:18,370 --> 01:57:21,453
Here I stand: I cannot do otherwise.

1521
01:57:22,330 --> 01:57:24,298
So help me God!

1522
01:57:28,330 --> 01:57:30,298
Be careful with my beautiful armour!

1523
01:57:30,490 --> 01:57:33,334
Don't scratch it!
It's borrowed.

1524
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:35,458
- From whom?
- How inquisitive you are!

1525
01:57:36,290 --> 01:57:37,451
Must be our theatre director.

1526
01:57:38,290 --> 01:57:40,418
And now I'm supposed to amuse
the world like a fool?

1527
01:57:40,490 --> 01:57:44,415
You can amuse only me.
There is no one else here.

1528
01:57:45,410 --> 01:57:47,458
- Where are we?
- Far away and high up!

1529
01:57:48,290 --> 01:57:50,292
Very, very high up!

1530
01:57:51,330 --> 01:57:52,456
It's so easy to breathe here!

1531
01:57:53,290 --> 01:57:54,496
I should think so.

1532
01:58:05,290 --> 01:58:06,496
- What Is this here?
- Nothing.

1533
01:58:07,490 --> 01:58:12,291
- We're not alone here.
- Who could be haunting this place?

1534
01:58:12,490 --> 01:58:14,458
Maybe the Greeks?
I have some here.

1535
01:58:15,370 --> 01:58:17,293
Move!

1536
01:58:28,450 --> 01:58:30,498
- I have to get through, ton!
- Thank you! I can see...

1537
01:58:31,330 --> 01:58:33,298
...you're slowly recovering.

1538
01:58:35,450 --> 01:58:38,374
I've had enough of this masquerade.

1539
01:58:39,370 --> 01:58:41,338
It's a pity, but alright.

1540
01:58:44,490 --> 01:58:47,300
In for a penny, in for a pound.

1541
01:58:47,330 --> 01:58:49,458
- The greaves, please.
- I'm no! your servant.

1542
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:53,334
- Not a servant. Atypical human being!
- I'm going ahead.

1543
01:58:58,330 --> 01:58:59,491
- Where to?
- To the left.

1544
01:59:03,450 --> 01:59:05,373
Damned bootsl

1545
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:13,371
Tell me now, where are we?

1546
01:59:13,450 --> 01:59:15,418
I told you:
far away and very high up.

1547
01:59:15,490 --> 01:59:17,413
- And what ls this here?
- Nothing.

1548
01:59:18,290 --> 01:59:19,416
Go look for yourself.

1549
01:59:26,290 --> 01:59:28,338
I know...

1550
01:59:28,410 --> 01:59:31,300
...you hope to discover
the all in my nothingness.

1551
01:59:31,370 --> 01:59:32,496
Let the living go on hoping.

1552
01:59:35,490 --> 01:59:39,336
We were forgotten here.

1553
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:47,295
- We are forsaken.
- What are you doing here?

1554
01:59:47,410 --> 01:59:49,253
It's your old acquaintance!

1555
02:00:13,410 --> 02:00:15,378
- Thank you.
- Let me go!

1556
02:00:19,290 --> 02:00:21,372
What do you want frnm me?

1557
02:00:22,290 --> 02:00:24,418
Let go of my ha nd!

1558
02:00:28,490 --> 02:00:30,458
Help!

1559
02:00:31,290 --> 02:00:33,372
- Stay here with us.
- I wa nt to leave!

1560
02:00:37,450 --> 02:00:39,339
I! is freezing here.

1561
02:00:41,250 --> 02:00:42,490
Take charge of us.

1562
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:46,374
- Vou're so warm.
- Lead us into battle.

1563
02:00:47,330 --> 02:00:48,491
The war is over.

1564
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:56,333
I have In save you once again.

1565
02:00:59,330 --> 02:01:01,412
I don't understand
what they see in you!

1566
02:01:05,410 --> 02:01:07,333
Without armour
you're not a general!

1567
02:01:10,370 --> 02:01:12,452
- Thls way?
- Yes. this way.

1568
02:01:18,450 --> 02:01:20,373
Let me go first!

1569
02:01:26,290 --> 02:01:27,416
What did he thank me for?

1570
02:01:27,490 --> 02:01:29,413
Death, of course.

1571
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:33,338
Because Ilfe was even harder
for him than death.

1572
02:01:35,330 --> 02:01:36,411
I don't understand.

1573
02:01:37,410 --> 02:01:39,333
What's there to understand?

1574
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:40,491
Eternal poverty.

1575
02:01:41,330 --> 02:01:42,491
Dependency on his mother.

1576
02:01:43,330 --> 02:01:45,298
And on his sister's whims.

1577
02:01:46,290 --> 02:01:48,258
He was a proud man...

1578
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:50,376
...and all that wounded him.

1579
02:01:51,450 --> 02:01:53,293
What A pity...

1580
02:01:53,410 --> 02:01:55,492
...that you didn't kill him in battle.

1581
02:01:56,370 --> 02:01:57,496
Tha! would have been nobler.

1582
02:01:58,370 --> 02:01:59,451
Never mind.

1583
02:02:00,290 --> 02:02:02,338
One must know how
to laugh off such things.

1584
02:02:07,450 --> 02:02:10,374
What will become of the girl?

1585
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:14,498
She might he imprisoned.

1586
02:02:20,290 --> 02:02:21,416
But are we going to save Ma rga rete?

1587
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:25,250
If the old hag wakes up.
we won'! have In save her.

1588
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:28,294
- Are we going to save Margarete?
- of course not.

1589
02:02:29,490 --> 02:02:31,379
In any case...

1590
02:02:32,250 --> 02:02:34,491
..we'd flrst have to ask her whether
she wa nts to be saved by us.

1591
02:02:36,410 --> 02:02:38,333
L!'s different with you.

1592
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:41,299
We are partners.

1593
02:02:42,370 --> 02:02:43,451
We have a contract.

1594
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:49,339
So that's how it is.

1595
02:02:51,370 --> 02:02:53,259
Where is tha! smoke coming from?

1596
02:02:55,290 --> 02:02:56,371
Wait!

1597
02:02:57,490 --> 02:03:00,460
I did everything I promised to do.

1598
02:03:02,410 --> 02:03:05,414
- But you...
- It's not enough for me.

1599
02:03:06,290 --> 02:03:08,418
- I'm worth more.
- What else do you want?

1600
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:11,378
Another sun? Another homunculus?
Two, perhaps!

1601
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:13,373
L!'s not enough for mel

1602
02:03:16,410 --> 02:03:19,334
- What a spectacle!
- It's a fantasy.

1603
02:03:19,410 --> 02:03:21,412
No! You're lying!
This isn't a fantasy!

1604
02:03:26,490 --> 02:03:29,380
- How does It work?
- My fountain isn't so harmless.

1605
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:31,496
It's hot!

1606
02:03:32,330 --> 02:03:34,458
- Are you happy now?
- How does it work?

1607
02:03:35,330 --> 02:03:37,412
I don't need to know.
The Lord Gnd knows.

1608
02:03:38,290 --> 02:03:40,338
Come on now. It's dangerous here.

1609
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:42,333
God doesn't know.

1610
02:03:42,490 --> 02:03:45,255
Bu! I do.

1611
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:48,456
The heat rises upwards...

1612
02:03:50,290 --> 02:03:52,418
...the cold sinks towards the interior..

1613
02:03:53,330 --> 02:03:54,491
...Of the earth.
- Yes. very interesting.

1614
02:03:55,370 --> 02:03:57,293
I could recreate this in a snap.

1615
02:03:57,450 --> 02:03:59,373
Come on! We're leaving!

1616
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:01,451
No! I'm staying!

1617
02:04:02,330 --> 02:04:04,332
He wants to recreate my fountain.
You want to achieve glory?

1618
02:04:04,450 --> 02:04:06,293
The deed is everything. not the glory.

1619
02:04:06,410 --> 02:04:08,412
Let me see your deed at last!

1620
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:15,492
Friends don't treat each other this way!

1621
02:04:17,410 --> 02:04:19,458
- It really hurts!
- Crying is good fur one.

1622
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:25,294
Even someone Ilke you
must suffer at some point.

1623
02:04:25,410 --> 02:04:27,378
What do you know about suffering?

1624
02:04:29,410 --> 02:04:32,254
What can be so special
about your suffering?

1625
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:36,298
Soon you'll know for yourself.

1626
02:04:36,450 --> 02:04:39,294
Eternal solitude,
and no hope of salvation.

1627
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:45,292
Quiet! Enough!

1628
02:04:46,330 --> 02:04:47,456
I already know everything
about you.

1629
02:04:48,330 --> 02:04:49,411
You're only disturbing me.

1630
02:04:50,450 --> 02:04:52,339
Quiet now!

1631
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:55,333
Pointless hole!

1632
02:04:56,410 --> 02:04:58,333
I decide everything here!

1633
02:05:00,290 --> 02:05:02,452
It is not yours to decide anything here.

1634
02:05:15,450 --> 02:05:18,420
Walt! You can stay longer
if you wish.

1635
02:05:18,490 --> 02:05:20,333
Even without a soul.

1636
02:05:20,450 --> 02:05:23,420
Leave me alone.
I don'¢ need you anymore!

1637
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:25,411
What is it you want?

1638
02:05:27,490 --> 02:05:29,458
Why did you show me those madmen...

1639
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:33,497
...who even In the sleep of death cannot
forget their war?

1640
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:38,259
What have you given me?

1641
02:05:38,370 --> 02:05:41,419
Not even money for my ring!

1642
02:05:42,370 --> 02:05:44,338
Power, influence...

1643
02:05:44,410 --> 02:05:46,412
...one can only seize
such goods oneself!

1644
02:05:50,410 --> 02:05:51,491
Nature and spirit...

1645
02:05:52,370 --> 02:05:54,372
...that is all one needs...

1646
02:05:54,490 --> 02:05:58,336
...to create here, on this free land,
a free people.

1647
02:06:00,290 --> 02:06:01,496
But. seriously now, I have a contract.

1648
02:06:02,330 --> 02:06:03,411
A contract?

1649
02:06:05,490 --> 02:06:07,413
You signed it!

1650
02:06:07,490 --> 02:06:09,413
I have to concentrate!
Leave me alone.

1651
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:12,378
Wait! The soul! Your soul.

1652
02:06:12,490 --> 02:06:15,300
- I'm entitled to It.
- The soul?

1653
02:06:16,490 --> 02:06:19,460
You signed the contract
with your blood!

1654
02:06:20,290 --> 02:06:21,451
Feel free to submit It on
Judgement Day.

1655
02:06:22,370 --> 02:06:24,498
No! What are you doing?

1656
02:06:29,330 --> 02:06:31,332
That's that then.

1657
02:06:33,370 --> 02:06:34,496

1658
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:43,491
And that is for the mother?

1659
02:06:47,330 --> 02:06:49,332
Stay thee a while! This isn't pretty!

1660
02:06:50,450 --> 02:06:52,339
Again, again, again, again.

1661
02:06:52,490 --> 02:06:55,460
Bad shot!

1662
02:07:01,370 --> 02:07:03,338
Bad shot!

1663
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:31,414
Who will feed you?

1664
02:07:33,330 --> 02:07:35,492
Who will guide you out of here?

1665
02:07:39,490 --> 02:07:43,336
Over now.
Over as if it never was.

1666
02:07:45,410 --> 02:07:48,380
Over: what a stupid word!

1667
02:07:52,330 --> 02:07:53,456
Where are you going?

1668
02:07:57,250 --> 02:07:58,411

1669
02:07:59,490 --> 02:08:01,458
