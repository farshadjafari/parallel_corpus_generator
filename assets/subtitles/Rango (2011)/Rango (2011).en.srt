<i>Rango! Rango!</i>

00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:28,774
<i>Rango!</i>

4
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,400
We are gathered here today
to immortalize in song

5
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,316
the life and untimely death
of a great legend.

6
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:43,806
So sit back, relax, and enjoy your low
calorie popcorn and assorted confections,

7
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:48,719
while we tell you the strange and
bewildering tale of a hero

8
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,320
who has yet to enter his own story

9
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:05,618
Hmmm. Hmmmaoh. Muh. Mmmuh!
Mmmmuh! Hmmmuh!

00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:09,162
Crunchy-creamy-coky-candle
-cupcake.

11
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:12,428
Okay, everybody!
Let's take it from the top.

12
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,666
The stage is set. The night
moist with apprehension.

13
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:21,042
Alone in her chamber, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

14
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:24,920
<i>It is far better to nourish
worms than to live without love!</i>

15
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,916
<i>She reaches for
the poison chalice.</i>

16
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,427
<i>Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio
plots his ascension to the throne.</i>

17
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:32,767
<i>While her aging father
lies gravely ill.</i>

18
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:35,497
Yes, I'm gravely ill...

19
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,490
<i>Hark, who goes there?</i>

20
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,966
It is I!
The much anticipated hero

21
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,807
returning to rescue
his emotionally unstable maiden.

22
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:49,368
Unhand her you jailers of virtue or
taste the bitter sting of my vengeance!

23
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,593
The sting of my...the....

24
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:57,665
Doctor Marks? Doctor Marks,
I'm not getting anything from you!

25
00:02:57,665 --> 00:03:01,657
People, we've talked about this!
Acting is reacting.

26
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:04,038
Victor, you were wooden!
There, I said it.

27
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:05,999
Mister Tims, you were good.

28
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,105
Perhaps a little too good!

29
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:13,251
What's that, Victor? My character's
undefined? That's absurd!

30
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:17,857
I know who I am. I'm thee...
I'm the guy! The protagonist, the hero!

31
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:20,161
Every story needs a hero!

32
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:25,722
I mean, who else is better qualified to bask
in the adulation of his numerous companions!

33
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:48,897
<i>The stage is waiting.
The audience thirsts for adventure. </i>

34
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:52,356
<i>Who am I? </i>

35
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:55,217
<i>I could be anyone!</i>

36
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:58,933
I...I could be the sea captain
returning from a mighty voyage,

37
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,694
to reclaim his mechanical arm!

38
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:07,187
Or the rogue anthropologist,
battling pythons down in the Congo!

39
00:04:07,187 --> 00:04:09,028
Down, Chunga!

40
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:16,280
And if you desire romance, I will become
the greatest lover the world has ever known!

41
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:19,827
Hola!

42
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:26,726
I couldn't help but notice
you noticing me noticing you.

43
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:30,335
You know the womens find me
uncomfortably good looking.

44
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,060
But you seem remarkably at ease.

45
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,133
Oh, stop it!
No, really...

46
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,552
Well, if you must!
Ha ha! What are you doing?

47
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:39,633
Oh! That tickles!
Are those real?

48
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:45,238
That's it! Conflict! Victor, you
were right! I have been undefined!

49
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:50,258
People, I've had an epiphany!
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

50
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:53,757
What our story needs is
an ironic, unexpected event,

51
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:56,725
that will propel the hero into conflict.

52
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:51,237
Mister Tims?

53
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,839
<i>...oye...</i>

54
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,885
<i>That's right! You!</i>

55
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:38,015
<i>Don't be shy. Come on.
Is okay.</i>

56
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:40,176
<i>That's it,
a little closer...</i>

57
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:42,834
<i>Ah. Good.</i>

58
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,760
<i>I won't bite you.</i>

59
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,924
I need a little help here.

60
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:51,052
Uh...are you okay?

61
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:53,745
I must get to the other side.

62
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:56,518
The other side? You mean just now
that was you crossing the road?

63
00:06:56,518 --> 00:07:03,159
That's why... Why did you do that?!
- This is my quest. He waits for me.

64
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,657
Whe... What...Who?

65
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,152
The Spirit of the West, amigo.
The One.

66
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:12,411
They say he rides an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

67
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:14,292
Wha...
What are you talking about?

68
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:17,613
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.

69
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:21,010
Nothing?! Your delusional quest
just ruined my life!

70
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,269
I had an incredibly complex social network!
Highly sophisticated friends! I was very popular!

71
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:33,000
Friends? I don't see no friends. - Well,
uhm... - You are a very lonely lizard.

72
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:37,978
Now...Help me up, and I'll
help you find what you seek.

73
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:40,895
Uhh...You will? - Quickly now.
I must get back to my quest.

74
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:44,456
You mean, you've done this before?
- O, yes. Many times.

75
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:47,959
Come, come. - Argh... - That'sit.
Pull my finger.

76
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,440
Uhh... - The Spirit is
waiting for me!

77
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,541
Okay, okay...

78
00:07:57,902 --> 00:08:01,126
Okay! That's not gonna work.
- I must get to the other side.

79
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:04,543
Why don't you just wait
until there are no cars coming?

80
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:06,344
Is not so easy as it looks...

81
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:07,347
A what?

82
00:08:07,347 --> 00:08:08,948
Is a metaphore.

83
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:39,146
Hey, there's another one!

84
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,029
I knew it!

85
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:54,870
You need a little help,
amigo?

86
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,206
I think the metaphore broke my spleen.

87
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,756
- The path to knowledge
is fraught with consequence.

88
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:03,085
Yeah... I'm just lookog for
the path to water.

89
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:08,406
If you want to find water,
you must first find dirt.

90
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,054
Dirt?

91
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,912
Destiny, she is kind to you.

92
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:16,193
Tomorrow is Wednesday,
the water comes.

93
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:20,517
At noon the towns people gather
for a mysterious ritual...

94
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:24,237
Wow! What uhhh...a town? Like
with real people and everything?

95
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:28,638
Where? - A days journey.
Follow your shadow.

96
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:34,171
You want me to just  walk out
into the desert?

97
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:35,255
Uhumm... Tha's the way.

98
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:39,976
Okay. So you're saying there's a town,
a real town? Not a metaphor town?

99
00:09:39,976 --> 00:09:41,617
Go on.
It's okay.

100
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:45,252
Okay. Well, then I'm going.

101
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,664
I am leaving the road
- now!

102
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,337
I'm walking ... into...
the desert!

103
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:56,258
Alone!
- We all have our journeys to make!

104
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:59,396
I will see you on the other side...

105
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:19,067
<i>Welcome, amigo,
to the land without end,</i>

106
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:25,677
<i>The desert and death are
the closest of friends...</i>

107
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,490
<i>we sing of his courage
in this gleeful sung song,</i>

108
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:37,961
<i>Better pay close attetnion,
he won't be here long...</i>

109
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,515
Here in the Mojave desert, animals
have had millions of years to adapt

110
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:03,625
to the harsh environment.

111
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:07,003
But the lizard, he is going to die.

112
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:11,673
Four score and seven years ago...
Our fathers... - Don't move!

113
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:12,774
What?

114
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,940
Don't move!
- I'm not moving!

115
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,857
I'm not moving.
- Try to blend in.

116
00:11:22,857 --> 00:11:24,738
What? Blend in?
Wha...whaaa...what do you mean?

117
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:29,575
Blend in!

118
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:31,096
Huh? Wh..wha...wha...
what are you saying?

119
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:36,803
Too late. - No! No! It's not too late!
I..I'm blending! I'm a blender!

120
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:40,145
Calm down!
What are you doing?

121
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:43,309
Don't move!

122
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:45,311
Try not to look conspicuous.

123
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,334
Hey, pst!
Whad'ya doing?

124
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:56,908
I'm blending.
- Go and blend somewhere else.

125
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:58,367
Don't distract me!
- No room at the inn!

126
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,747
It's an art not a science!!
- Find your own hiding place!

127
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:04,586
This is good. - Oh, here she comes!
You better run, Mojito!

128
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:08,107
What? But you said "don't move".
- That was before. Now... you run!

129
00:12:10,383 --> 00:12:11,943
Adios, amigo.

130
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,220
Oh, hey!
Where's your basket?

131
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:57,051
Oh, thirsty?

132
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,380
Please! Please don't! Please don't!
I have vertigo! My glands are swollen!

133
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,678
Please, no...

134
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:23,442
Hey...Madre de Dios!

135
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:27,774
You! I kill you, you stupid lizard
Get out of there!

136
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,935
I can't help but taste the days
of action! - Oh just shut up and shoot!

137
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:34,184
No, wait! Come back!
I was just kidding!

138
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:36,865
We friends, hey?
- I...I don't know you.

139
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:39,060
Lizards, frogs...- Move over!
- We' practically related!

140
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,221
Move over! - I let you
kiss my sister!

141
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:54,087
You son of a ....

142
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,898
<i>Where are your friends
now, amigo?</i>

143
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,690
Heeeeeeeelp!

144
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:19,622
Get your slimy,
webbed phalanges off my boots!

145
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,244
Oh! Uh...sorry!! - I got a beat on you,
stranger. You get up real slow.

146
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:27,661
Or you wanna spend your afternoon
pickin' your face back together!

147
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:28,966
No, no, no, no, ma'm,
I don't...

148
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:30,962
Who are you?
- Whhhoo...am I?

149
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:36,759
I'm askin' the questions here!
We're in the middle of a drought

150
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:41,788
now someone's
dumping water in the desert.

151
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:42,789
Now I suppose it's indeterminable s
omethin' to mention

152
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:44,469
but I intend to find out
what role you play in all this.

153
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:45,470
Role? - What are you involved in?

154
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,964
Oh! Well, I...I'm glad you asked. I've got
two one acts, a mystery and a musical

155
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:51,030
I've been gestating.

156
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,333
I've got the words. I'm just kinda
workin' on the melody. It's like a...

157
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:56,375
It's...I think it's gonna be
a western.

158
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,096
<i>Hey, monkey got a cracker... Hmhmhm
His mother's making supper.. La-la-la-la...</i>

159
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:06,515
You ain't from round here,
are you?

160
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:09,592
I..I'm...I'm still workin' on it.

161
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,882
Uh...so, what's your name?

162
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:14,917
Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.

163
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:20,201
What can I say, my daddy
plum loved baked beans.

164
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:20,235
Well, you're lucky
he didn't plum love asparagus.

165
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:23,348
What...what are you sayin'? - I mean,
I...I enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

166
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:27,136
but I'm not sure that the child uh...
would appreciate the moniker.

167
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:30,234
My daddy was a fine man. Even if he
did exibit proclivity for lagoons ...- Hm, spicey.

168
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,990
You're eating his ashes!
- Uh. You carry his remains?

169
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,991
No! His ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.

170
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:40,023
Oh! Well, I'm sure he had his reasons.

171
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:41,942
What are you implyin'?
- Nothing. I...

172
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:42,943
Oh! Well,
I'm sure he had his reasons.

173
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:45,436
My daddy was never near that mine shaft.
He'd  been sober for over a month.

174
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:52,077
And for you to insinuate that he would
abandon his parental responsibilities

175
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,078
at a delicate time in my personal
development is an up front to my

176
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,240
Miss Beans?

177
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,817
Miss Beans?
Hello?

178
00:17:01,322 --> 00:17:03,462
Hee-lo?

179
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:21,828
...and I'm telling to people that "Adndromeda 5"
will return safe and sound

180
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:24,189
and I will not sell my ranch!

181
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:27,241
What? - What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

182
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:29,160
What am I doing?
- You... were cuddling me.

183
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,080
We... well went frozen.
- No I didn't ...

184
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,381
Yes. You stopped talking.
- That's defence mechanism.

185
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:37,022
Actually lots of people have it.
- Now you've made that up!

186
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,513
So, you're gonna die out here
or you wanna a ride into town?

187
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:44,257
No! No!. No! Uh... Yeah! No!
Yeas please! Thank you.

188
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:50,007
Today's Wednesday. - Wednesday?
- When we all get to it. So who are you really?

189
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:53,407
Well, I'm a man of many epithets.

190
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:56,973
There's my stage name, my pen name,
my avatar. Had a pseudonym once, but had to ...

191
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,794
And so the stranger
seeking companionship

192
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:05,462
finds a woman. Much like
the sirens of the ancient times

193
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:10,082
luring him to his certain demise.

194
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:13,499
...and I'm actually of the few men
with the maiden name!

195
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:15,260
Whow! Here we are.

196
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:28,442
Oh, oh, right. Well, I sure do appreciate it,
Miss Beans, and if there's anything I could...

197
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,680
See ya,
Beans.

198
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,346
WELCOME TO "DIRT"
- w_anna 2001 -

199
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:52,125
Your're leaving us, Jim?
- Well, we gave it up on that shop.

200
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:56,446
Gotta sell it. Can't roll
no crowd for I got no water.

201
00:18:56,446 --> 00:18:57,446
Bye!

202
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:05,357
What is it?

203
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,171
What was that for?
- You're funny looking.

204
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:15,125
Well, you're funny looking too!
- That's a funny looking shirt!

205
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,044
That's a funny looking dress!
- You got funny looking eyes!

206
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:18,525
You gotta funny looking face!

207
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:23,624
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.

208
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:27,719
Here's your beans, Beans. - I'm
gonna need some more feed, too, Willie.

209
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:31,712
Well you almost got three corts already.
I can't give you no more credits.

210
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,939
But I have what I owe you
at noon.

211
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:39,940
You don't understand. It's Mr. Merrymack
from the bank, he cut off all credits.

212
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,041
Hey, Beans?

213
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,463
You know that there fella?
- Beans? Miss Beans?

214
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:46,785
Nope. - Hey, Beans...

215
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:48,537
Hey...

216
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:54,223
Oh. Right! Blend in!

217
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:23,897
I'd like a... glass of water?

218
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:27,522
He wants a glass of water!

219
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:31,179
Make it a double!
- Give him two!

220
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:37,871
Cactus juice.
That's all we got.

221
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:06,451
Hey, Fruitcup? You are
a long way from home, ain't ya?

222
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,848
Who exactly are you?

223
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,935
<i>Who am I?</i>

224
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,015
<i>I could be anyone.</i>

225
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:20,213
HECHO IN: DURANGO

226
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,962
What's the matter? Your miss
your mamma's mangos?

227
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,080
As a matter of fact, I am.

228
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:31,996
But not as much as your
daddy's cooking!

229
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:36,054
Exactly... where did you say
you were from?

230
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:39,433
Me? I'm from the West.

231
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:43,387
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Pass the sunset.

232
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:45,268
The Far west...

233
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,648
Yea, that's right hombres.

234
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:53,609
The place I come from, we kill a man
before breakfast, just to work up an appetite.

235
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,978
We salt him and we pepper him,
we braise him clarified butter

236
00:22:57,978 --> 00:23:00,397
and then we eat him.

237
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:02,398
You eat him?
- That's what I said!

238
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:06,541
Hell, I've seen things make a grown man
lose control of his glandular function.

239
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:09,574
You spend three days in a horse
carcass, livin' off you own juices.

240
00:23:09,574 --> 00:23:12,535
It'll change a man!
Oh, yes.

241
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:19,288
Have a few extra aces in this deck, yea?
Just the way I like it.

242
00:23:20,113 --> 00:23:24,055
So no, my hair shootin' rodent little friend,
I am not from around these parts.

243
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:26,027
You might say I'm from everywhere

244
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,869
there's trouble brewin'
and hell waiting to be raised.

245
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:32,037
You might say I'm
what hell's already raised up!

246
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:36,944
Name's...
Rango.

247
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:43,017
Are you that fella that
killed them Jenkins brothers?

248
00:23:43,017 --> 00:23:46,298
Aha, killed them with one bullet.

249
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:48,316
Don't get no deader.

250
00:23:48,316 --> 00:23:50,517
All seven of 'em?

251
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,877
That's right.

252
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:54,755
All sven of them.

253
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:59,771
Exactly how did you do that,
Mr. Rango?

254
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:05,364
Y'know I'm glad you asked me that.
And... I would be happy to tell you!

255
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:07,965
But you all gotta have to
listen up,

256
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:12,889
because this is where it gets...
complicated.

257
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:17,459
I'm about to close the account, Mrs. Goats -
two go to the swig.

258
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:21,140
Hands off, Mordekao, that's what
swept off your college education!

259
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:25,292
I don't have any other choice, Beans.

260
00:24:25,292 --> 00:24:29,373
Times being so hard, we...
we just can't give no more credit.

261
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,622
But this here is a bank!
This is where you keep the water.

262
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,244
Keep the wate..

263
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:39,282
Beans, you've been like a niece to me.
Ever since your daddy...

264
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:45,051
did NOT fall drunk down a mine shaft.
And uh...I've...

265
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:49,703
I've tried to protect you and others
from certain realities.

266
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:52,400
Oh...the weight of them realities...
- G. Merrymack?

267
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:54,444
G. Merrymack?

268
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:57,084
Are you all right?

269
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,238
Beans, I need to
sh...show you something.

270
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,403
That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!

271
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:16,641
I don't know if you've noticed, but folks just
ain't makin' deposits on a Wednesday no more.

272
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:20,052
If I don't get some water
I'm gonna lose my ranch,

273
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,025
and you're tellin' me that's all
that's left in the whole tank!

274
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,375
Now, that just don't make no sense.

275
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:30,024
Now, listen. Someone is
dumpin' water in the desert.

276
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:33,179
I've seen it with my own eyes!

277
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:39,746
Water in the desert! Was this durin'
one of your...special times?

278
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:44,699
No! - Well, we can all dream.
But this is the reality.

279
00:25:45,074 --> 00:25:48,624
Why do you think so many people
are sellin' out? They just can't make it.

280
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:51,065
Well...I...what am I supposed to do?

281
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:54,281
Well, I suppose we could talk to the Mayor.

282
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,708
I hear he's been helpin'
people out in this time of crisis.

283
00:25:59,345 --> 00:26:00,554
The Mayor?
- He may be...our only hope.

284
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:03,874
...bullet hits the shovel, richochets back
towards number three

285
00:26:04,306 --> 00:26:07,190
and that's where the roof gave in
ingiting with a pure green alcohol

286
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:09,857
instantly vaporized his bodily form
into nothing but

287
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:13,819
a charcoal statute
and high-ptiched squeel.

288
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:22,172
Ho-hold on there. That's only six.
What happend to number seven?

289
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:27,773
Number seven? Damn...
Died of infection.

290
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,885
One bullet...

291
00:26:31,885 --> 00:26:34,166
All seven men.

292
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,601
Dance for me!
Dance like a real chicken!

293
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,867
Dance, dance.

294
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:47,781
You got coal in your ears, mate? You don't
pay the mortgage, you don't own the land!

295
00:26:47,781 --> 00:26:51,083
That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Your broke law!

296
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:56,037
If I see you're face in this town again
I'm gonna slice it off.

297
00:26:56,037 --> 00:27:00,038
And use it to wipe my unmentionables....
- Mind the beak.

298
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:03,586
And don't come back!!!

299
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:08,576
What are you all coping at?

300
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:14,401
Hey, Bad Bill, there's something
I gotta tell ya...

301
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:24,450
Oi, what is this?
- You know who this is, Bill? It's Rango!

302
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:28,098
Yeah! He ain't afraid of you.
He ain't afraid of any of you.

303
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:31,208
Killed them Jenkins brothers.
- Done it with one bullet, Bill...

304
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,166
All seven of them!

305
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,807
Is that right...

306
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:13,228
Lemme get that for you.

307
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:19,466
Eh... No! I know. Here.

308
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:26,094
Just will care 'bout that
for you...

309
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:28,273
Here! All better!

310
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,939
Here, here...
just a second...

311
00:28:56,334 --> 00:29:01,134
All right, listen. I wanna give you fellas
one last chance to reconsider.

312
00:29:05,564 --> 00:29:08,556
And if you don't wanna reconsider,

313
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:12,920
I might consider
reconsidering myself.

314
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:24,458
Now, that's what I'm
talking about!

315
00:29:24,951 --> 00:29:29,493
Yeah. All right now, listen up! Things
gonna be different now Rango's in town.

316
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:34,988
Got some new rules; my shoe shined every
mornin', my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

317
00:29:35,411 --> 00:29:37,725
Whatever you do,
don't look me in the eye!

318
00:29:38,285 --> 00:29:41,054
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

319
00:29:41,648 --> 00:29:41,679
It's Rango!
- What's he up to?

320
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,981
He ain't afraid of nobody! - He's gonna
turn that bird butt-forward!

321
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,748
When you see me comin',
stand aside.

322
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:51,949
I take large steps and I don't want
your hey-sees bodily fluids on my boots!

323
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:59,802
Of course, there is no need for violence.
As long as we stick together, work as team.

324
00:29:59,802 --> 00:30:05,523
So I want you all
to come on outside, now.

325
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,251
Line up single file
while I take a recreation!

326
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:10,812
What's he doing now?
- I think it's A number two.

327
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:15,549
OCUPADO

328
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,170
Well, never mind!

329
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,978
You can best see
over here!

330
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,088
Look at him!
He's taking that hawk!

331
00:30:58,088 --> 00:30:59,769
Give him here,
Rango!

332
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:50,475
Did you see that?
- He killed than banger!

333
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:55,836
What do you...what do you
say, doc? - This hawk is dead!

334
00:32:55,836 --> 00:32:58,452
Shoo. I say we'd cook that
right out!

335
00:32:58,452 --> 00:33:01,418
He did it with one bullet!
- Well just like he said!

336
00:33:01,418 --> 00:33:05,819
It's about time
we had a hero around here!

337
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:06,333
One who ain't in a pine box...

338
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,105
I  think it's time he met the Mayor.

339
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:12,313
- You hear that, Rango?
You're gonna meet the Mayor.

340
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:14,741
Let's here it for Rango!

341
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:23,032
And so the stranger basks
in the adulation of his new friends.

342
00:33:23,032 --> 00:33:28,219
Sinking deeper into the
guacamole of his own deception.

343
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:33,020
When is he goin' to die?
- Soon, compadre. Soon.

344
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:50,074
<i>My land is not for sale!</i>

345
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:53,944
I thank you would save our land,
not sell it!

346
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:57,625
I'm sure we'd work out something
if you just talked to him...

347
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,406
Beans, where're you going?
Beans!

348
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,220
The Mayor will see you now.

349
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:11,377
Water, Mr. Rango, water.

350
00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:14,947
Without it, there's nothing
but dust and decay.

351
00:34:14,947 --> 00:34:19,075
But with water... there's life.

352
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:25,833
Look at them! They're so desperate to live
they'll follow it anywhere...

353
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,403
That's the immutable law
of the desert.

354
00:34:30,345 --> 00:34:34,261
Control the water and
you control everything else.

355
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:39,483
This is from my private stock.
Vintage rain water, from the Great Deluge.

356
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:44,124
Oh, not Noah's deluge.
Goodness, I'm not that old!

357
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,950
I guess power has some privileges.
- You made the good point, son.

358
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:54,859
But with privilege comes
responsibility.

359
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:59,617
Hell, I was Mayor here before
there was the Dirt!

360
00:34:59,617 --> 00:35:02,252
I may be just a sentimental,
old turtle...

361
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:05,657
but I think there's a future to
this town

362
00:35:06,012 --> 00:35:08,057
and I hope you'll be part of it.

363
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:11,769
To Dirt!
- To Dirt!

364
00:35:14,386 --> 00:35:18,066
You see them, Mr. Rango?
All my friends and neighbours?

365
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:22,727
It's a hard life here...
Very hard...

366
00:35:22,727 --> 00:35:26,312
Do you know how they make it
through each and every day?

367
00:35:26,312 --> 00:35:30,934
They believe. They believe
it's going to be better.

368
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:34,390
They believe that the water
will come!

369
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,993
They believe against all odds
and all evidence

370
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,361
that tomorrow will be
better than today.

371
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:43,718
People have to believe in
something.

372
00:35:44,182 --> 00:35:47,942
Right now,
they believe in you.

373
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:51,257
Pick it up, Mr. Rango.

374
00:35:51,554 --> 00:35:53,794
Your destiny awaits.

375
00:35:56,584 --> 00:35:59,824
People have to believe in
something.

376
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:06,259
It just don't make no sense.

377
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:10,252
This whole town is drying up
and the Mayor seems

378
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:11,852
the only one who's not affected!

379
00:36:11,852 --> 00:36:12,172
Don't that make you just
a wee bit suspicious?

380
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:16,357
What about that water I saw out
in the desert? I seen it with my own eyes!

381
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:19,775
Alright! No need to insight anxiety.
I'll inquire about the Mayor.

382
00:36:19,775 --> 00:36:26,340
If you really feel there's some conspiracy,
I suggest you take it up with the sheriff!

383
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,971
Excuse me, Mr Rango?

384
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:34,808
I will blow that ugly right off your face!
- Uh...I was just thinkin' that uh..

385
00:36:34,808 --> 00:36:39,201
Oh! You want the old John Hancock,
do you? Well, here hold this.

386
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:43,824
This isn't a social call! - Oh,
I know all about the all dig...

387
00:36:43,824 --> 00:36:45,824
I ordered myself some
nice fancy-dandies.

388
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:48,735
G. Rango! - You too? No problems, just...
- I need you to investigate...

389
00:36:48,735 --> 00:36:51,470
You know Beans, I bet you clean up
real nice if you put a little effort into it.

390
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:54,765
Son, stay in school, eat your veggies,
burn everything but Shakespear.

391
00:36:55,164 --> 00:36:59,682
Who...who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango! If that is your real name!

392
00:36:59,988 --> 00:37:02,868
I am tryin' to save my daddy's ranch,
which is on the verge

393
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:05,777
of an agricultural meltdown while
you're playin' patty cake with each...

394
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,547
Sad girl...
Such a drabbly pain..

395
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:13,214
Why does she do that?

396
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:16,283
It's a survival reflex.
- 'xcept her switch is just broken.

397
00:37:16,283 --> 00:37:17,981
Well! That's an inconvenience.

398
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:20,638
It is not a rash!
It is a birth mark.

399
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:24,128
I did it again, didn't I?
- Did what?

400
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,492
Let me ask you something...

401
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:30,304
Did anybody here mention to you
what happened to our last sheriff?

402
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:14,554
Uh...May I ask you...the last sheriff.
Pardon me...

403
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:18,046
Where did everybody go?
What happened to him?

404
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:56,880
Oh...oh... I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

405
00:39:07,474 --> 00:39:11,003
his is heck of a hoedown you got goin'.
Still workin' out those steps.

406
00:39:11,003 --> 00:39:13,500
So, is this considered
normal civic behavior?

407
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,882
Mmhmm. Every Wednesday.
Just like clock work.

408
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:22,053
You kill bird? - Yea, ha...
as a matter of fact, I did.

409
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:24,585
Bird dead. Snake come.

410
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:27,501
Is it snake? - He means
Rattlesnake Jake, Mr Rango.

411
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:31,031
He wasn't coming to town because
he was scared of that hawk.

412
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:33,592
but might come now. May I have
your boots when you're dead?

413
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:38,014
No! Rango's got no problem with this Rattlesnake
Jake. - That's exactly what Amos said.

414
00:39:38,014 --> 00:39:39,575
Amos?

415
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:42,204
Sheriff AMOS
Thursday - Friday

416
00:39:42,658 --> 00:39:44,308
You got any gold fillings?

417
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,255
My fellow Dirtonians!

418
00:40:05,255 --> 00:40:11,136
I welcome you to this great day
of deliverance! Halellujah! - Halellujah!

419
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:15,495
Acolytes, prepare
the holly spigot!

420
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:31,345
We have a newcomer amongst us,
a man I think needs little introduction

421
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:35,412
to you, so bold has been his entry
into our fair society.

422
00:40:35,412 --> 00:40:38,174
Mr. Rango?
Would you step forward?

423
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:40,255
Mine!
- Mine!

424
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:49,282
The time has come! The time
that was foretold! - Hallelujah!

425
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:52,349
The sacred time!
- Hallelujah!

426
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:57,006
The time of destiny!
- Hallelujah!

427
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:59,922
The time of deliverance!
- Hallelujah!

428
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:05,100
It is the time of...
hydration!

429
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,543
It's his fault! - It's the newcomer!
- Burn him!

430
00:41:22,971 --> 00:41:25,042
He's a witch!
- I want his boots!

431
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:28,715
My friends! My friends!
Temper your frustrations.

432
00:41:29,002 --> 00:41:33,612
Times will be tough from now on.
Sacrifices have to be made.

433
00:41:33,873 --> 00:41:37,703
But if I can help in any way,
please know that my door is always...

434
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:41,573
Hold it! hold it! Now this whole
thing stinks three ways to Sunday!

435
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,482
First the bank's run dry,
and now this here spigot!

436
00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:46,269
Bank's run dry?
- What's she talkin' about?

437
00:41:46,735 --> 00:41:48,701
She said there's no
water in the bank!

438
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:52,998
I want mine in cash!

439
00:41:54,457 --> 00:41:57,386
We can't just give away...
- We can't move again!

440
00:41:59,731 --> 00:42:03,977
There'll be no civil disobedience
in my town. Thank you very much!

441
00:42:06,054 --> 00:42:09,348
Thank Goodness you're here, sheriff.
Things were getting outta hand!

442
00:42:09,954 --> 00:42:11,395
Ooo... come right in,
join us.

443
00:42:11,852 --> 00:42:16,350
Well now! Let me get the source
of the societal discontentment here.

444
00:42:17,248 --> 00:42:19,808
Go..ho...hod, have mercy...

445
00:42:20,682 --> 00:42:24,409
All right. Listen up! I've been thinkin'
and I believe I figured somethin' out.

446
00:42:24,782 --> 00:42:27,719
You folks have a water problem!

447
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:31,800
Now, just pay attention everybody!
I'm tryin' to make a point here.

448
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:34,531
Let's say this fella here were
to take a drink of water.

449
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:37,510
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul. Right?

450
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:44,212
And you! Why you're just as dried up
and parched as a Jack rabbit in July!

451
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:46,973
So you belly on up and
take you a double shot!

452
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,199
Stay with me...

453
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:53,152
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinkin'!

454
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:58,140
Before you know it,
there wouldn't be anymore water!

455
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,381
And then where would we be?

456
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:05,430
We'd be thirsty!
Real thirsty!

457
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:08,311
Why we'd turn on each other
like a bunch of animals!

458
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:15,814
Now, look here. We have got
six days of water...

459
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,740
Fi.. - We have got five
days of water.

460
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:28,450
As long as we got water,
we got ourselves a town.

461
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:34,210
Sheriff Rango is right. As long
as we have this water, we have some hope.

462
00:43:34,627 --> 00:43:37,326
And you can all take it from me.
My one hundred percent

463
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,858
full time employment from this moment
I'll protect our precious, natural, resource.

464
00:43:45,193 --> 00:43:47,583
Ain't no one gonna tango
with the Rango!

465
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:01,292
Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, sheriff.

466
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:05,974
Hold on their, Gordy.  Now you
get on back in there and assert yourself.

467
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:11,775
I think you'll find the people in this
town to be surprising hospitable.

468
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:12,876
Thank you, sheriff!

469
00:44:12,876 --> 00:44:14,619
What? Not you!

470
00:44:15,644 --> 00:44:17,644
I stand corrected.

471
00:44:23,317 --> 00:44:25,695
This ain't the bank!
- Hold you, Jedidiah!

472
00:44:25,695 --> 00:44:28,419
Hold it right there!
- It's the sheriff.

473
00:44:28,419 --> 00:44:30,606
Get them hands up
where I can see 'em.

474
00:44:30,606 --> 00:44:35,727
Just as I suspected. Prospecting
without authorized equipment!

475
00:44:36,094 --> 00:44:37,934
Don't move a muscle!
- Prospectors?

476
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:45,530
Now, here's the shovels, pickaxe, drills,
some snacks, puzzle works

477
00:44:45,868 --> 00:44:48,284
and you gonna need the permit.

478
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,478
Ezekiel! Jedidiah! What the
Sam hill's goin' on up there?

479
00:44:51,478 --> 00:44:54,999
I've had colobs removed
smarter than the two of you!

480
00:44:55,201 --> 00:45:00,072
Hells bar! This ain't the bank! - Pappy,
the Sheriff is standin' right here!

481
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,679
Helpin' us out.
- Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.

482
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:06,560
That's right, sir. Just doin' my duty.
The lonely constable on his rounds,

483
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:11,508
keepin' and eagle eye out
for meyham and malfeasance.

484
00:45:11,737 --> 00:45:14,177
Does he look like he sounds?
- Uhum.

485
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:20,676
If we was to hit the mother load,
being prospectors and such,

486
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,837
where would we deposit said annuity?

487
00:45:23,837 --> 00:45:29,095
Well, in Dirt we happen to have the finest
financial institution this side of Missouri.

488
00:45:30,114 --> 00:45:33,115
Protected mornin', noon and night
by yours truly.

489
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,486
Much obliged.

490
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:39,591
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!

491
00:45:39,591 --> 00:45:42,072
O, God Lord,
the bank's been robbed!

492
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:44,771
What's goin' on?
- I don't know. The water is gone!

493
00:45:44,771 --> 00:45:46,932
What's he sayin'?
- The bank's been robbed!

494
00:45:47,189 --> 00:45:50,629
Doctor Marks, I'm on fire,
embrace me!

495
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:55,667
<i>The bank's been robbed,
the town is striked...</i>

496
00:45:55,667 --> 00:46:00,188
<i>to die of thirst or equal,
what they thought is all his fault</i>

497
00:46:00,618 --> 00:46:04,070
All right folks, stand back, clear
the area, this is a crime scene now.

498
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,756
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints
and  fiber, scamper DNA

499
00:46:06,756 --> 00:46:09,595
I wanna urin sample from everyone
and get me a latte.

500
00:46:09,595 --> 00:46:11,053
Don't mix up the two...

501
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:15,503
What's this? Prospecting permit?
- I'll take that. Material evidence!

502
00:46:15,503 --> 00:46:18,228
What are we doin' now, sheriff?
- We need that water.

503
00:46:18,228 --> 00:46:23,254
We're all gonna die! - Friends,
we all know what we have to do.

504
00:46:23,254 --> 00:46:26,937
That's right. We all know
what we have to do now.

505
00:46:26,937 --> 00:46:28,858
And that would be?

506
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:31,290
(Form a posse).
- Form a possum"!

507
00:46:33,115 --> 00:46:34,955
A posse.

508
00:46:35,954 --> 00:46:39,114
Now we gonna be doing this
in orderly fashion.

509
00:46:39,114 --> 00:46:44,617
First of all, does anybody here know
how to use a firearm of any kind?

510
00:46:46,506 --> 00:46:48,116
All right then.

511
00:46:48,116 --> 00:46:49,797
What do we do now,
sheriff?

512
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:53,164
Now,...
we ride.

513
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:08,251
Where're we going?
- What?

514
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:10,923
Where're we going?

515
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:20,746
Now, as my deputy you'll be in charge
of all trackin' and findin' of villains.

516
00:47:21,191 --> 00:47:23,755
Utilizin'' your well developed ingenuity.
No offense taken.

517
00:47:24,171 --> 00:47:26,206
So which way do you think they went?
You wanna sniff the air...

518
00:47:26,547 --> 00:47:28,980
or commune
with a buffalo or somethin'?

519
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,211
Oh... you're good!

520
00:47:35,424 --> 00:47:39,836
I am depending on you, Spoons.
You got a little tobacco ih your beard.

521
00:47:39,836 --> 00:47:44,343
Always good to have a medical man on,
doc? - Reptiles gotta stick together!

522
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:48,133
Right, my brother? - I'm an amphibian.
- Ain't no shame in that...

523
00:47:49,052 --> 00:47:53,845
Woh! Are you sure you're fit for
duty there, soldier? - What?

524
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:57,309
Well, you gotta a little
something in your eye there...

525
00:47:57,824 --> 00:48:01,648
Oh, that! That there is conjunctivitis,
sir. It's hereditary.

526
00:48:02,598 --> 00:48:05,231
Oh... I'm glad to hear
it ain't contageous.

527
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,426
Now, just wait a cotton pickin' minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...

528
00:48:10,363 --> 00:48:11,584
Never mind.

529
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:14,657
Woh! Woh! Hold on there, little sister.
Someone's gonna have to look

530
00:48:15,043 --> 00:48:19,556
after the town while I'm gone.
- Can I get to shoot someone?

531
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,375
Uh...let's put a pin in that.

532
00:48:24,296 --> 00:48:28,487
Sheriff, you're gonna bring that water
back, aren't you?

533
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:29,427
Count on it, little sister.

534
00:48:30,596 --> 00:48:34,164
Which way do we go, sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere!

535
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:35,929
The whole town is purpurated
with them.

536
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:38,999
How'd them fellas found
the bank, anyways?

537
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:43,413
Khm...Gentlemen, if we can stay
on the task here? - Sheriff, over here.

538
00:48:46,845 --> 00:48:48,529
Would you look at that!

539
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:51,435
Like seeing the face of God!
-  Amen, brother.

540
00:48:51,797 --> 00:48:54,473
I remember when it used to flow
every Wednesday.

541
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,051
Those were the halcyon days...

542
00:48:57,457 --> 00:48:58,259
Must be a reason she quit
on us...

543
00:48:58,259 --> 00:49:01,789
Whatever the reason, someone
is controlling this here water!

544
00:49:01,789 --> 00:49:03,750
What do you say, sheriff?

545
00:49:04,553 --> 00:49:07,544
Clearly, the robbers came
from this direction.

546
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:12,417
I say we track this pipe
back to its hydraulic origin,

547
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:15,217
and apprehend the culprits
behind this aquatic conundrum.

548
00:49:15,217 --> 00:49:16,442
What'd he say? - I thin he said
follow the pipe. - He said follow the pipe.

549
00:49:27,727 --> 00:49:32,567
Whatever you do,
do not look down!

550
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:37,803
What is this place?
- It's an aquafor.

551
00:49:38,585 --> 00:49:42,825
Ah...What is aquafor?
- Well, it's for aqua.

552
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:45,381
Well, it's empy now!

553
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,170
Thank you, big one.

554
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:10,621
It's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.

555
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:14,189
Someone or something is
messing with our hydration.

556
00:50:14,189 --> 00:50:17,757
And that pipe has something
to do with it.

557
00:50:17,757 --> 00:50:19,957
Now, I thought we was following
bank robbers!

558
00:50:19,957 --> 00:50:20,136
We're experiencing a paradox shift!

559
00:50:20,136 --> 00:50:23,406
I'm gonna shift the features
on your face if you don't shut up!

560
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:28,779
Quite you savages! Stop your battlin'.
You're effectin' my cogitation.

561
00:50:30,957 --> 00:50:32,452
Wow! I got it!

562
00:50:32,452 --> 00:50:34,013
Snap out them torches!

563
00:50:40,718 --> 00:50:42,853
Smart thinking there,
fellow!

564
00:50:43,283 --> 00:50:45,757
Start climbing! - Get your boot
out of my face!

565
00:50:46,136 --> 00:50:48,365
Not bad, ha, Beans? - If you keep
thinking like that,

566
00:50:48,602 --> 00:50:50,775
your hat's gonna catch on fire.
- Well, you know...

567
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:55,175
You get on the road...
ahhh! Hot, hot, burn, ow...

568
00:51:04,577 --> 00:51:08,171
Poor things... All they wanted
was a little water.

569
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,611
Cactis dying of thirst?
They don't bold way...

570
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,756
Hey look what I've found!
- What'd you got?

571
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:15,579
I saw it first!
- It got some water!

572
00:51:15,911 --> 00:51:17,529
It's mine!
- Give me that!

573
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:21,287
Aaa...It's empty anyway.
- I knew that...

574
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,221
Hey, where'd you find that?
- Sheriff, you gonna wanna see this!

575
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,601
It's Mr. Merrymack,
from the bank.

576
00:51:31,092 --> 00:51:32,988
What's he doing here?
- Everybody stand back!

577
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:36,255
All right, lemme see it. - Looks like
them barriment shot him in the back!

578
00:51:36,657 --> 00:51:38,661
No...this man wasn't shot.

579
00:51:38,964 --> 00:51:40,717
He was drowned.

580
00:51:41,085 --> 00:51:43,044
Drowned?
- In the middle of the desert?

581
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:45,884
Oh, what a way to go...

582
00:51:46,446 --> 00:51:50,013
Well now... who's boot prints
are those?

583
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:58,437
That's interesting. Ground still wet...
- I suppose we should bury him...

584
00:51:58,786 --> 00:52:03,057
Oh, no...birds gotta eat too.
- Circle of life!

585
00:52:03,445 --> 00:52:08,281
Hey, what's that there dumb
Indian doin'?

586
00:52:10,745 --> 00:52:13,194
I see you're consulting
with the spirits.

587
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:16,385
No, I'm molting. Means
I'm ready to mate.

588
00:52:16,936 --> 00:52:19,241
Oh. I'll keep that in mind.

589
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,439
Cactus fruit.

590
00:52:21,828 --> 00:52:23,553
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit!

591
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:26,725
I believe you people use it as seasoning
while preparing your native dishes.

592
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,527
Also natural laxative.

593
00:52:30,178 --> 00:52:34,925
Pick up trail. Three men, headed west.
One blind. One with...

594
00:52:35,707 --> 00:52:38,902
...a large prostate, riding side saddle.

595
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,325
What...What'd he say?
- They're ridin' side saddle!

596
00:52:41,718 --> 00:52:43,350
What? - Sshh! We're whisperin'.
- What'd he say?

597
00:52:43,824 --> 00:52:45,393
Someone's got a bad south.

598
00:52:45,776 --> 00:52:47,987
All right. Which one of you
fellas need a check up?

599
00:52:48,346 --> 00:52:49,904
Awkward.

600
00:52:51,157 --> 00:52:54,275
Aaa...what exactly are we
gonna do now?

601
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:58,280
Now? We ride.

602
00:53:00,779 --> 00:53:05,120
That means we're riding now!
This moment.

603
00:53:45,715 --> 00:53:48,191
Marshmallows remind me of
goin' campin' with my daddy.

604
00:53:48,624 --> 00:53:50,277
I could eat 'em all night long.

605
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:55,289
Of course, he did make me cough
'em back up again for breakfast.

606
00:53:56,988 --> 00:54:00,119
This one time,
I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

607
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,132
That ain't nothin'.
I coughed up a whole tribe of Pygmies.

608
00:54:04,644 --> 00:54:06,919
They started lookin' at me weird.

609
00:54:07,459 --> 00:54:09,669
I remember them.
They was quit friendly.

610
00:54:10,118 --> 00:54:13,857
I found a human spinal column
in my fecal matter once.

611
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:18,574
You might wanna get
that looked at.

612
00:54:19,648 --> 00:54:21,346
Pass the beans,
Beans.

613
00:54:21,946 --> 00:54:23,859
Sheriff?
- No, thanks...

614
00:54:24,398 --> 00:54:27,867
Mr. Rango, can you tell us
about the Spirit of the West?

615
00:54:28,382 --> 00:54:31,145
Oh, yes, talk about that?
- Is it true what they say?

616
00:54:32,675 --> 00:54:37,809
Ah...yes...the Spirit of the West.
The eternally unobtainable eye view.

617
00:54:38,225 --> 00:54:42,257
They say he rides in an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

618
00:54:43,257 --> 00:54:46,801
But he only appears to those
who have undertaken an epic quest...

619
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,916
and have made it to the other side.

620
00:54:53,653 --> 00:54:55,942
Uh... Other side of what?

621
00:54:56,314 --> 00:55:00,458
It's a metaphore. - My eye!
- Uh...that's gonna heal right up.

622
00:55:01,892 --> 00:55:04,960
Sheriff, what're you going to do
about Rattlesnake Jake?

623
00:55:05,172 --> 00:55:07,873
Hm? What? Where!?

624
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:11,755
Sorry 'bout that. Word is, you come
against him once or twice.

625
00:55:12,163 --> 00:55:15,374
Ooh! Yeah! Jake!
You mean, my brother.

626
00:55:15,804 --> 00:55:18,297
Your brother?
- That's what I said!

627
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:21,129
But... he's a snake and
you're a lizard.

628
00:55:21,514 --> 00:55:24,155
Well, mamma had an active...
social life.

629
00:55:24,645 --> 00:55:27,814
Did he ever bite you? - Sure enough
did. Look at that baby.

630
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:32,918
Go ahead. You can touch it.  - Oh.
That's interesting. It's a belly button.

631
00:55:33,282 --> 00:55:36,446
Luckily I'm immune to his venom. Put
some in my coffee to get a little tang.

632
00:55:36,813 --> 00:55:38,876
Is it true he's only scared of
them hawks?

633
00:55:39,285 --> 00:55:43,082
Them is what we call -
natural predators.

634
00:55:43,482 --> 00:55:46,568
All this talk about them devils is
splitting my queels on edge!

635
00:55:46,923 --> 00:55:49,846
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir!
- Don't you all worry 'bout a thing.

636
00:55:50,245 --> 00:55:54,711
Come tomorrow we'll locate that water
and return to a hero as well!

637
00:55:55,155 --> 00:56:00,014
Friends, before we bunk down,
I'd like us all to join hands for a moments.

638
00:56:00,351 --> 00:56:02,800
Say a few words
to the Spirit of the West...

639
00:56:03,195 --> 00:56:05,009
Good idea.

640
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:09,387
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West,

641
00:56:10,189 --> 00:56:15,351
but tonight I wanna thank you for
bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

642
00:56:15,698 --> 00:56:20,471
It's a hard life we got. Sometimes
I don't know how we're gonna make it,

643
00:56:20,908 --> 00:56:24,543
but somehow Sheriff Rango
makes me think we will.

644
00:56:24,842 --> 00:56:28,229
We needed a brave man
and you sent us one.

645
00:56:28,548 --> 00:56:31,274
Nice to have someone
to believe in again.

646
00:56:31,704 --> 00:56:35,654
Thank you,
Spirit of the West. Amen.

647
00:56:35,982 --> 00:56:38,106
Amen.

648
00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:10,897
Just checkin'...

649
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:16,906
It's so cold tonight.
- Thank you.

650
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:20,431
You ever feel like
those things are lookin' at you?

651
00:57:20,863 --> 00:57:24,858
That's a Spanish Dagger. But around here
we just call 'em the Walkin' Cactus.

652
00:57:25,338 --> 00:57:30,034
Walking? - There's an old legend they
actually walk across the desert to find water.

653
00:57:30,453 --> 00:57:33,750
When I was a little girl I'd stay up
late watchin' if they move.

654
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:37,456
I thought if I could follow them,
they'd lead me to some place wonderful.

655
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:41,913
Some place with enough water
for everyone...

656
00:57:42,285 --> 00:57:47,065
Night after night I watched 'em.
I never saw 'em move.

657
00:57:47,404 --> 00:57:51,652
But you're still watching? - Who didn't
wanna find some place wonderful?

658
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:55,843
We'll find the water, Beans.
I promise you.

659
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,736
That's such a lonely sound.

660
00:58:01,117 --> 00:58:04,145
You ever get lonely?
- Sometimes.

661
00:58:04,507 --> 00:58:09,238
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer
and everyone likes you so much.

662
00:58:09,563 --> 00:58:13,225
I never made friends easily
like that. - No?

663
00:58:13,607 --> 00:58:15,768
No. We're pretty isolated
out there on the ranch.

664
00:58:16,184 --> 00:58:18,301
Sorta of like being sealed up
in a little box.

665
00:58:18,881 --> 00:58:21,794
Don't really see uh...a lot of folks.

666
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,421
I wouldn't know what that's like.

667
00:58:24,789 --> 00:58:27,505
Is there someone special
in your life, Rango?

668
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:30,209
Oh! Well, there used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.

669
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:32,875
Besides... My life's too dangerous
for that kind of thing.

670
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:35,938
You know, it's an awful solitary
existence out there on the prairie.

671
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:38,696
Ridin' the ranges and the such like...

672
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,558
Beans?

673
00:59:04,606 --> 00:59:08,010
Disfunctional family...
Need intervention.

674
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:11,006
What's that coming?

675
00:59:11,874 --> 00:59:14,892
It's the water!

676
00:59:15,899 --> 00:59:19,616
I have a plan! And each and every
one of you has a part to play.

677
00:59:20,022 --> 00:59:23,131
What do I do? - Spoons, you've got
the most important job of all!

678
00:59:23,514 --> 00:59:25,659
You will stay up here on the ridge,
and if anything goes wrong,

679
00:59:26,086 --> 00:59:28,712
you give... the signal.

680
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:38,559
Muh. Mmmuh!
Mmmmuh! Hmmmuh!

681
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:41,440
Beans, what size of dress
you're wearing?

682
00:59:41,889 --> 00:59:44,063
I've done it!
- Hallelujah!

683
00:59:44,434 --> 00:59:46,235
I have the water!
- You did it, son.

684
00:59:46,636 --> 00:59:49,421
Well, actually...
- Why can't you be like your brother?

685
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:52,184
Pappy, about that water, there's
something I gotta tell you...

686
00:59:52,566 --> 00:59:55,811
Hush! Hush up now!
Somebody's comin'!

687
00:59:57,031 --> 00:59:59,696
Gracious! Good afternoon
to thee and thee and thee!

688
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:05,346
May I present my Madame Repones steps
accordion troops of travelling thespians!

689
01:00:05,778 --> 01:00:08,141
What is that?
- I think they's thespians!.

690
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,930
Thespians!
That's illegal in seven states.

691
01:00:11,535 --> 01:00:14,567
The stage is set, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

692
01:00:15,001 --> 01:00:16,614
I yearn for love.

693
01:00:17,017 --> 01:00:19,931
Meanwhile, the lone centry
stands and watch at the castle gate.

694
01:00:20,453 --> 01:00:22,320
Hark! Who goes there?

695
01:00:22,963 --> 01:00:25,777
This plots highly predictable!!
- Quite! This is my favorite part!

696
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:29,697
Arriving to great phanphare
was her aging father.

697
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,313
Strike a spike, Cupid.

698
01:00:34,777 --> 01:00:39,879
Ergh... pretty... unhand... my fair daughter.
And reach for the...

699
01:00:40,899 --> 01:00:44,177
Line? Reach for the sky!

700
01:00:45,871 --> 01:00:49,280
Wha... what was that? - Must
be one of them immersive talers.

701
01:00:49,568 --> 01:00:51,225
We got you surrounded!

702
01:00:51,627 --> 01:00:53,947
You and your entire family get your
hands up where I can see 'em.

703
01:00:54,341 --> 01:00:57,454
Ha, my entire family?

704
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:21,408
O, it's a full house!

705
01:01:21,738 --> 01:01:25,891
Looks like we gonna have ourselves
a good oldfashioned stand-off.

706
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:29,716
I'll have you know you are not
looking at our entire continuing.

707
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:39,990
Wha...What's that? What's that
supposed to be? - That's the signal.

708
01:01:40,391 --> 01:01:43,727
That's the signal. Something
must have gone wrong!

709
01:01:47,238 --> 01:01:50,943
So...uhm, something's
supposed to happen?

710
01:01:51,454 --> 01:01:54,570
I ... am... open to suggestions.

711
01:02:01,242 --> 01:02:03,333
Run!

712
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:10,473
Get on the wagon!

713
01:02:16,227 --> 01:02:18,970
Do we have ourselves some
sport turns?

714
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:25,454
Ha...I likes it when they run.
- Mabel, give the holler!

715
01:02:30,652 --> 01:02:33,927
Looks like we've made it!
- They're on into to square spots?

716
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,300
Yea! I hope them conmen to
spook right out!

717
01:03:03,048 --> 01:03:04,709
They got bats!

718
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:07,439
Oh...Here, you drive.

719
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:18,639
Looks like it's gonna be
soft dinner, come on!

720
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:31,413
You damnation!
Don't shoot the water!

721
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:36,143
Jedidiah, it's time for the
Alabaman squeeze-box! - OK, paps.

722
01:03:42,878 --> 01:03:46,393
I'm sensing hostility.
- They're coming!

723
01:03:50,922 --> 01:03:53,739
Helloo!
- Good bye!

724
01:04:02,878 --> 01:04:05,902
Lassoo that swag!

725
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:28,766
I suggest we take the days of
action! - Just shut up and shoot!

726
01:04:29,143 --> 01:04:31,500
What happened to the sheriff?
- They got him.

727
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:35,071
Bosefus, give 'em some
jumbo now!

728
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:43,108
What was that?
Go, check it out.

729
01:04:44,183 --> 01:04:46,963
What is it?
Is there a problem?

730
01:04:47,645 --> 01:04:49,988
Ah... you can count on that.

731
01:05:35,962 --> 01:05:37,718
Headache!

732
01:05:39,188 --> 01:05:41,655
Is that all you got?

733
01:05:58,238 --> 01:06:01,556
That was not yet that unpleasant!

734
01:06:13,806 --> 01:06:15,986
Hey, here! Hold this!

735
01:06:24,759 --> 01:06:27,067
You get your hands of me!

736
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:38,275
Hold on!

737
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,164
Jump!

738
01:07:04,507 --> 01:07:06,057
That's impossible!

739
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:09,167
It can't be.
It's empty.

740
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:11,142
There's no water!

741
01:07:11,608 --> 01:07:14,429
No water? What the hell have we
been fightin' for?

742
01:07:14,884 --> 01:07:18,628
Sir! You have defauled and desacrated
the very sustainance of our livelihood.

743
01:07:18,964 --> 01:07:21,456
I think that part
in that dress is the sheriff.

744
01:07:21,832 --> 01:07:23,972
That's the same fella who gave us
the prospecting permit?

745
01:07:24,513 --> 01:07:26,782
A what!?
- Irelevant! Confiscation!

746
01:07:27,158 --> 01:07:29,037
You and your kin are
under arrest for bank robbery

747
01:07:29,376 --> 01:07:31,153
and the murder of our beloved
financial advisor

748
01:07:31,491 --> 01:07:34,281
Johannes Merymack III,
a.k.a ... Fluffy Joe.

749
01:07:34,702 --> 01:07:37,020
Sheriff, we ain't killed nobody.
We tunelled into that vault,

750
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:39,042
but there was nothing
in it.

751
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,074
Someone robbed that bank
before we robbed it.

752
01:07:41,379 --> 01:07:43,111
Where did you get this here jag?

753
01:07:43,384 --> 01:07:45,712
That's what I was tryin' to tell
you pappy. I found it the desert.

754
01:07:46,098 --> 01:07:48,935
Then why darn it did you
bring it here?

755
01:07:49,378 --> 01:07:52,368
Hold on! You're saying this here
jug was empty when you found it?

756
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:55,012
Aha, that's right!
- Nah, I don't believe a word of him!

757
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:57,130
Let's hang him, sheriff.
- Spring him up!

758
01:07:57,451 --> 01:08:00,114
Who would take the water into
the desert? - Wouldn't be the first time...

759
01:08:00,602 --> 01:08:03,082
It's a puzzle!
Like a bit of mammagram!

760
01:08:03,534 --> 01:08:06,086
What's goin' on sheriff?
- I don't know.

761
01:08:06,522 --> 01:08:09,970
But I'm gonna strip away this mistery
and expose its private parts!

762
01:08:10,467 --> 01:08:12,467
You and your kin are
comin' with me.

763
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:18,606
They're coming.

764
01:08:18,874 --> 01:08:20,824
Here they come.

765
01:08:21,213 --> 01:08:23,200
Looks like they caught
the robbers.

766
01:08:44,827 --> 01:08:46,799
Where's the water?

767
01:08:49,064 --> 01:08:51,556
There weren't no water.

768
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,397
Where is he going?

769
01:09:06,983 --> 01:09:10,075
He's going to see the Mayor...

770
01:09:11,217 --> 01:09:15,002
Aaa...he's gotta be pleased with
that, yea! - That's a good one, boss.

771
01:09:24,765 --> 01:09:26,375
Interesting...

772
01:09:26,838 --> 01:09:28,820
I do apologize for the shoes,
Mr. Rango,

773
01:09:29,216 --> 01:09:34,157
but there's certain protocol to this game.
And I'm a bit of strict for protocol.

774
01:09:34,624 --> 01:09:38,907
That's good. 'Cause you gotta few questions
answering, and I got my own protocol.

775
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:46,551
But why would anyone dump water
in the bloomin' desert?

776
01:09:46,968 --> 01:09:50,199
It does seem a bit naive taking
the word of admitted bank robbers.

777
01:09:50,609 --> 01:09:53,363
Besides, once they hanged,
your job is done.

778
01:09:53,812 --> 01:09:55,688
Bravo! - Job well done!

779
01:09:56,077 --> 01:09:58,430
But what if someone did rob the
bank before they got there?

780
01:09:58,832 --> 01:10:02,302
And who would do that, Mr. Rango?
- I was hoping that you could tell me.

781
01:10:02,793 --> 01:10:05,328
That sounds marshally near to an
accusation.

782
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:07,375
Take it anyway you like it.

783
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,672
Something you said keeps
rattling 'round my frontal lobe.

784
01:10:15,987 --> 01:10:17,825
What's that?

785
01:10:18,374 --> 01:10:22,064
"Control the water,
and you control everything."

786
01:10:22,544 --> 01:10:26,715
Come on, Mr. Rango!
You tribute divine power to me!

787
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:30,648
How on Earth could I possibly
control the water?

788
01:10:32,246 --> 01:10:38,575
You obviously mastered this game.
- Well...I've been playing it for many years.

789
01:10:38,869 --> 01:10:41,719
I was here before the highway
split this great valley.

790
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:47,207
I watched the march of progress.
And I learned a thing or two.

791
01:10:47,646 --> 01:10:50,857
Perhaps it's time you started
to take a long view.

792
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:54,702
You'd begin to appreciate the
broad sweep of history.

793
01:10:55,065 --> 01:11:01,288
Look out there, son. You can
almost see time passing.

794
01:11:02,803 --> 01:11:08,195
What're you building out here?
Future, Mr. Rango, future.

795
01:11:08,589 --> 01:11:11,744
One day soon, all this is going to
faint into myth.

796
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:14,594
the frontier town, the lawmen,
the gunslinger...

797
01:11:15,792 --> 01:11:18,876
There's just no place for them
anymore. We're civilized now.

798
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,052
That's right, civilized.

799
01:11:21,419 --> 01:11:22,970
That's what the future holds.

800
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:26,235
You can either be part of it
or you can be left behind.

801
01:11:26,714 --> 01:11:30,218
Is that what happened to Mr. Merrymack?
Did he get left behind?

802
01:11:30,923 --> 01:11:34,569
Careful, Mr. Rango. You seem to
forget you're just one little lizard.

803
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:39,267
You seem to forget -
I'm the law 'round these parts.

804
01:11:40,961 --> 01:11:43,964
Our new sheriff's been playing
the hero for so long

805
01:11:44,363 --> 01:11:46,459
he has actually started
to believe it.

806
01:11:46,896 --> 01:11:49,163
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

807
01:11:49,643 --> 01:11:53,574
Jake's the Grim Reaper. He'll never
leave a rat without ruining his soul!

808
01:11:53,881 --> 01:11:56,085
Do it!

809
01:12:09,104 --> 01:12:13,165
Now be still. You gotta look presentable.
Going to meet your Maker.

810
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:21,637
<i>La muerte allegado,
death has arrived.</i>

811
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:30,384
<i> Como estanto suevos?
How will the hero survive?</i>

812
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:39,045
The Mayor has bought all of the
land in the valley. Except yours, Miss Beans.

813
01:12:39,382 --> 01:12:43,205
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

814
01:12:43,649 --> 01:12:47,267
Unless he controls the water!
Like a monkey's bladder!

815
01:12:47,677 --> 01:12:49,892
Then he can bring it back once
he bought up all the land.

816
01:12:50,219 --> 01:12:52,177
And then how does he control
the water?

817
01:12:52,592 --> 01:12:54,842
Sheriff, we got a problem.

818
01:13:00,722 --> 01:13:04,445
Hold on, Beans, that
won't be necessary.

819
01:13:11,106 --> 01:13:12,562
Hang them!
- Tear them apart!

820
01:13:12,946 --> 01:13:14,348
Calm down.
Calm down!

821
01:13:15,419 --> 01:13:17,004
Let them pay the price!

822
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:18,953
We can smack down
their gimmicks!

823
01:13:19,348 --> 01:13:21,261
You too, Spoons?

824
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:24,246
They're done taking that water.
They'd taken everything we got.

825
01:13:24,584 --> 01:13:26,454
No one to hang anyone up.
Not while I'm the sheriff.

826
01:13:26,775 --> 01:13:28,285
But it's all his fault!

827
01:13:28,615 --> 01:13:30,551
You said you was going
to bring the water...

828
01:13:30,999 --> 01:13:35,011
It's just we got no hope without that
water.- We got nothing left to believe.

829
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,228
You see that sign up there?

830
01:13:37,631 --> 01:13:40,176
As long as that sign says "sheriff",
you can believe

831
01:13:40,527 --> 01:13:42,508
there's law and order in this town!

832
01:13:42,978 --> 01:13:45,251
But without law and order!
Luminate on that!

833
01:13:45,689 --> 01:13:48,606
Oh, yea! Starts out slow...
like a... fungus.

834
01:13:48,954 --> 01:13:51,471
Somebody says a cross word,
accusations start climbin'...

835
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:54,249
neighbour turn on neighbour,
pretty soon we're eating our children

836
01:13:54,599 --> 01:13:56,388
and dogs and cats will get togehter
to create all sorts

837
01:13:56,691 --> 01:13:59,072
of unatural murant apparitions!

838
01:13:59,463 --> 01:14:02,482
So you want something to
believe in, Spoons?

839
01:14:02,962 --> 01:14:05,095
Believe in me.

840
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:08,507
Believe in that sign.

841
01:14:08,956 --> 01:14:12,508
As long as it hangs there,
we got hope.

842
01:14:36,367 --> 01:14:39,205
Hello, "brother".

843
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:41,754
Thirsty?

844
01:14:51,129 --> 01:14:53,794
Long time, brother.

845
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:59,451
How've you been keeping?
- Oh, well, you know...

846
01:14:59,956 --> 01:15:03,855
I heard all that turnabout how you
killed them Jenkins brothers.

847
01:15:04,329 --> 01:15:06,517
with one bullet,
wasn't it?

848
01:15:06,858 --> 01:15:08,967
Isn't that right?

849
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:13,025
All these good folks here believed
your little stories, don't they?

850
01:15:13,351 --> 01:15:16,396
Why, they believe you're
just a stone killer, don't they?

851
01:15:17,525 --> 01:15:20,059
Seems these folks trust you.

852
01:15:20,361 --> 01:15:22,739
They think you're gonna
save their little town.

853
01:15:23,157 --> 01:15:28,209
They think you're gonna
save their little souls.

854
01:15:29,589 --> 01:15:34,649
But we know better.
Don't we?

855
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:42,671
So why don't you show your friends
here what you're made of?

856
01:15:42,995 --> 01:15:45,533
Show 'em who you really are.

857
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,543
Why don't you just pull your
gun and shoot me?

858
01:15:48,906 --> 01:15:51,089
But of course, you won't need
all the bean...

859
01:15:51,442 --> 01:15:54,039
Just one, right?

860
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:58,694
Go ahead, hero.
Pull the trigger.

861
01:16:01,445 --> 01:16:04,627
You got killer in
your eyes, son?

862
01:16:05,698 --> 01:16:07,925
I don't see it.

863
01:16:09,935 --> 01:16:15,379
You didn't do any of them things
you said? You didn't kill Jenkins brothers?

864
01:16:15,724 --> 01:16:18,779
You ain't even from the West,
are you?

865
01:16:19,114 --> 01:16:21,020
Say it!

866
01:16:21,482 --> 01:16:25,688
No. - O, speak up.  I don't think
your friends here heard you.

867
01:16:27,804 --> 01:16:33,536
No. - All you done is lied to these good people.
You ain't nothing but a freak and a coward.

868
01:16:33,824 --> 01:16:35,964
Isn't that right?

869
01:16:36,318 --> 01:16:39,584
Yes. - Louder!
- Yes.

870
01:16:42,381 --> 01:16:48,378
Listen closely, you pathetic
fraud. This is my town.

871
01:16:48,892 --> 01:16:53,876
If I ever see you again, I'll take
your soul straight down to hell!

872
01:17:08,698 --> 01:17:11,120
Who are you?

873
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:48,995
<i>Who am I?</i>

874
01:18:50,072 --> 01:18:52,294
<i>I am nobody.</i>

875
01:20:31,406 --> 01:20:34,857
Golden guardians!

876
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:38,538
The alabaster carriage!

877
01:20:41,364 --> 01:20:45,539
The Spirit of the West!

878
01:20:48,867 --> 01:20:53,084
Excuse me... Mister...
Spirit? Sir?

879
01:20:53,999 --> 01:20:57,181
Aaa...here's the beauty. Sometimes
you gotta dig deep

880
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,538
to find what you're
looking for.

881
01:21:00,824 --> 01:21:02,968
So you made it...

882
01:21:03,534 --> 01:21:05,554
Is this Heaven?

883
01:21:05,907 --> 01:21:08,964
If it were, we'd be eating
Pop-Tarts with Kim Novak.

884
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:11,755
Yea...ha...no kidding?

885
01:21:12,097 --> 01:21:15,684
What are you doing out here?
- Searching...same as you.

886
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,915
I don't even know what I'm
looking for.

887
01:21:20,185 --> 01:21:22,486
I don't even know
who I am.

888
01:21:22,931 --> 01:21:25,526
And they used to call you
"The Man with Name".

889
01:21:25,926 --> 01:21:29,201
These days, they gotta a name
for just about everything.

890
01:21:29,555 --> 01:21:33,454
It doesn't matter what they call
you, it's the deeds, that make the man.

891
01:21:33,885 --> 01:21:37,147
But my deeds just made things worse.
I'm a fraud. I'm a phoney!

892
01:21:37,453 --> 01:21:41,177
My friends believed in me, but
they need some kinda hero...

893
01:21:41,514 --> 01:21:45,029
Then be a hero.
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

894
01:21:45,308 --> 01:21:47,919
I'm not even supposed
to be here. - That's right.

895
01:21:48,235 --> 01:21:51,842
You came a long way to find
something that isn't out here.

896
01:21:52,148 --> 01:21:55,188
Don't you see?
It's not about you.

897
01:21:55,507 --> 01:21:58,724
It's about them.

898
01:21:59,886 --> 01:22:05,103
But I can't go back... - You don't
know that you gotta choice, son.

899
01:22:07,101 --> 01:22:11,591
No man can walk out on his
own story.

900
01:22:21,528 --> 01:22:24,386
So, you made it.

901
01:22:24,753 --> 01:22:28,907
That's right, amigo.
The other side of the road.

902
01:22:30,508 --> 01:22:33,598
Did you just see that?

903
01:22:33,967 --> 01:22:40,076
We all see what we need to see.
Beautiful, isn't it?

904
01:22:50,453 --> 01:22:54,000
Yes... It is.

905
01:22:54,395 --> 01:22:58,508
Come, my friend.
I want to show you something.

906
01:23:01,146 --> 01:23:05,972
Many years ago, this entire valley
was covered in aqua.

907
01:23:07,052 --> 01:23:09,878
Now... only one question
remains:

908
01:23:10,868 --> 01:23:12,929
Where did it go?

909
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:48,269
They follow the water.

910
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:51,779
They follow the water!
Come on!

911
01:24:25,066 --> 01:24:29,588
<i>It just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.</i>

912
01:24:29,968 --> 01:24:32,085
<i>What are you building
out there?</i>

913
01:24:32,543 --> 01:24:34,471
<i>The future, Mr. Rango.</i>

914
01:24:34,838 --> 01:24:39,230
<i>You can either be part of it,
or you can be left behind.</i>

915
01:24:40,298 --> 01:24:44,247
<i>I was here before the highway
split this great valley.</i>

916
01:24:45,808 --> 01:24:50,871
<i>I watched the march of progress.
And I learned a thing or two.</i>

917
01:24:55,734 --> 01:25:00,524
<i>Control the water,
and you'll control everything.</i>

918
01:25:07,575 --> 01:25:11,567
<i>Come, now, Mr. Rango!
You tribute divine power to me!</i>

919
01:25:11,856 --> 01:25:16,025
<i>How on Earth could I
possibly control the water?</i>

920
01:25:40,377 --> 01:25:43,318
<b>EMMERGENCY SHUT OFF
valve 6</b>

921
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:51,535
What now, amigo?

922
01:25:57,857 --> 01:26:01,243
No man can walk out
of his own story.

923
01:26:02,153 --> 01:26:03,755
I'm going back.

924
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:06,838
But why?

925
01:26:07,455 --> 01:26:10,242
Because that's who I am.

926
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:26,270
You gotta lot of nerve showing up
here, lawman! What do you want?

927
01:26:26,777 --> 01:26:29,084
Your pappy and them boys are
'bout to hang for something

928
01:26:29,454 --> 01:26:32,949
they didn't do. But I have a plan.

929
01:27:00,104 --> 01:27:03,092
I appreciate how difficult this is
for you, Beans.

930
01:27:03,482 --> 01:27:05,879
But you're making a practical
decision.

931
01:27:06,385 --> 01:27:08,449
Decisions... Decisions...

932
01:27:08,883 --> 01:27:11,964
There is no need
for any more suffering...

933
01:27:17,737 --> 01:27:21,433
Your family's ranch is nothing
but a wasteland now.

934
01:27:21,844 --> 01:27:27,600
Sign the deed and relieve yourself
of your father's burden.

935
01:27:28,295 --> 01:27:30,930
My daddy was not a burden!

936
01:27:31,356 --> 01:27:34,783
Keep your blood money,
and I'll keep my land!

937
01:27:38,922 --> 01:27:41,915
Do what he says or by all
the fires of the black pit

938
01:27:42,308 --> 01:27:46,368
I'll squeeze them pretty brown
eyes right out of your skull!

939
01:27:46,771 --> 01:27:50,056
Now, hold on, Jake, there's no need...
- Let me do my job!

940
01:27:50,388 --> 01:27:53,955
You brought me here now we're
gonna play this sling out to the end.

941
01:27:54,541 --> 01:27:58,275
Sign the damn paper, woman!
- Go to hell!

942
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:01,451
Where do you think
I come from?

943
01:28:01,903 --> 01:28:04,155
Look into my eyes...

944
01:28:04,481 --> 01:28:07,405
I wanna see you die!

945
01:28:10,374 --> 01:28:13,674
Jake!

946
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:17,727
I'm calling you out!

947
01:28:19,516 --> 01:28:21,198
Jake!

948
01:28:21,742 --> 01:28:25,961
This day just got a
little more interesting.

949
01:28:51,402 --> 01:28:53,512
Put her down.

950
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:56,488
Or what, little man?
You gonna kill me?

951
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:00,316
That's just about the
size of it.

952
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:03,620
Get those filthy paws of me!
- Shut up your gob!

953
01:29:04,034 --> 01:29:07,226
All right, sheriff.
Make your move.

954
01:30:34,354 --> 01:30:36,847
Now, amigos!

955
01:30:40,128 --> 01:30:43,390
Pull! Pull!

956
01:30:59,169 --> 01:31:01,900
That was a bad idea.

957
01:31:05,388 --> 01:31:07,928
Thirsty, "Brother"?

958
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:14,043
It's coming!

959
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:22,209
This is a miracle!
- Hold on!

960
01:31:28,799 --> 01:31:31,294
Look, the water!
- What is that?

961
01:31:32,034 --> 01:31:33,756
It's our salvation, pappy!

962
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:37,640
It's our jailway going out!
We're gonna escape!

963
01:31:46,969 --> 01:31:50,902
I'm gonna blow so many holes
in your body, you're be leaking led!

964
01:31:51,316 --> 01:31:54,271
Then it's a good thing
I brought some back-up.

965
01:31:54,999 --> 01:31:56,667
What?

966
01:32:08,902 --> 01:32:13,344
Ain't no hawk!
Ain't nothing but bats!

967
01:32:15,442 --> 01:32:18,591
Stick to the plan boys!
Aim for his head!

968
01:32:30,153 --> 01:32:34,026
It only takes one bullet.
- You ain't got the nerve!

969
01:32:35,027 --> 01:32:37,087
Try me.

970
01:32:41,084 --> 01:32:45,164
Oh, Mr. Rango... aren't you
forgetting something?

971
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:53,455
Hand me your gun, sheriff.

972
01:32:54,306 --> 01:32:57,388
Now, Mr. Rango!

973
01:33:07,733 --> 01:33:10,320
Beans, hold on!
Don't worry! I've got a plan!

974
01:33:11,036 --> 01:33:14,961
Help!
Open the door!

975
01:33:15,745 --> 01:33:17,534
OK, plan B.

976
01:33:18,196 --> 01:33:20,261
What? Beans,
you're mumbling!

977
01:33:20,876 --> 01:33:24,295
All my problems are taken
care of. Except for one.

978
01:33:24,749 --> 01:33:28,103
It's a new West, Jake, there is
no room for gunslingers any more

979
01:33:28,556 --> 01:33:32,018
We're businessmen now.
- We got new hats.

980
01:33:32,499 --> 01:33:35,846
Where I come from, we call
this im-provi-sation.

981
01:33:36,485 --> 01:33:38,864
You're came back!

982
01:33:46,297 --> 01:33:47,810
What was that!?

983
01:33:48,138 --> 01:33:52,459
No need to panic! But I think you just
swallowed our plan B. - What?

984
01:33:53,018 --> 01:33:54,714
OK... panic time.

985
01:33:55,204 --> 01:33:58,850
You and the sheriff are more alike
than you think. Nothing but legends.

986
01:33:59,230 --> 01:34:03,833
Pretty soon no one will believe
you've even existed.

987
01:34:05,698 --> 01:34:08,607
One last bullet to kill the
last outlaw.

988
01:34:09,918 --> 01:34:12,740
How fitting!

989
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:48,831
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together,
we can reach mutually beneficial

990
01:34:49,226 --> 01:34:54,625
solution to our current situation.
- You better take it up with him.

991
01:35:04,057 --> 01:35:06,665
One bullet...

992
01:35:07,062 --> 01:35:09,557
I tip my hat to you.

993
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:13,858
As one legend to another.

994
01:35:14,219 --> 01:35:16,478
What was that you say?

995
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:22,073
Pretty soon no one will believe
you've even existed?

996
01:35:35,047 --> 01:35:41,061
Rango! You brought the
water back. Just like you promised.

997
01:35:41,427 --> 01:35:44,561
You really are a hero...

998
01:35:45,023 --> 01:35:50,123
Well, thing about heros is you never...
- Don't spoil...

999
01:35:50,786 --> 01:35:54,007
Well I don't know about you,
but I could sure go for a dip!

1000
01:35:57,181 --> 01:36:00,699
<i>And so the lizard completes
his journey.</i>

1001
01:36:01,146 --> 01:36:04,208
<i>From the humble beginnings to the
legend we sing of today.</i>

1002
01:36:04,648 --> 01:36:08,581
<i>And although, he's certain to die.
Perhaps from ...er... household accident!</i>

1003
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,528
<i>Which account for 65 % all
unatural deaths.</i>

1004
01:36:11,894 --> 01:36:15,311
<i>The people of the village will
always remember</i>

1005
01:36:15,621 --> 01:36:18,354
<i>the name of the ONE
who saved them.</i>

1006
01:36:18,652 --> 01:36:24,688
<b><i>Rango!</b></i>
