1
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,400
Let us finish it.

2
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,300
- Perhaps it is a trap.
- It is.

3
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,600
Then what do we do?

4
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,700
We break through.

5
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,300
There!

6
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,600
I see him.

7
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,500
Pagans!

8
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,600
- Forward still.
- Retreat!

9
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,500
No! Do not stop.

10
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,700
We are her salvation, and through
her command we shall live forever.

11
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,700
I will not die.
Not here, not now!

12
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,400
Never!

13
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,300
No!

14
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,200
We're almost there.

15
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,900
You'll make it.
I won't let you die.

16
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,000
You're strong enough.

17
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,000
Finish it.

18
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,300
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.

19
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,400
I just need to take a little.

20
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,900
Finish it.

21
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,400
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

22
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

23
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,800
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

24
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,700
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

25
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,300
I'm sorry.

26
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
I am.

27
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,400
I'll see you tonight.

28
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,100
Finish it.

29
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
Please, leave me alone.

30
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,800
I don't know how it ends.

31
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,000
All right.

32
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,600
I trust you.

33
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Take me.

34
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,300
Show me.

35
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,200
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

36
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

37
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,200
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

38
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,400
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

39
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,400
I'm sorry.

40
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,800
I am.

41
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,300
I'll see you tonight, OK?

42
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,400
Izzi.

43
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,200
Hey! Dr. Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

44
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

45
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,200
Dammit.

46
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,000
Come on.

47
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,900
- Did he say if it was working?
- Just said to grab you and meet in Surgery.

48
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,700
- Where is he?
- I'm not sure.

49
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,900
- Call him.
- OK.

50
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,400
Antonio sent me ahead with the scans.
He's still busy in Chem Lab.

51
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,000
Breeny, it's Manny.
Where's Antonio?

52
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,900
- It's still growing aggressively.
- That much in two days!

53
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What do you mean, you don't know?
Go get him. Find him.

54
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,900
He's been lying open 50 minutes now.

55
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,700
- He's crossing the street.
- The results?

56
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,700
- I didn't ask.
- Meet him at the elevator. Get his ass in here.

57
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,800
Micromanipulators at 42 degrees,
mediolateral, 72.

58
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,700
Yup.

59
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,900
How we doing, Donovan?
You hanging in?

60
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,100
No good.
Great specificity, but no suppression.

61
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,500
- Shall we close?
- No, euthanize.

62
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,800
- Why?
- If we don't treat now, the growth gets him.

63
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Dammit!

64
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,900
- I'll prepare the pentabarbital.
- No, wait.

65
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,900
- What is it?
- That compound we played with last year.

66
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,700
- Which one?
- From that tree from Central America.

67
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,400
- That one.
- <i>"Natul tortuosa.</i> 82-A46."

68
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,100
- From Guatemala.
- The old-growth tree.

69
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,800
We had two samples, but it was sterile.
The graftings and clippings didn't take either.

70
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,300
- That's it.
- What's happening?

71
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,700
Mix it with your compound.
They've got a similar structure.

72
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,800
- Manny, find those samples.
- I don't see it.

73
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,100
Picture them side by side.
Fold them into each other like two lovers,

74
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,600
woman on top.

75
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,900
They have complementary domains.

76
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,500
- If we can get them to stick...
- Is this it?

77
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,800
- Go!
- We have no toxicity reports, not a single...

78
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,100
It doesn't matter. Donovan's on the table.
If we do nothing, he dies.

79
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,400
- Antonio, how long?
- Two hours.

80
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,700
Keep him under.

81
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,200
- I've never seen that adhesion pattern.
- What's it binding to it?

82
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't know. But it's definitely
attaching to the high-growth regions.

83
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Let's do it.

84
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,500
.751, 1.25.

85
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,000
- Syringe is loaded.
- Give it.

86
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,100
Manny, give me light.

87
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Lowering.

88
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,900
- Injecting.
- Injection at 23:57.

89
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,100
- 23:57.
- Good boy, Donovan. Good boy.

90
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,500
- What's up?
- My ring.

91
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,100
- What ring?
- My wedding ring.

92
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,200
- Where'd you leave it?
- Right there, where I always put it.

93
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,400
- Someone must've knocked it on the ground.
- Tommy, may I have a word with you?

94
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,900
- One second.
- What are you doing?

95
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
- It's my ring. I put it there.
- It's gotta be here.

96
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,200
- I need to talk to you.
- Don't worry about it. We'll find it.

97
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Tommy...

98
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,300
- I'm concerned.
- What?

99
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,600
I saw Betty in the hall. She was hysterical.
You've been running sloppy surgeries.

100
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,300
- Nonsense!
- You injected an untested compound.

101
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,800
He was open.
We were about to put him down.

102
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,500
NIH could shut us down.
I should shut you down for it.

103
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,400
You're reckless
and you're losing perspective.

104
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,700
Look, why don't you just
take a few days at home.

105
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,600
Spend a little time with Izzi.

106
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,100
I'm here for her.

107
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Izzi.

108
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,300
Izzi?

109
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,100
Iz?

110
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,300
Izzi?

111
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
Izzi.

112
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,300
Izzi!

113
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,600
Izzi!

114
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,600
- Tommy?
- Isabel!

115
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,400
That's funny.
Very funny.

116
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,400
What are you doing?

117
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm... I'm stargazing.
I found it in the attic.

118
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,100
- Come on in. It's freezing.
- I want you to see something. Come on.

119
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,900
You're an old fart.

120
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,900
OK.

121
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,600
OK.

122
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,100
Go on. Look.

123
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,700
- You see it?
- The gold star?

124
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,400
It's actually a nebula wrapped around
a dying star. That's what makes it look gold.

125
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,500
What?

126
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,900
- I took science.
- When?

127
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,900
Junior high.

128
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,600
- The Mayans called it Xibalba.
- Xibalba?

129
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,400
It was their underworld.
The place the dead souls go to be reborn.

130
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
What? What are you talking about?

131
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,100
My book.

132
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,300
- I'm writing about it.
- I thought it took place in Spain.

133
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,500
It begins there.

134
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,800
Ends there.

135
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,100
Are you done?

136
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,600
- Almost.
- Good. When do I read it?

137
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,900
Someday soon it will explode, die,
and give birth to new stars.

138
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,200
How amazing that the Mayans chose
a dying star to represent their underworld.

139
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,500
Of all the healthy points of light in the sky,

140
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,200
how did they find one that was dying?

141
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,100
Where are your shoes?

142
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,000
Izzi! Come on, come on.
Let's warm you up.

143
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,900
Whoa, whoa. Careful.

144
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
OK. I'll get it.

145
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Careful. Iz?

146
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,300
Stop. No!

147
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,300
Get inside.

148
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
Serves you right.

149
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,400
Is she a redhead?

150
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
What?

151
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,200
I left it in Surgery.

152
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,300
If you can't wait, you can't wait.

153
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,700
I'm joking.

154
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,600
- I'll make some coffee.
- Wait. The sponge.

155
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
I want you to heat it.

156
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,500
Outside, before,
you couldn't feel the cold.

157
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,300
Tommy.

158
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,200
- I'm calling Dr. Lipper.
- No! I'm afraid.

159
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,000
Jesus, I'm sorry.

160
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,500
- It's been happening for a while.
- What?

161
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,900
- I'm losing sensitivity to hot and cold.
- Why didn't you tell me?

162
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,100
Because I feel different inside.

163
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,700
I feel different.

164
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,100
Every moment.

165
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,300
Each one.

166
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,000
Tommy?

167
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,700
Oh, Jesus.

168
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,400
Look, don't worry.
Don't worry. All right? I'm here.

169
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
I will always be here.

170
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,900
I know. Yes, I know, Iz.

171
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Got you.

172
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,000
- Hello?
- Alan? Tommy.

173
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,100
- Tommy.
- What's the earliest you can make tomorrow?

174
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,900
- Let me check my schedule.
- It's time for you to read it.

175
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:16,500
- Three? I'm in Surgery till then. Is it urgent?
- No, no. That's fine. Thanks, Alan. Bye.

176
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,100
- We're going to see him tomorrow.
- Start it. Tell me what you think.

177
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,000
- But it's not done.
- Not quite.

178
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,300
Don't answer it.

179
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,700
- Hello? Antonio, what's wrong?
- Can you get down here?

180
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,500
- What is it?
- Donovan.

181
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,500
- Is he OK?
- He's perfectly fine.

182
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,900
- What's happening?
- You won't believe me.

183
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,500
You've got to see for yourself.
Come right away.

184
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,600
No, I can't now. I can't.

185
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,400
- To Donovan!
- What's going on?

186
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,000
- Show him.
- I came to check up on Donovan.

187
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,400
- Where is Donovan?
- That's him.

188
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,400
What? It can't be.

189
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,300
He's almost healed.
There's hair growth.

190
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,200
- I didn't believe it either.
- Antonio had me run some tests.

191
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,400
Donovan responded well.
Really well.

192
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,500
I pulled up videos of him pre-op.
He's testing twice as well.

193
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,100
We're seeing an increase in neural activity
in all areas usually stunted by ageing.

194
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,100
- And the tumor?
- No change.

195
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,800
The growth patterns are normal.
There's no positive or negative effect.

196
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,900
- We should tell Dr. Guzetti right away.
- No! No.

197
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,800
Antonio,

198
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,600
prep a new cocktail.
Stick with the same substance.

199
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
What?

200
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,000
- We're moving forward.
- Wait.

201
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,300
But this could be a medical first.

202
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,800
A revelation! We've gotta pursue it
and duplicate the findings.

203
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,700
We can monitor synaptic growth,
but our focus is tumors, not ageing.

204
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,900
- I know, but...
- I want the next subject ready for surgery.

205
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,800
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

206
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,300
Everything's all right.

207
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,100
Inquisitor?

208
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,100
Enter.

209
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,000
The heretics.

210
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,300
They have confessed
and ceded their lands to your holy office.

211
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,900
They await yourjudgment.

212
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,300
Yet another slice of her nation is mine.

213
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,200
Soon she will be powerless against me.

214
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,000
Queen of nothing but her sins.

215
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,100
What will you do with her?

216
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,700
She too will confess,
and then

217
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,900
she too will die.

218
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,700
Captain. 'Tis the queen.

219
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,000
She is surrounded.

220
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,700
The inquisitor demands blood.

221
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,100
Then there is no more time.

222
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,900
What is our response?

223
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,800
Go now.
Warn the queen.

224
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,300
- And you? Where are you going?
- He must be cut out.

225
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,000
- She has forbidden it.
- There is no other choice.

226
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,200
This is our only hope.

227
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,200
Stay. Stay.

228
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Our bodies are prisons for our souls.

229
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:20,100
Our skin and blood,
the iron bars of confinement.

230
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,400
But fear not.

231
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,600
All flesh decays.

232
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,800
Death turns all to ash,

233
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,500
and, thus,

234
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,300
death frees every soul.

235
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,900
You, the condemned,

236
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,800
you have confessed.

237
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,600
You admit to protecting a queen

238
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,900
who twists the word of God

239
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,500
and drowns all Spain in sin.

240
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,100
Your queen seeks immortality on Earth -
a false paradise.

241
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,000
This is heresy.

242
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,500
She leads you towards vanity,

243
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,500
away from the spirit.

244
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,100
But this is foolishness,

245
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,600
for death exists.

246
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,100
The Day of Judgment is irrefutable.

247
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,500
All life must be judged.

248
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
- Why are you here?
- Come quickly.

249
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,600
- Leave. Protect the queen.
- She sent me. She demands your return.

250
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,600
- Not before he dies.
- No, Tomas. Leave him.

251
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,500
She desires a private audience.

252
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:01,200
But fear not.
She will not be in hell alone.

253
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,700
I will make sure
her servants are waiting for her.

254
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,700
Faithful servant, why do you cry?

255
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,300
To see Spain brought so low,

256
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,300
with an enemy thriving within her borders,
feasting on her strength.

257
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,100
The shame is too much.
I've failed her.

258
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,500
Dare not pity Spain.

259
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,500
These times are dark,

260
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:25,000
but every shadow, no matter how deep,
is threatened by morning light.

261
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,200
Of course.

262
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,600
This loyalty of yours

263
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,300
inspires you to protect Spain at any cost,

264
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,800
but killing the inquisitor is suicide.

265
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,400
Europe would have my head.

266
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,700
I, for one, am not ready to die yet.
Are you?

267
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,400
I will die for Spain.

268
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,000
I know, Conquistador.

269
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,600
I know.

270
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,700
And this bravery of yours,
it may save us yet.

271
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,300
For Spain has a plan.

272
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,500
There is hope.

273
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,200
- There's hope?
- Father.

274
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,700
I am Father Avila
of her royal Franciscan order.

275
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,400
Our allegiance remains with Spain.

276
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,400
Father.

277
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,200
Guards, leave us.

278
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,300
Conquistador,

279
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,400
I am going to tell you the true reason
why the inquisitor pits cross against crown.

280
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,900
One year ago, Father Avila returned
from the jungles of New Spain

281
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
with a secret so great,

282
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,600
it promised to free
all mankind from tyranny.

283
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,600
Spain desired this treasure
above all things,

284
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,100
but the inquisitor feared it
with equal measure.

285
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,800
When I refused to give up my quest for it,

286
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,000
he responded with this violent coup
to bring Spain to her knees.

287
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,700
But we have not yielded,

288
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,700
and now we will defeat him.

289
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,200
This is our hope.

290
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,200
- A dagger?
- Used in religious rituals.

291
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,100
I took it from a dead Mayan priest.

292
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,200
The marking on the hilt...

293
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,100
Do you see it?

294
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,100
It is a map.

295
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,300
A map to the Mayans' greatest secret.

296
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,700
Greater than Chichen Itzá, greater than
Yaxchilán, greater even than Tikal.

297
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,800
Here, in the centre, in the core
of the once-great Mayan civilization,

298
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,300
we will find a lost pyramid.

299
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,700
No.

300
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,600
Not lost.

301
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:33,200
Hidden.
The hidden pyramid of the Mayan myths.

302
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,800
The myths tell us of a holy pyramid,

303
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,700
built upon the navel of the Earth,

304
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,700
the birthplace of life.

305
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,400
A special tree sprouts there.

306
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,900
They say whoever drinks of its sap

307
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,900
will live forever.

308
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,600
Eternal life?

309
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,300
Spain hangs at the whims of a merciless
enemy and you taunt us with yarns?

310
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,000
They are not yarns.

311
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,400
Remember,

312
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,900
our own Bible confirms it.

313
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,900
In Genesis, there are two trees
in the Garden of Eden -

314
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,700
the Tree of Knowledge
and the Tree of Life.

315
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,100
When Adam and Eve disobeyed the Lord
and ate from the Tree of Knowledge,

316
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,100
the Lord banned them from the garden
and hid the Tree of Life.

317
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
Could it be?

318
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,800
Could it be?

319
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,800
Kneel, Conquistador.

320
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,000
Let in the morning light.

321
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,700
The beast runs amok in my kingdom.

322
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,600
He has isolated me,

323
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,700
and now he is sharpening his talons
for one more fateful push.

324
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,800
But salvation lies
in the jungles of New Spain.

325
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,800
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

326
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,800
Upon my honor and my life.

327
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,100
Then you shall take this ring
to remind you of your promise.

328
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,400
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

329
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,000
and when you return,

330
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,200
I shall be your Eve.

331
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,400
Together, we will live forever.

332
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,800
Iz?

333
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,500
Izzi?

334
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,900
- There you are.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

335
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,700
- Babe, we have Lipper at three.
- This is an actual Mayan book.

336
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,200
Look. It explains their creation myth. You see,
that's First Father. He's the very first human.

337
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,500
Is he dead?

338
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,300
He sacrificed himself to make the world.

339
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,900
- The Tree of Life's bursting out of his belly.
- Come on.

340
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,800
Listen. His body became the tree's roots.
They spread and formed the Earth.

341
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,800
His soul became the branches,
rising up, forming the sky.

342
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,400
All that remained
was First Father's head.

343
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,400
His children hung it in the heavens,
creating Xibalba.

344
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,900
Xibalba? The star.

345
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,100
Nebula.

346
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,700
- So what do you think?
- About?

347
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,700
That idea.

348
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,800
Death as an act of creation.

349
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,800
Stay together, guys.

350
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,500
I'll pull out the car
and meet you in front.

351
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,300
Iz. Iz!

352
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,700
- Tommy.
- Hey.

353
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,200
Tommy.

354
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,500
You're all right.

355
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,800
- I'm close.
- No.

356
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,600
There are options.

357
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,600
- We'll have to make some choices.
- Alan?

358
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:02,700
You had a minor seizure. The growth in
your brainstem's back and it's growing faster.

359
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,100
- The next time...
- No!

360
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,700
No.

361
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,900
We had a breakthrough.

362
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,800
I know I can translate it to help you.

363
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,100
I just need a little more time, OK?

364
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,700
There's hope.
There's real hope.

365
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,000
- Tommy.
- What? What, baby?

366
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,300
- I wasn't afraid.
- I know.

367
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,100
You're very strong.

368
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,000
No.

369
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,200
- No.
- What?

370
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,600
When I fell

371
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,100
I was full.

372
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,400
Held.

373
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,400
I know.
I caught you. I held you.

374
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:05,200
It's OK, Iz.
Everything's gonna be all right.

375
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,600
There's time.
We have time.

376
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,500
We need to examine
the hippocampal region.

377
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,600
- What the hell's going on?
- I brought in Dean Katari and Dr...

378
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,600
I'm sorry, what are you doing here?

379
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,500
- Antonio and Betty were just showing me...
- Donovan's synaptic growth increased.

380
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,000
His brain is identical to scans
from 12 years ago, when he was six.

381
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,800
And the tumor?

382
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,600
- Exactly. Please?
- Tommy...

383
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,100
Please!

384
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,200
Perhaps you should wait for me in my office.
Manny. I'll be right there.

385
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,900
- Thomas, I'd like a word with you in private.
- After surgery.

386
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,200
First cut.

387
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,100
Tommy.
Dr. Lipperjust called.

388
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:52,100
He said Izzi's doing better and they're gonna
move her to a regular floor in the morning.

389
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,200
When we're done here,
I want you to prep Cain.

390
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,200
I'll get her.
She'll take care of it.

391
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,900
What do you think you're doing?

392
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,400
You don't abandon results like that.
You repeat the procedure, get a confirmation.

393
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:51,100
Confirmation that the tumor's unaffected?
She'll be dead by then.

394
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,100
Tommy.

395
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,500
She had a seizure.

396
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,200
I'm so sorry.

397
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,400
- How's she doing?
- She's stable.

398
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,800
Who's with her?

399
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,800
- She's alone?
- She needs to rest.

400
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,900
No one invents new drugs overnight. No one!
You're not being rational.

401
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,900
- You can't fix everything!
- Don't tell me what I can do.

402
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,100
- Your wife needs you. Why are you here?
- Why the fuck do you think I'm here?

403
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,700
Shit.

404
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,400
I'll leave you two alone.

405
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,900
Lilly, I'm sorry about before.

406
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,100
She's amazing.

407
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,900
Lillian,

408
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,500
could...

409
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,600
could you have Henry
re-scan the animals for me?

410
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,800
- OK.
- Thanks.

411
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

412
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,900
I brought your manuscript
in case you want to work.

413
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,400
How are you feeling?

414
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,200
Good.

415
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,400
I'm sorry.

416
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,600
What about?

417
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,700
There's been progress at work.

418
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,000
My conquistador.
Always conquering.

419
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:04,500
- No. Something amazing. We tested...
- That's for you.

420
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,200
It's for me? What is it?

421
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,300
Open it.

422
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,300
Pen and ink. For writing.

423
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,900
It's all done except the last chapter.

424
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,900
I want you to help me.

425
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,100
How?

426
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,400
Finish it.

427
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,100
Finish it.

428
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,700
- I don't know how it ends.
- You do.

429
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,100
You will.

430
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,100
Stop.

431
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,200
- Remember Moses Morales?
- Who?

432
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,100
- The Mayan guide I told you about.
- From your trip?

433
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:27,500
The last night I was with him,
he told me about his father who had died.

434
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,600
- But Moses wouldn't believe it.
- Izzi!

435
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,300
No, no. Listen. Listen.

436
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,000
He said if they dug his father's body up,

437
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,300
he would be gone.

438
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,700
They'd planted a seed over his grave.

439
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,800
The seed became a tree.

440
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,700
Moses said his father became part of that tree.

441
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:57,200
He grew into the wood, into the bloom.

442
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,400
And when a sparrow ate the tree's fruit,

443
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,000
his father flew with the birds.

444
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,700
He said

445
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,000
death was his father's road to awe.

446
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,600
That's what he called it.

447
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,800
The road to awe.

448
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,200
Now,

449
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:32,700
I've been trying to write the last chapter and
I haven't been able to get that out of my head.

450
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,300
Why are you telling me this?

451
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,700
I'm not afraid anymore, Tommy.

452
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,200
I asked Lilly if I could be buried at her farm.

453
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,600
No, stop it!

454
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,200
- I want you to be with me.
- I am with you. Look.

455
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,800
I'll always be with you.

456
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,000
I promise.

457
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Will you stay with me tonight?

458
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,200
Yeah. I'll stay.

459
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I'll stay.

460
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,600
Don't worry,

461
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
we're almost there.

462
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,400
Through that last dark cloud is a dying star.

463
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,200
And soon enough, Xibalba will die.

464
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,200
And when it explodes,
you will be reborn.

465
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,500
You will bloom.

466
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,900
And I will live.

467
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,100
Don't worry.
We're almost there.

468
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,400
Thank you, Lord! We are here!

469
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,300
Circles.

470
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,700
He leads us in circles.

471
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,000
Only we are left.
All of your countrymen are dead.

472
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:44,800
He killed them all with this blind quest.

473
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,000
It's time. Time to stop him.

474
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,300
Captain, we are lost.

475
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:19,300
The Franciscan and his tales are false.

476
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,600
There is no hope for us here.

477
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,300
There's only death.

478
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,700
- I've mapped us a course back to the ships.
- Coward.

479
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,400
Damn the maps!

480
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,800
We're close and I will find it.

481
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,900
Captain! Captain! Captain!

482
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,700
Father. What is it, Franciscan?

483
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,700
In the jungle...

484
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,200
The marking on the hilt.

485
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:56,300
- On the dagger?
- It is the same. The same as on the stone.

486
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:21,400
Your choice - die now
or, by my side, fight and live.

487
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:37,000
- You fool.
- Captain!

488
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,200
Father.

489
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,500
Take it.

490
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,300
We are here.

491
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,800
- Where?
- The temple is there.

492
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,600
Sorry, Father.

493
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,400
For you, there is only death.

494
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,600
But our destiny is life.

495
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:31,400
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

496
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:36,000
and when you return,
I shall be your Eve.

497
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,400
Iz! Iz!

498
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,500
Come on, come on, come on!

499
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,000
Oh, no. Please! Please!

500
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,000
- Step aside.
- She's in V-fib. Pulse thready.

501
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,200
- I'm bagging. Sir! Sir!
- Izzi! Izzi!

502
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:09,200
- Get the family out. Get him out!
- Sir, please!

503
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,600
- Pads.
- Charging.

504
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:11,900
- Pulse?
- Thready.

505
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,100
Pressure?

506
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,400
Oh, God.

507
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,400
Tommy.

508
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,400
I know. I know.

509
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,300
I've never seen anything like it.

510
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,700
- Antonio didn't reach you?
- What?

511
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,200
It's Donovan.
The growth is shrinking.

512
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,700
It's like the disease is cured.

513
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,600
Izzi.

514
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,600
Izzi!

515
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,000
Izzi!

516
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,200
- No, no, no, no!
- Sir. Please, sir.

517
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,500
Sir!

518
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,500
Sir, it's too late.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

519
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,400
- Sir, it's too late.
- You killed my wife!

520
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,300
- Get off him! Let go!
- Let go!

521
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,100
No.

522
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,100
No.

523
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,400
No!

524
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

525
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,600
Don't die! Don't die!
Don't die! Don't die!

526
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,600
No! No!

527
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,700
No!

528
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:51,400
It seems to me that we struggle
all our lives to become whole.

529
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,900
Complete enough when we die

530
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:01,300
to achieve a measure of grace.

531
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,200
Few of us ever do.

532
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,800
Most of us end up going out
the way we came in, kicking and screaming.

533
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:23,000
But somehow Izzi, young as she was,

534
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,300
she achieved that grace.

535
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,500
In her last days she became whole.

536
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,400
She saw her...

537
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,300
Tommy!

538
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,500
- Tommy...
- Just stop it!

539
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:52,600
Death is a disease.
It's like any other.

540
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,500
And there's a cure.

541
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,000
A cure.

542
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,500
And I will find it.

543
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,100
No!

544
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,100
All these years.

545
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,100
All these memories.

546
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,900
There's been you.

547
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:11,700
You...

548
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,100
You pulled me through time.

549
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,800
Dr. Creo?

550
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,100
Dr. Creo, we heard you were back.

551
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:53,600
Update me on everything we know
about that tree. Every detail.

552
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,700
I'm OK. Everything's fine.

553
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:13,000
The Donovan breakthrough's
our starting point. It's a starting point.

554
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,300
Right, let's build on it.

555
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,900
Stop ageing, stop dying.

556
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:20,100
Stop dying, that's our goal.

557
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:23,900
Scans. Cultures. Charts.
Let's get to work.

558
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,600
Come on, let's get to work.

559
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,500
Xibalba.

560
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,500
We're here.

561
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,300
We almost made it.

562
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,300
I'm sorry.

563
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,700
I'm sorry.

564
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,400
Finish it.

565
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,500
Stop it. Stop it!

566
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,700
What do you want?

567
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,200
Leave me! Leave me alone!

568
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,300
Please, please. I'm afraid.

569
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,600
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

570
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,500
I don't know.

571
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,000
I'm trying. I don't know how.

572
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,100
You do.

573
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,300
You will.

574
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,800
You do.

575
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,400
You will.

576
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:37,000
I'm not afraid anymore, Tommy.

577
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,800
I'm gonna die.

578
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,000
I'm going to die.

579
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:54,200
Together we will live forever.

580
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,800
Forever.

581
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,000
Forever.

582
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,200
Forever.

583
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,300
We will live forever.

584
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,000
Finish it.

585
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,600
OK.

586
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,800
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

587
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,800
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow. We always...

588
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,300
They're waiting on me.

589
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,400
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

590
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,700
I'm sorry. I am.

591
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,200
I'll see you tonight, OK?

592
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,500
Izzi.

593
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,500
Hey! Dr. Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

594
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:24,400
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

595
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,400
Come on. Let's go.

596
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,800
Dr. Creo, where are you going?

597
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,300
Izzi!

598
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,500
Izzi.

599
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,200
No!

600
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,200
Finish it.

601
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,400
Behold.

602
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,800
My queen.

603
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,900
Now and forever.

604
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,700
We shall be together.

605
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,300
Bye, Iz.

606
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,800
I finished it.

607
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,300
Is everything all right?

608
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,500
Yes.

609
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,600
Everything's all right.

610
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:38,200
