1
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,200
Ladies and gentlemen!

2
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,600
Please welcome the man who knows
what you're gonna do before you do it!

3
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,800
The amazing,
Frank Cadillac!

4
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,300
This is for the world peace.

5
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,700
Good evening. Welcome to the
beautiful downtown Las Vegas.

6
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,800
How many people are here
from the orient? Raise your hands.

7
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
You, sir...
Where are you from?

8
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,100
No, wait, wait...
Don't tell me.

9
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sensing,
you must have soul.

10
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,300
You're a soul man.

11
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,300
Why don't you share with
everyone where are you from?

12
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,100
- Korea.
- How about that, folks?

13
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,100
May I assume
this charming young lady...

14
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
...is your daughter?
- She is my wife!

15
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,300
Well, of course she is!

16
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,200
What happens in
Vegas stays in Vegas.

17
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,400
- What's your name?
- Yhun-Kihong.

18
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,900
Yhun-Kihong.

19
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,600
Would you be kind enough to join
me up on the stage please?

20
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,900
Are you serious about this guy?
This is a joke?

21
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,300
Going behind some mimes
and clowns while we're in it?

22
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,700
Yhun-Kihong.

23
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,100
What if I told you that
that pretty necklace your wearing...

24
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,800
...has a broken catch and on my count
of three, will fall in your drink.

25
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,200
Wouldn't that be something?
Wouldn't that just blow your mind?

26
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,200
- Yeah.
- Yes. Wouldn't it blow all your minds!

27
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,900
Three, two, one...

28
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
...now.

29
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,100
Somebody said "spooky"?

30
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,100
Wait a minute, look at your glass.
Where did it go?

31
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,800
Yhun-Kihong, why don't you
look inside my pocket?

32
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,500
Reach in. Dig deep.

33
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Let's have a big hand
for Yhun-Kihong.

34
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Well... that's magic folks.
And that's why I'm here.

35
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,500
They probably seen
a lot of those shows.

36
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,600
Mentalists,
magicians, illusionists...

37
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,600
It would be shocked to know
that sometimes...

38
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,300
...not often, but sometimes,
it's the real deal.

39
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,100
Masquerading as an act...

40
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,700
...hiding behind
a few 50 dollar tricks...

41
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,300
...hiding in a plain sight.

42
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,300
Because if the magician
doesn't do that,...

43
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
...the alternative is impossible
for others to live with.

44
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,400
Anyway. Wednesday nights
The Back Page doesn't pay very well.

45
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,600
So I gamble.

46
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,900
But I don't play against other people,
only against the house.

47
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,700
So, no mega Jack Pots,
no wash outs.

48
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,800
The idea is to be unnoticed.

49
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,200
That way I can keep coming back.

50
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,200
I'm not a God.

51
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,700
I can't see everyone's future,
only my own.

52
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,300
And only within 2 minutes,...

53
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,500
...except for when I saw her.

54
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,400
But we'll come back to that.

55
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,000
There is no pattern to this guy,
he is all over the map.

56
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,500
He's not counting,
not enough the top of that deck.

57
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Wait a minute.

58
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,100
Isn't it that "Two Bit Magic Act"
that called Back Page.

59
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,300
- What's his name?
- Cadillac.

60
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,900
Yes, Frank Cadillac.

61
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,100
Is he pulling tricks on us?
Is that legal?

62
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,600
He can't trick the deck.

63
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm telling you. That little prick
knows what's coming.

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,800
If he's really knocking a system
why's he not betting more.

65
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,800
That's gonna be my second question.

66
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,500
Look at that.
He is looking at us.

67
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,800
It's like he can hear us.

68
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,200
- What table was that?
- 27.

69
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,200
It's Roybal, send security to table 27!
Coming right now!

70
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
<i>Your bets please.</i>

71
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,900
Here is the thing
about the future.

72
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,000
Every time you look at it,...

73
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,100
...it changes.

74
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,500
Because you looked at it,...

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,400
...and that changes
everything else.

76
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,700
Nine thousand and seventeen.

77
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,600
Empty the drawer.
Move!

78
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,600
Drop the gun, now!

79
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Nine thousand and seventeen.

80
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,500
Drop the gun, step back.

81
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,500
Its his gun.
He's gonna shoot you people.

82
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Step back,
we'll decide this right now.

83
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,900
<i>What's he doing?</i>

84
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,800
Security the doors, elevators, escalators
every way out of this damn place, now!

85
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,100
<i>Clayman! Seal off the Black Jack tables!
Sullivan, linkup with Roybal!</i>

86
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,500
- We are on the floor! On the floor!
- Bring the view of the cameras!

87
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
That way! This way!

88
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,600
He's right next to
the ten dollars slots. Aisle 14.

89
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,300
<i>There he is! Behind you!
Your left. Turn around!</i>

90
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,700
He's right between you.

91
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,300
He's in the mensroom!
Near the Gameshot! Gameshot!

92
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,900
Davis, where the hell is he?

93
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Black t-shirt, straw hat,
heading towards the entrance.

94
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,800
Come on, let's go.

95
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Call Vegas PD.

96
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,500
<i>He just stole a silver Charger,
tag 585-G4S.</i>

97
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,800
<i>- Drop the gun, step back!
- It's his gun.</i>

98
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,900
He was in the top of gambling bureaux's
wish list about 2 months ago.

99
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,900
And what he does
has nothing to do with luck.

100
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,700
It's a definite ability. Look at him!
He knows exactly what to do not get caught.

101
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,500
Can you explain that to me?

102
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,100
No, I can't explain it, Kelly,
nor do I have the time.

103
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,400
The Russian Federation has a 10 kiloton
nuclear munition, unaccounted for...

104
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
- I understand that.
- I'm not sure you do.

105
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,900
We need every agent available
beating the street.

106
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,100
That bomb was stolen
5 weeks ago.

107
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
We have just been informed of it now.

108
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,500
Which means it could be parked
under this truck for all we know.

109
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,100
I need actionable intelligence.

110
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,600
Not paranormals
and bullshit magicians.

111
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,000
With all due respect sir,
this bullshit magician...

112
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,300
...achieved paranormal advanced awareness,
it's statistically impossible.

113
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,700
You let me bring him in,
and you get what you want.

114
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,400
5 days, Kelly.
That's it.

115
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,200
Get me the head of casino security.

116
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,800
- You ROYbal?
- It's RoyBAL.

117
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,800
- Whatever.
- Who are you?

118
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,700
Cavanaugh, take a walk.

119
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,300
Hey, Roybal. This isn't
a pissing contest. Come on.

120
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,600
What did you do?
You bought a new car?

121
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,600
- Stole it.
- Oh, look it is.

122
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,100
20 minutes to walk 20 steps.

123
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, that's what you get
from two packs a day.

124
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,800
I got you two sandwiches.

125
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,800
Two sandwiches?
That's plenty grand.

126
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,700
Come on, take it. I love you.

127
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,900
Oh, Jesus.
How can I repay you?

128
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,700
Must be a big
to drive this thing.

129
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,200
Chief Roybal,
Special Agent Ferris.

130
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,900
I'm sure Agent Cavanaugh
has explained to you...

131
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,700
...everything you say is has been
concealed. You only admit...

132
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,200
...it can be used against you.
Do we understand each other?

133
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,400
Sure.

134
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,900
- Tell me about Cris Johnson.
- I don't know who that is.

135
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,700
How about Frank Cadillac?
You chased him in the casino tonight.

136
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,600
- He stole a car from valet parking.
- Yes, yes I know Cadillac.

137
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,300
I thought he was cheating us at cards,
the next thing I know...

138
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,900
...he's tackling some guy waving a gun.
- The gun wasn't his.

139
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,700
The man he tackled was
one of the two casino killings in Reno.

140
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,200
He is in custody now.

141
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,400
Come on, I'll show you something.

142
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
You remember this?

143
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,800
Oh, yeah, of course I do.

144
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,300
We were saying that
he was looking right at us.

145
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,400
- How did you get this?
- Now think carefully.

146
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,800
What were you talking about
when he looked up?

147
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,300
We were saying if he has a system
why wasn't he betting more.

148
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,000
You sure you weren't doing
or saying anything else?

149
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,700
Just going down and pick him up...

150
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,600
And right then? That's when
he looked up? Very specific.

151
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,500
That's what I said.
He looked up. Really.

152
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,300
So he doesn't have to be there to do it.
Once you entered his consciousness,...

153
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
...he can pick it up.

154
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,400
Is that to work the system?

155
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,500
Thank you.
We're finished.

156
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Done some good here, Mr Roybal.

157
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,200
None of these up for the discussion.
As far as your concerned...

158
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,900
...Chris Johnson never existed.

159
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,300
That's going to be difficult, considering
a hundred cameras saw him at the casino.

160
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,300
Don't worry.
The tapes have been destroyed.

161
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,700
Hey! Is she single?

162
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,800
Chris, you can keep stealin' cars
and have been chasin'...

163
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,400
...but that's not a life.

164
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,400
And you gotta forget this girl
that you keep seeing in your head.

165
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
No, I am not going anywhere
until I meet her.

166
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,500
What supposed
she doesn't show up?

167
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,400
She already did.
At the diner.

168
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,800
10 min. after 8.

169
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,900
You've got a couple of hours.
How about a game of pool?

170
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,900
Allright, Irv.
We'll shoot some pool.

171
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,100
We timed every hand
in the Black Jack.

172
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,400
The longest was 89 seconds
and Jonhson pulled 6 cards 21.

173
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,500
So we know he can stay
at least a minute and a half ahead.

174
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,200
I had a text from a radio
frequency spectrum analysis.

175
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
He came up dry.

176
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,700
He is not receiving
any form of electronic help.

177
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,000
At one point there was a
2 minutes and 16 seconds delay.

178
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
He never backed.
Just got up and walked away.

179
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,900
Maybe 2.16 is too long
and he can't see that far.

180
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,400
Narrows the window
a little bit any way.

181
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
We got him.

182
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,700
Vegas PD got a lo-jack hit
on the stolen vehicle.

183
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,900
Listen.
About that girl.

184
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,500
When you looked at the clock,
did you happen to see a calendar?

185
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,800
Because...

186
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,800
...its could be 10 years
from now she gets hungry.

187
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,400
It's gotta be soon.

188
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,300
I never seen further ahead
than two minutes.

189
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,000
Except for her.

190
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,500
And what do you think
the reason is for that?

191
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,500
I don't know.
Maybe she doesn't scare easy.

192
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,800
Maybe she is the one.

193
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,800
Well, when you get like this...

194
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,600
...there is no talking to you.

195
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,900
- She is almost here.
- What happened to the diner?

196
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,400
Somebody else. A cop.

197
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,400
A cop?
Well, then you gotta go.

198
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,500
Wait, I wanna see how much she knows,
what she wants from me.

199
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,900
Chris Johnson.
Still here huh?

200
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,400
Where else would I be?

201
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,500
Special Agent Ferris.
Next time steal a car without lojack.

202
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,200
Can we speak privately?

203
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,300
It's ok, Irv, go ahead.
Thanks.

204
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,200
I'm sure you know why I'm here.

205
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,400
Cause you're the man who knows
what I'm going to do before I do it. Right?

206
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,000
The show, right. Right.
I saw you there.

207
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,900
- Wonderful. Do you like magic tricks?
- Yeah, yeah I do. Like your...

208
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,400
...magic tricks, clairvoyance,
whatever you callin' it.

209
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,500
Let's talk something hard.

210
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,400
A stolen nucleur munition has being smuggled
into the U.S. and may -in fact- already be here.

211
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,500
I want you to look ahead and tell me
where it is gonna be deployed.

212
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,800
I think you got the wrong guy.
It's a magic act.

213
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,100
You gonna stick with that story.

214
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,100
Because millions of lives are at risk and
you could maybe prevent a major catastrophe.

215
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,100
On a practical note. We are standing
in front of a stolen vehicle...

216
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,100
...and you are wanted for assault
involving a weapon at the casino.

217
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,200
That was an accident. He had a gun
and he was going to shoot two people...

218
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,100
Yeah?

219
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,300
How did you know that?

220
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,900
The deed goes unpunished, does it?

221
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,800
I can fix your legal problems
but first you gotta step up...

222
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,100
...otherwise your next magic show
is gonna be in Fulsom State Prison.

223
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,700
It's ironic but...

224
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,500
...people like you who try to help
had been torturing me.

225
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,200
In the full sense of the word
since I was 3 years old.

226
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,400
What do they call it?

227
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,600
Oh, yeah.
Observed play therapy.

228
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,400
Featuring a marathon 36 hours...

229
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,700
..."can you guess
the next flash card" game?

230
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,000
So, please,
leave me alone...

231
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,800
...and let me live
some semblence of a normal life.

232
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,500
I would love to indulge
your feelings. But I'm dealing...

233
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
...with a slightly larger picture
right now.

234
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Now you can exercise your responsibility
to help your fellow men...

235
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,700
...or I will exercise that
responsibility for you.

236
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,800
You're right, I gotta go.

237
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,600
He's gone, right?

238
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,600
I missed him by seconds tonight.

239
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,400
Excuse me honey,
can you get off my car?

240
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah. Thank you. Jesus.

241
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,700
- Sr. ROYbal?
- It's RoyBAL. Can I help you man?

242
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,400
I have a few questions
if this is a good time?

243
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,500
Gaming Commission is after hours,
you guys should be in a strip club, come on.

244
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,100
What can you tell us
about Chris Johnson?

245
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,300
I don't know
who your talking about.

246
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,600
Let me rephrase the question.

247
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,600
- Here you go, honey.
- Thanks.

248
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,100
Excuse me.
Hello!

249
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,200
I noticed you're alone too.
Do you mind if I join you?

250
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,800
Actually I do.

251
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,900
Sorry to bother you but I have
a question about the coffee,...

252
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,600
...the bean they use...

253
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,700
Isn't that something you should
probably ask your waitress?

254
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,900
Yes, it is.

255
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,900
Excuse me, do you have a light?

256
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,200
I don't smoke.

257
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
- Here you go, honey.
- Thanks.

258
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Please. Don't.

259
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,200
- Hi, Liz.
- Did you follow me here Kendal?

260
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,000
No, no. I just thought
we could talk.

261
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,400
You know we got
really nothing to talk about.

262
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
And I told you that
3 weeks ago.

263
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,100
Liz, come on. I had an off day,
just give me another shot.

264
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,700
It's not gonna happen, OK?
So maybe you should just go.

265
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,100
Do you know how hard
it was to find you?

266
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,700
I was at your apartment,...

267
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,300
...I tried the Starbox in Lexington,
I was at the dry cleaner...

268
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,900
All I'm asking for is a few minutes
of your time, so we can work things out!

269
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,100
Ok, Jesus!
You're stalking me now.

270
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,400
Don't! Don't say that, please.
That's a terrible thing to say...

271
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,300
Let go of me, Kendal.

272
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Look, I just... I thought we can talk.
You know, maybe we can take a drive...

273
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,900
...and now your ruining it.

274
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,300
Your hurting me.

275
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Kendal?
I think your having another off day.

276
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,200
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her future.

277
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,600
Really?

278
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,200
Hi, my name is Chris.

279
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,900
You okay, Kendal?

280
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,600
The thing is I feel connected to you
and I don't know the reason why.

281
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,200
Now listen.

282
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,500
I think it's only fair that
you pay for the lady's breakfast.

283
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,300
What are you having?
Pecan pies are amazing.

284
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,600
Excuse me.
I can pay for my own breakfast.

285
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,000
And you know what?
You two, work things out.

286
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,500
Your hurting me.

287
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,100
Kendal?
I think your having another off day.

288
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her future.

289
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,800
Really?

290
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,000
<i>Incoming.</i>

291
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,000
- God damn it, Kendal!
- What? Don't point at me. This is your fault.

292
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,400
Get out of here!
Will somebody please call the cops?

293
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm so sorry.
Are you OK?

294
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,200
Let me help you.

295
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,100
Come on, lets get you
cleaned up.

296
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Come on.

297
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
OK.

298
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,200
- I'm seeing some stars.
- Yeah?

299
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,300
I am Liz.

300
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,500
Chris.

301
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,000
You must have a death wish
getting involved in that.

302
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,500
- Here. Just...
- OK.

303
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,300
OK. Hold it there.

304
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,000
- Feel a bit.
- OK.

305
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,200
- It well.
- What well?

306
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,800
Your luck.
It's gonna change.

307
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,200
What are you?
A leprechaun?

308
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Do leprachaun's get punched in the face
or have their car stolen?

309
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,800
- Your car was stolen?
- Yeah.

310
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
I'm hoping they find it today.

311
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,200
Supposed to be in Flagstaff.

312
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,800
Hey, is this tooth loose here?

313
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
I don't know.
I don't think so.

314
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,700
It hurts.

315
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,100
Listen, maybe I can give you a ride.

316
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,600
- I'm gonna go that way.
- That would really be helpful, Liz.

317
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,900
Thank you.

318
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,800
- I do have to make a stop though.
- It's OK.

319
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,100
And it may take a few hours,
so cool with that?

320
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:36,000
Hey, look.  If you're uncomfortable
with this all, I'll take a bus.

321
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,800
No, no, no. Its fine, its fine.
You're not a psycho.

322
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,400
Right?

323
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Because the first psycho vibrate
you're out of the car.

324
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
- OK. Yes Ma'am.
- OK.

325
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,200
Deal.

326
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,000
Deal.

327
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,200
It's amazing. Wasn't it?

328
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,100
I end up in a diner where you are
and both heading in the same direction.

329
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,800
I don't know if I can call
that amazing, but...

330
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,200
Destiny.

331
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,100
That's what it really is.

332
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,900
OK. I'm starting to get
that psycho voice.

333
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,500
Ah, no...
You don't believe in destiny?

334
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,000
Well, even if it does exist,
I don't think I want to know.

335
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,500
I mean if every move we make
is pre-ordained and...

336
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,300
...what is the point of that
life is supposed to be a surprise?

337
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Isn't it?

338
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,200
It would be nice.

339
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
Yeah.

340
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,800
So he came in twice a day
for a week at exactly 9 past 8?

341
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,400
Yeah, he would stay a few minutes,
have a martini and then he'd go.

342
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,000
Until today
when he met that lady.

343
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,100
Did you find anything strange
about that?

344
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,600
Not strange enough
to call the police.

345
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,700
We got a regular who counts
the cornflakes in his bowel...

346
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,900
...it has to be an even number.

347
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,800
- Got any cameras?
- Inside? No.

348
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,300
Outside?

349
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
No.

350
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,700
Noticed what kind of car
he was driving...

351
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,400
...maybe overhear
where they were going?

352
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,600
I don't know what car but
they were heading up Flagstaff.

353
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,500
- Flagstaff?
- That's what they said.

354
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,200
Got another regular. She's always on a diet.
Brings in a scale to weigh the salad dressing.

355
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

356
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,800
Guy knows we are after him,
he still risks coming here.

357
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
8 or 9. Twice a day.

358
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,400
He didn't know if it's day or night,
just the time. He was waiting for her.

359
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,100
Allright. There is a traffic cam
over there, the bank,...

360
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,700
...7-11 across the street.
Run all the tapes. We will get lucky...

361
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,200
...and catch them at the wide.

362
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,900
Hey, remember Roybal,
the casino chief?

363
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,700
He had his throat cut last night
after getting a knee cap shot off.

364
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,500
You're telling me this now?
We just talked him about Johnson.

365
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,200
- Hey, I just found out.
- Allright.

366
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,000
- Local weapon?
- Dead end.

367
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,000
Forensic's came up emtpy.
Not a hair or a fibre.

368
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,900
Somebody wants information.
Now, next time anything happens...

369
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,900
...relevant to Johnson,
I want to know right away.

370
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,500
- I don't care if it's a paper cut.
- OK, boss.

371
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,800
The head of casino security.
What did you learn from him?

372
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,200
For a macho guy,
he screams like a girl.

373
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,900
He was questioned by federal agents,
looking for Chris Jonhson. Yes?

374
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,300
He said
they hadn't found him yet.

375
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,000
Do you believe this shit?

376
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,100
He can see things
before they happen?

377
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,000
It makes no difference
what I believe.

378
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,000
Look, we spent two years
setting this up.

379
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,800
And that man out there is worried
all this will be comprimised by Johnson.

380
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,700
We're wasting our time
looking for some magician.

381
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,400
We are being paid to secure
the operations, Jones...

382
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
...not to hunt down some
carnival barmy.

383
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Really?

384
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,200
Then why are the same authorities that
are looking for us so interested in him?

385
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,900
Get rid of him.

386
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
Do it now.

387
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Hi.

388
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,700
We have a super reservation.
I teach here once a week.

389
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,800
The conditions are pretty lousy.

390
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,400
But it's in the Canyon.
One of the eight wonders of the world.

391
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,100
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Liz.

392
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,600
A couple hundred years ago
this tribe was booming.

393
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
Plenty of food and thriving culture.

394
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,100
They should be better off
but I guess this is just their destiny.

395
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,500
I would like to meet there shaman.

396
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,100
I read once that in the many
North American tribes...

397
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,400
...their shamans purpose
wasn't only healing.

398
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,000
But they also claim
their power of the atmosphere.

399
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,300
To bring on or stop rain...

400
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,600
...even though future advance.

401
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,500
Do you think that's possible?

402
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,000
I believe any thing is possible.

403
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,700
Me too.

404
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,900
- Whose birthday?
- One of my students.

405
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,400
Hi.

406
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,200
How is it going?

407
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,300
Hello, how this everybody?
Good?

408
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,200
That's good.

409
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,200
That, that was a lot good.
But you messed up on the last part.

410
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
On the last part, yeah.

411
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,100
I thought you weren't coming back
til next monday.

412
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,700
Well I'm not, but it's Jake's birthday.
How could I miss that?

413
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,400
Who is that man you're with?

414
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,600
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No, no, he's not my boyfriend.

415
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,200
He's just my friend.

416
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,200
I think he likes you.

417
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,200
Why did you say that?

418
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,400
Because he looks at you like
my brother looks at his girlfriend.

419
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,900
Hey, Jake.
Do you want to see some magic?

420
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,600
I'll show you something.
Come here.

421
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,300
I found this rock out
in the Canyon.

422
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,000
And I want you to hold it
because it's a magic rock. That's right.

423
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,900
Hold it really tight,
keep squeezing.

424
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,400
It's magic.

425
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,500
It won't bite.
Happy birthday.

426
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,300
So you're a magician?

427
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,000
Well.

428
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,500
I have a small magic act
back in Vegas.

429
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,900
Frank Cadillac show.

430
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,200
- I thought your name was Chris.
- It is.

431
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,700
Frank Cadillac is my stage name.

432
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,300
How did you come up with that?

433
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,200
I picked two things I really like
and I put them together.

434
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,300
Frankenstein and Cadillacs.

435
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,100
Your odd.

436
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,000
Charming.

437
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,000
But odd.

438
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,300
<i>Cease fire!
Get out of the range!</i>

439
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,000
Nice.

440
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,900
A little closed, huh?

441
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,600
OK.

442
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,200
You were right about
the traffic cam.

443
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,700
We got a positive ID.

444
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,600
I'm sorry.

445
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,300
Don't be sorry.
It's OK.

446
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,500
- Did I drop?
- Drop?

447
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,400
- Yeah.
- Ah, no.

448
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,500
- God! It's coming down so hard.
- Yeah.

449
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
I like rain.

450
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
I like rain too.

451
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,200
Do you know once,
I think was in Denmark,...

452
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
...it rained fish.

453
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,700
Because the sun
dehydrated the water.

454
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,100
Took it out in the atmosphere.

455
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,800
Rehydrated the fish eggs,
and they hatched...

456
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
...and rained fish.

457
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Is it truth?

458
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,600
Yes, in the clouds. True story.
Happened 50 years ago.

459
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,800
Just felt like sharing
that way to you.

460
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,500
The road washed out ahead.
You can't cross until morning.

461
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,000
Not even if it rains like this.

462
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Spin around and go back about
two miles, take your second left...

463
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,100
...there will be a motel they called...
- Cliffhanger. Thanks.

464
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,600
Right.

465
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Him right?

466
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
That's it.

467
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
There is no front plate,
where is the other side?

468
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,400
I don't have it.

469
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,600
What was that at the front window?
Go back. Back, back.

470
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Back, there!
Zoom in.

471
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,300
It's a permit.

472
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,800
Track it and find her.

473
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
I'll light a fire.

474
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,700
Chris, one little problem.

475
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,000
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm gonna sleep in the car.

476
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,200
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

477
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,600
Sure.

478
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,700
Hey, did you hear the joke about
the zen master who ordered a hot dog?

479
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
No.

480
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,400
He said he would have
one with everything.

481
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,700
Good night.

482
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,700
Good night.

483
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,800
What we have?

484
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,600
They're in the Cliffhanger Motel
outside Flagstaff.

485
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,600
We found an Arizona foreman
who remembers the land cruiser.

486
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,000
How did they do that?

487
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,400
The road was floaded and he was
about to suggest a place to stay.

488
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,800
- But Johnson already knew, right?
- Exactly.

489
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,900
Callie, it just got worse.

490
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,100
All right people,
we got a nuclear alert. Code red.

491
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,700
In the southern California region.
L.A. to San Diego, 95% certainly.

492
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,400
Nuclear emergency search teams
are on the way, but until they get here...

493
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,700
...somebody please tell me what
my agency, the FBI are doing about it?

494
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,300
Well, sir, two main suspects
have been interrogated.

495
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,400
Cars and primacies
have been checked.

496
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,800
We have opened up surveillance on 2 or 3
suspects but nothing actionable yet.

497
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,600
All was that we are doing?
Waiting for something actionable?

498
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,100
There are 8 million lives
that are precaurious at best...

499
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,000
...so I say we widen this net
to slightly suspicious...

500
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,300
...and get some decent Intel before
this nuke blows up Los Angeles.

501
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,800
Allright, Callie.
What do you propose we do next?

502
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
I believe that
the urgency of the situation...

503
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,700
...compels the use of any and
all resources to obtain Chris Johnson.

504
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,300
We know where he is.
Let my team pick him up.

505
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,300
<i>The FBI are mobilizing.
Continue watching.</i>

506
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,700
<i>- Did you have the image?
- Yes.</i>

507
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,700
He said they're mobilising.

508
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,800
Standard procedure
when security is escalated.

509
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,200
Tell him to wrap it up.
They'll lead us straight to Johnson.

510
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,600
<i>- Don't lose sight of them. Understand?
- OK, certainly.</i>

511
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
You hungry? There is
a coffee shop down the road.

512
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,700
I'd rather eat here,
if that's OK.

513
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Sure.

514
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,400
What?

515
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,800
There is an Italian painter
named Carlatti.

516
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And...

517
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,200
...he...

518
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,900
...defined beauty.

519
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,200
He said it was
a summation of the parts...

520
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,200
...working together
in such a way that...

521
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,900
...that nothing needed
to be added.

522
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,300
Taken away or altered.

523
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,900
That's you.

524
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,400
You're beautiful.

525
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,700
That was incredible.

526
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,200
What was?

527
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,400
This.

528
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,000
Over here. This is a good stand,
our position had a good view of the motel.

529
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,800
We'll put our removable area surveillance,
this formation, over here and that turn off.

530
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,900
A team with a parabolic step
right here.

531
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,300
That's fine, but I also want
mobile surveillance,...

532
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,400
...get me 2 or 3 hummers.
If they run on us, I wanna be flexible.

533
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,800
Ferris.

534
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Call the local police in Flagstaff.
Tell them patrol the outside perimeter.

535
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,800
I want that area locked down.

536
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,400
A body turned up at an apartment,
in line of sight of my office...

537
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,300
A slit throat, like Roybal.

538
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,300
Somebody trying
to follow us to Johnson.

539
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,900
Chris?

540
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,200
Yeah?

541
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,500
Maybe there is
such a thing as destiny.

542
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,900
Give her 40 seconds.

543
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,100
So after two minutes, he just
stop seeing what's gonna happen?

544
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,400
Not sure, I hope so.

545
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,100
- Elizabeth Cooper?
- Yeah.

546
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,800
Federal Agent Ferris.

547
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,000
- What is this about?
- I'm gonna need a few minutes of your time.

548
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,300
Yeah, OK.

549
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,700
They are putting her in the car.

550
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:39,700
<i>- Silahýný býrak, geri çekil.
- It's his gun. He's gonna shoot you people.</i>

551
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,700
This was 3 days ago?

552
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,200
He used you to get away
from Las Vegas.

553
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,300
You can be pretty sure,
everything he told you...

554
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,700
...is a lie. He's delusional.
A sociopath.

555
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,300
Oh, my God.

556
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,100
My God.

557
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

558
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,500
Go back to the motel. Have a drink.
Put one of these in his glass.

559
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,100
It'll take 5 minutes to put him to sleep,
then we will come in and get him.

560
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,600
Nobody is being hurt.

561
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,000
But this is important, you need
to do it at least 2 minutes...

562
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,800
...after you get him out of the room.

563
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,200
Why do you need me?
Why can't you just get him?

564
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,900
Liz, as I understand that you work
for a federal founding program...

565
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,100
...teaching on a native reservation,
is that true?

566
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,800
Yes, that's true.

567
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,100
Well, I think you're here to help us.
We are on the same team.

568
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,400
Now they letting her go.

569
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,800
- Thanks for the note.
- Sure.

570
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,600
- Get a nice walk?
- I did. You know, it's really beautiful here.

571
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,100
Ah! I'm...
I have a present for you.

572
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,500
Ah, thanks.
I need that.

573
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,800
Yeah.

574
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,300
Is something wrong?

575
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,800
Oh, no, no. I'm fine.
Now, why don't you go wash up...

576
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,800
...I'm gonna make us breakfast.
- OK.

577
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,400
45 seconds.

578
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,100
1 minute 30.

579
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,500
And that's 2.

580
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,300
- Looks good.
- You think so?

581
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,600
Thank you.

582
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,500
Don't drink that!
It's drugged.

583
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,400
Oh, God, I don't know what I'm doing!
I don't know what I'm doing.

584
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,100
Some federal agent came up to me and
said that you are a delusional sociopath.

585
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,500
And they showed me this tape.

586
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,700
So maybe you are
but I don't want to believe that.

587
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,300
I don't think I can believe that.

588
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,700
They also said that if you run
they will shoot you.

589
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,100
So I should drug you instead.

590
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,800
Even if what they said is true,
I don't want you to die.

591
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,400
I don't want you to die.

592
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,100
Chris, is it true?

593
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Oh, shit!

594
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,900
Give me broadband noise reduction,
I don't like to hearing this.

595
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,900
Speak quietly and act normally.

596
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,500
How long they have said
this drugs will take?

597
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,300
About 5 minutes.

598
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,900
- What is he doing?
- He's drinking. Give it a minute.

599
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,900
Got a clean shot?

600
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,500
Not yet.

601
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
The man that in the casino
would have killed two people.

602
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,100
It happened,
it just hadn't happen yet.

603
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,100
Oh, my God,
you're delusional.

604
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,000
Fluffy cranberry or a stack of
chocolate pancakes for the kids.

605
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,200
<i>Fluffy Cranberry or a stack of chocolate
cheap pancakes for the kids in a...</i>

606
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,900
Safe?
Who knows what's safe?

607
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,100
I know a man dropped dead
from looking at his wife.

608
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,900
<i>Safe?
Who knows what's safe?</i>

609
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,300
<i>I know a man dropped dead
from looking at his wife.</i>

610
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,300
You can't get lost in the woods,
if you never go in to the woods.

611
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,000
<i>You can't get lost in the woods,
if you never go in to the woods.</i>

612
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,400
<i>Boy, you got
an answer for everything.</i>

613
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,800
That's right sir. You'rr the only person
authorised to do so.

614
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,100
<i>That's right sir. You're the only person
authorised to do so.</i>

615
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,600
- How are you doing this?
- I have no idea how...

616
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,100
...but I can.
I was born with it.

617
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,000
- This is some kind of a trick?
- You know we don't have time for that.

618
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,700
You said anything is possible.

619
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,500
So, you see things
before they happen.

620
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,500
- You see the future?
- My future,...

621
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,200
...when it affect me
and only 2 minutes ahead.

622
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,000
Excepting you.
For some reason I saw you.

623
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,400
For some reason I saw you. Far beyond
anything I've ever seen before...

624
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,900
...and I don't know why.

625
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,100
What do you mean,
you saw me?

626
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,700
You have been...
You have been doing that to me?

627
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,100
You know what I'm gonna do
and what I'm gonna say...

628
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,900
...that your just setting me up?
- No, I haven't.

629
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,900
I wanted to find you because
I need to know why I was seeing you.

630
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,300
Because I...

631
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,400
It was not a setup.

632
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,300
What are they want from you?

633
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,500
They think I can help them
in matters of a national security.

634
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,100
I don't understand if
you can help them why don't you?

635
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,800
Because I can't.

636
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,300
I can only give them
2 minutes ahead start...

637
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,400
...and that's if my life
has personally involved.

638
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,000
- But with me you can see further.
- Yeah.

639
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,200
But they don't know that.

640
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,600
There is almost 10.000 dollars
in this envelope.

641
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,900
They know about you.
You need to get away from here.

642
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,700
What time do you have?

643
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,500
- 9 to 10.
- Set your wacth 9 to 17.

644
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,300
Read this when I left,
and wait exactly...

645
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,300
...45 seconds before
you do what it says.

646
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,900
I will take Ferris with me.

647
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,500
I might be away a week or month...

648
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,400
...but if you can wait,
I'll find you.

649
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,500
Something's wrong.

650
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,700
- Don't do it.
- I already have.

651
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,400
Go, get him!
Alive!

652
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,600
Lets go!

653
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,400
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

654
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,500
Chris.

655
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,500
Oh, shit! Run!

656
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,200
Johnson!

657
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,700
You're not gonna shoot.

658
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,900
You gonna let me die?

659
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,300
Hey, I need some help!
Get him out of here.

660
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,900
Let's get him out of here.

661
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,300
I got you.

662
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:33,300
You allright? You OK?
Open your eyes. Look at me.

663
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,700
No good deed
goes unpunished, does it?

664
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,000
- She got him.
- Now what?

665
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:50,300
- Did you see her?

666
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,100
Smoke?

667
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,100
Thanks for today.

668
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,700
You didn't left me to die.
I appreciate.

669
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,800
That was a really showed character.

670
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,800
I know, I seem like a bad guy,...

671
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,100
...and all of this but in the interest
to preserving our freedom...

672
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,300
...there are larger issues at play.

673
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,500
- What about my freedom?
- With freedom comes responsibility.

674
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,300
- I have rights.
- This isn't about you.

675
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,300
This is about 8 million other people.

676
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,000
If I do what you want,
you will keep me in this chair forever.

677
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,000
There is a nuclear bomb
somewhere in Los Angeles.

678
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,800
And every television station
in the world will broadcast...

679
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:31,300
...precise details of it's detonation. So go on,
push that two minutes as far as you can...

680
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,600
...and find it.

681
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,100
<i>...broadcast this afternoon for a
breaking news downtown in Los Angeles.</i>

682
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:28,000
<i>...the largest technology corporations
opposed this idea. And tech lobyying blame for...</i>

683
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,000
<i>...and members of the LAPD bombsquad
are staging in that area.</i>

684
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,300
<i>We gonna live now, our reporter
Lisa Joiner, at the scene with very latest.</i>

685
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:41,400
<i>- Lisa? - Jeff, this all began when police
received an anonymous phone call...</i>

686
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,200
<i>...saying that explosives would be
detonated at this parking garage...</i>

687
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,000
<i>...at Second and Broadway
at 6 o'clock tonight.</i>

688
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,000
<i>There is no, um...
They have no idea of the motive.</i>

689
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,800
<i>- The victim however...
- Oh, Liz, I'm sorry.</i>

690
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,500
What?

691
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,100
What did you say?

692
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,000
<i>We saw the LAPD surrounded the area.
They've secured a perimeter.</i>

693
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,000
<i>But now the bomb squad
is making there way onto...</i>

694
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,100
<i>...the deck of this building.</i>

695
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,400
<i>And there the men are walking up
with black suit on the sight.</i>

696
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,900
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

697
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,400
<i>There... There has been an explosion.
There has been an explosion.</i>

698
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,500
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

699
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,500
<i>The victim has been identified
as Elizabeth Cooper of Las Vegas.</i>

700
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,400
<i>And she was strapped
to a wheel chair.</i>

701
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,300
<i>Sorry.</i>

702
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,700
<i>...tax of %10 U.S. workers
receives that options.</i>

703
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,900
<i>Many technology companies will be...</i>

704
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,500
- Tell me what just happened?
- I, I can't.

705
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,500
It won't work like this.

706
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,800
Just get me out of this room
and I will do what you want.

707
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,300
I'm begging you.
Please, get me out of this room.

708
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:18,800
Let him out.

709
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,700
- Cally! Cally, wait up.
- What?

710
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,300
The residue report of Betty Peterson.

711
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,200
The dead girl in the apartment.
Her throat was cut bleed out,..

712
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,800
...otherwise, nothing to the DNA,
the place immaculate again.

713
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,600
- How did it go with Johnson?
- Something happened...

714
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,300
...but he's not sharing.
There are traces of potassium iodine.

715
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,200
Some medication
Peterson was taking.

716
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,300
- They found an empty pill box.
- No. the only reason to take it is...

717
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,100
...to prevent radiation poisining.

718
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,400
Hey, wait, wait. Can I get a smoke
or something? I need to relax.

719
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,800
Thanks.

720
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,300
Hey, can I get a light?

721
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,600
Look.

722
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:30,100
<i>Bay 01. Bay 01.
I got a visual.</i>

723
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,300
<i>Target is heading the south route
in the Seen street.</i>

724
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,800
<i>Subject is turning east
onto Broadway.</i>

725
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,200
Stay here.
Let me deal with this.

726
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,500
Why are you here?

727
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,800
They killed her.

728
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,900
Two hours from now.

729
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,700
They killed Liz.

730
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,100
Tell me what you saw.

731
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,600
I saw them execute her.

732
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,800
Right there.
On the roof.

733
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,400
It hasn't happened yet
and I know who has her.

734
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,000
The same people we are after.
There is a reason that...

735
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,100
...they brought you here.
They are using Liz as bait.

736
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,100
10 to 1, you go out on that roof,
they are gonna put a bullet in your brain.

737
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,600
I know.

738
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:43,500
Right now, she is still alive.
She is, you are, we all are.

739
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,600
Lets try to keep it that way.

740
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,800
I help you,
you help me, alright?

741
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:55,000
I want a two mile radius.
Every telephone grid, short waves,...

742
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:00,000
...satellite tower, shut it down.
- What do you want me to do?

743
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,700
Let him shoot you.

744
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,100
<i>You called an unpickable style.
Turn number and dial again.</i>

745
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,400
<i>You called an unpickable style.</i>

746
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,800
FBI! Get on your knees!

747
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,700
You OK?
That looked pretty close.

748
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,800
Slide of hand.

749
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,900
- You didn't get him?
- Not alive. He fired on the chopper.

750
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,000
But doesn't matter,
he couldn't call in the hit.

751
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,900
As far as they are concerned,
you're not here yet.

752
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,000
Buys us time.

753
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,200
Everyway I tried,
she still ends up dead.

754
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,800
What if you do it earlier? I think, they'll
have to bring her here in a vehicle, right?

755
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,700
- Looking for a license plate.
- Right.

756
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,500
Can you see it?

757
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,300
It helps if you
don't speak right now.

758
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:50,100
California plate number:
50KF272.

759
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,200
California tag: 50KF272.

760
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,800
Please, where are you taking me?

761
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,600
<i>- OK. Not a problem. </i>

762
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,900
What do you want with me?

763
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,800
<i>Be careful.</i>

764
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,300
Who the hell are you people?

765
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,400
You set them up Cavanaugh?

766
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:35,300
Local SWAT has been deployed and
the regional team is here to show back us up.

767
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:38,000
Allright, listen up.
The van, carrying Elizabeth Cooper,...

768
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:41,900
...will exit the warehouse, crossed over here,
18 compounds, approximately 5 minutes.

769
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,600
4 minutes and 27 seconds.
Do you mind?

770
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,500
- Not anymore. Go ahead.
- They've got a wrap of explosives...

771
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,500
...wired to a cell phone.
- Remote trigger.

772
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,500
When the cell phone has setted off
they'll use one of speed dial.

773
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,500
They will take this road
to the entrance gate.

774
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,900
At that point, Alpha and Bravo
will swarm to the entrance...

775
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
If you can just be quiet
and do exactly what I say...

776
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,100
...I will save your life.

777
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,500
We needed to stop the vehicle here
before it gets into the gates.

778
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,900
Alpha and Bravo will hold
and contain here,...

779
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,400
...sniper teams will initiate on
Johnson's call. On his call. Are we clear?

780
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,400
Our elements
shoot to kill any hostiles.

781
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,500
- What about the intel?
- We don't need them. We have him.

782
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,200
Allright everybody!
Lets go.

783
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,300
Go! Lets go! Move!

784
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:14,900
Back up! Back up! Back up!

785
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,900
Go, go, go!

786
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,500
- Stop the van.
- Not yet. You'll kill her.

787
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,400
Now!

788
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,700
We gotta go! Now! Now!

789
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,700
Pull back! Pull back!

790
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,500
They've got a gun on the crane,
northeast corner.

791
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,600
Negative, no visual.

792
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,300
Give me that.

793
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,100
The opened door way,
eight inches above the guard rail.

794
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,700
Allright, lets go!

795
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,200
The girl escaped.

796
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,600
<i>David, Charlie,
heading the entry point!</i>

797
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,600
Turn right.

798
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,000
Clear.

799
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

800
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,200
Come on, lets go!

801
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,500
<i>Round up!
They're coming to round up!</i>

802
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:12,800
Stop.

803
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,500
No!

804
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,300
Go.

805
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,000
<i>This is Charlie-1,
element clear, over.</i>

806
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,500
Thanks.

807
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:52,400
There is explosives,
there, there and there.

808
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,200
Stay close.

809
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
- Sniper.
- Where?

810
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,700
- Behind us.
- Sniper at 6 o'clock. Got a visual?

811
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,800
Nobody move.
I'll find him.

812
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,200
Cat walk, second level.

813
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,900
Cat walk, 6 o'clock, second level.

814
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,200
I got him.

815
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,700
We have to clear this
deck by deck.

816
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:07,700
You check this one.
I'll do the rest.

817
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,000
Lets sweep and clear.

818
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,800
She is near the engine room.

819
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,900
Come on, man.
Release the hostage...

820
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,500
...if still wanna get out of this.
- Don't patronise me.

821
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,000
- How good are you with that gun?
- Very good.

822
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,600
- You gonna be OK, Liz.
- Back off!

823
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:27,300
I've seen
every possible ending here...

824
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,900
...none of them are good for you.
- I will take my chances.

825
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,300
One more step fortuneteller
and it definitely won't be good for you.

826
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,100
You have one way out of this.

827
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,600
That was not it.

828
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:00,800
Liz, look at me. It's OK.
Look at me. It's over.

829
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
It's over.

830
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,000
No, it's not.

831
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,200
The nucleur device was removed.
We need to find it's exact location.

832
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,000
Now, this registers any significant
detonation in the earth's crust.

833
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,400
Take a look.
Tell me what you see.

834
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,300
Something's wrong.

835
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:38,300
- I made a mistake.
- What?

836
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,400
I made a mistake.

837
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
- It's happening.
- When?

838
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:43,900
Now!

839
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,500
I've got 4 teams in the place,
we just waiting on road group.

840
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:30,700
Allright.
Ferris.

841
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,200
It's me.

842
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:37,100
I'll do it but I have conditions.

843
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,800
I want her left out of it.

844
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,900
I'm sure we can work
something out.

845
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:13,700
Liz.

846
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,500
Liz.

847
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:28,800
Come back to bed.

848
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:30,900
I gotta go.

849
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:34,700
Go where?

850
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,100
Something that I have to do.
I can't put it off any longer.

851
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,700
- Are you coming back?
- Yeah.

852
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:07,600
Maybe a week or a month.

853
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:12,400
But if you can wait
I'll find you.

854
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,000
Here is the thing
about the future.

855
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,000
Every time you look at it,
it changes.

856
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:59,900
Because you looked at it.
And that, changes everything else.

857
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:15,300
You ready?

858
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Yeah.
