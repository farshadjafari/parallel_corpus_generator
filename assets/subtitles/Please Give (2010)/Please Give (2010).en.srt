1
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:44,602
Okay, come a little closer.
Tilt your head away.

2
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:47,999
All right, hold your position.

3
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:55,643
- I can't go till the end of the month.
- Really? That's too bad.

4
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:57,604
- They might be over by then.
- I know.

5
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:00,156
New York magazine made a list
where they're the best.

6
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:01,999
I read that.

7
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:06,716
Rebecca, you gonna see the leaves?
The leaves.

8
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:10,320
Upstate? They change colour?

9
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:12,362
No.

10
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:16,721
Apologise for the smell.

11
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:21,005
We cracked some of the windows,
but it still has that odour.

12
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,156
Oh, it's fine.

13
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:25,000
My mom was always cold, so...

14
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,317
Most of the windows
were actually painted shut.

15
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:28,476
Yeah.

16
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:31,639
So this stuff, it doesn't match...

17
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:35,766
...but it's no stains, good condition.

18
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:39,966
This stuff is all upholstered.

19
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:44,598
- How old?
- It's antique. Era pieces.

20
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:45,756
It's pretty dreary.

21
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:47,758
Checking the springs,
they feel loose.

22
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:49,246
Okay.

23
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:51,398
You don't buy the little stuff, right?

24
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:55,480
Like clothes and jewellery,
knickknacks?

25
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:59,322
No, we just...
Just furniture and artwork.

26
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:02,365
- Sometimes pottery.
- It's best to just get rid of this stuff...

27
00:03:02,527 --> 00:03:05,599
...like this, all at once, right?

28
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:06,882
Yeah. Well, yeah...

29
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:10,642
I mean, it's probably junk.
I'm a busy person.

30
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:12,843
You shouldn't concern yourself
with that.

31
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,519
Yeah, I'll probably get rid
of something priceless like this...

32
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:19,918
- ... and not even know it, right?
- No, I don't think so.

33
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:23,636
- So are you gonna keep this place?
- No, no.

34
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:25,559
- I like the suburbs.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:28,605
Well, it's definitely big for the city.

36
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:32,555
- If you like the city.
- Right. Yeah.

37
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:37,403
It's a table, wood, oval...

38
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,085
- Hi.
- Hi.

39
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:56,236
It's weirdly hot today, huh?

40
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:00,042
Well, I work inside.

41
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,324
You have to go outside
to get to work...

42
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:05,206
...and then go outside to leave work.

43
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:16,526
- How's your grandmother?
- She's great. She's doing really well.

44
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,166
Good.

45
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:38,081
Why does she hate us so much?
What did we ever do to her?

46
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:40,397
She sees you, she sees death.
You're a vulture.

47
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,035
Us buying that apartment
has absolutely no downside.

48
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,880
Her grandmother gets to live there,
we're not hovering.

49
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:48,641
- You're a saint.
- Oh, God, it's just so sad.

50
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,923
- What?
- The old lady.

51
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,806
Andra, I mean.
Does she ever even go outside?

52
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:57,437
- What's so fun outside?
- The world, honey? Life?

53
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:59,837
- Maybe she's perfectly happy.
- Oh, no.

54
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,601
You just say that to rationalise
not feeling bad for her.

55
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,359
Why do I have to feel bad for her?

56
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:06,916
- She's at the end of her life.
- That's not my fault.

57
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:08,236
Oh, God.

58
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:11,956
- Hey, my zit medicine isn't working.
- You won't use what I tell you.

59
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:13,355
So I deserve it?

60
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:17,236
- I'm just trying to help you.
- Well, don't help me.

61
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:20,557
I don't know why
you don't go to Associated.

62
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:22,524
You do know.

63
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:26,396
If it was your money,
you'd walk the extra five blocks.

64
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:29,957
Yeah, well, it's 10 blocks.
And no, I wouldn't.

65
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:33,642
When my feet get better,
I'll do it myself.

66
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:39,041
Oscar-winning actor George Clooney
has it all. I mean, looks, charm...

67
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:42,961
So, Grandma, what do you wanna do
for your birthday, huh?

68
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:44,480
Mary and I will take you out.

69
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:48,276
- Mary?
- Sure. She's just been really busy.

70
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:50,318
- professional baseball team?

71
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:55,763
U seless, but fascinating,
celebrity facts.

72
00:05:55,927 --> 00:06:00,284
George was born on May 6th, 1961
in Lexington, Kentucky.

73
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,678
His father, Nick, is a TV newscaster,
his mother a-

74
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:06,122
- Hi.
- Hi.

75
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:14,525
Okay, could you please tell me
what a medallion is?

76
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:19,203
- It's, like, when you win something.
- These look like shit pellets.

77
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:21,323
- You want one?
- Sure. Thanks.

78
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,680
You should've seen
what she was wearing today.

79
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:27,998
It was this backless dress.
And man, does she have a big back.

80
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,397
Like a dude, you know?

81
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:33,206
You know, Mary, it's weird,
the way you watch her.

82
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,038
I don't watch her,
I walk by her store...

83
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:38,163
...and I can see what she's wearing.

84
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,398
What are we gonna do
for Grandma's birthday?

85
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:45,956
Oh, whatever.
When is she gonna croak already?

86
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:49,676
Come on, Mary, what if somebody
said something like that about you?

87
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:51,360
They probably already have.

88
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:53,518
I think I'm gonna buy her
a nightgown.

89
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:56,645
- How much?
- I don't know.

90
00:06:57,127 --> 00:07:00,437
- She's just got this ratty old thing.
- I'll write you a cheque.

91
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,719
Hey, you know the neighbours?

92
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:06,560
They look at me, like,
" Is she dead yet?"

93
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,558
Why shouldn't they?

94
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:11,636
- Because it's wrong.
- You think if they didn't buy...

95
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,446
...her apartment she wouldn't die?
What's the difference?

96
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:18,838
- I like this texture. Yeah.
- Yeah? It's comfortable?

97
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:20,556
- Kind of stiff.
- Really?

98
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:21,716
Yeah.

99
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:24,276
- Handsome, isn't it?
- Yeah.

100
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:25,482
- Gorgeous.
- Yeah.

101
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:27,638
We just redid the cushions...

102
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:30,799
...but we found some original fabric
on the web.

103
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,002
A whole bolt.

104
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,646
How much?

105
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,283
- Let me check.
- Okay.

106
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:40,240
What's wrong with that piece?

107
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:42,796
- Not comfortable.
- Let's take it off the floor, then.

108
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:46,677
It's surprisingly comfortable.
Have another seat. Sit in it for a bit.

109
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:49,884
- Why did you do that?
- He might think it's comfortable.

110
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:53,278
- That's not possible.
- You don't know that.

111
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:56,521
It's 12.

112
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:02,119
It's 1200 dollars.

113
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:04,243
- Wanna hold it?
- No, gonna think about it.

114
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:05,920
- Okay. Hi, hon.
- Hey.

115
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:08,760
Did you guys look at that one?
That doesn't have any arms.

116
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:10,280
Hi, honey.

117
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,203
I saw some jeans I want.

118
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,244
Really? What for?

119
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,556
They're cute.

120
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:18,877
- How much?
- Two.

121
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:21,726
- Two hundred dollars?
- That's what you spend.

122
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:22,922
I'm a grown-up.

123
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:24,998
That makes no sense.
It's what jeans cost.

124
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,920
Abby, I am not spending $200
on a pair of jeans...

125
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:32,000
...for my teenage daughter when there
are 45 homeless people on our street.

126
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,078
What does that have to do
with anything?

127
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,600
- Abby.
- Hi, honey.

128
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:38,600
- You look so pretty.
- Right.

129
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,716
- Hey, what did you do this weekend?
- My wife and I drove up to Woodstock.

130
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:45,196
- Were they gorgeous?
- Oh, incredible.

131
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,437
I mean, the kids didn't care,
but we loved it.

132
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:50,405
Rebecca, you gonna go
see the leaves?

133
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:54,003
- No. I don't think so.
- Well, you should.

134
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:57,284
They're spectacular.
And they're just about to end.

135
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:02,606
You know what, next time we go,
we'll invite you to come with us.

136
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:05,645
Okay. Thank you. Thanks.

137
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:09,163
So it says here
that you were born in New York.

138
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:11,158
Yes, in the village.

139
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:14,367
Do you think that's good,
growing up in the city?

140
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:15,642
Yeah, I do. I mean...

141
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:18,082
I saw a lot of things
I probably shouldn't have...

142
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:19,839
...but it got me to grow up fast.

143
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:24,364
And I was really independent,
which, in some ways, is good.

144
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:29,082
I think it's an awful place
to raise kids.

145
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:31,199
Yeah. Yeah.

146
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:36,125
It's filthy, crime-ridden, noisy.
And it's only getting worse.

147
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:39,006
Well, that's definitely true too.

148
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:41,199
Yeah.

149
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:45,759
You know, it's funny, you said,
you know, in your questionnaire...

150
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:47,485
...that you had brown hair.

151
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:50,360
Yeah.

152
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:53,683
It's actually more of a dark brown.

153
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,239
I think it's brown.

154
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:59,797
No, I wouldn't call it brown.
It's almost black.

155
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,276
Yeah, but it's brown.
I mean, I didn't lie.

156
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,678
It's very dark brown.

157
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:08,481
Working a lot.
We're in the middle of second season.

158
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:10,956
And, you know, just working hard
and hoping...

159
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,322
Are you attracted to her?

160
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,919
Humour me.

161
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:19,483
- She's gonna hit the wall.
- Hit the wall.

162
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:21,046
Yeah.

163
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:23,926
Not gonna look good
when she gets older.

164
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:27,205
What do you mean, like, 27?

165
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:31,044
- More like 30.
- How nice.

166
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:39,925
Howard Stern trimmed
his pubes today.

167
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:46,317
He doesn't want his penis hairs
to be longer than his penis.

168
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:52,236
Fucking Howard.

169
00:10:52,407 --> 00:10:54,682
You know, you used to read books.

170
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,202
- Well, magazines.
- Please don't wreck my fun.

171
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:01,199
Will you rub my feet, please?

172
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:05,887
Jesus. How'd this one
get all mangled?

173
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:09,355
Your one toe
is completely horizontal.

174
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:11,563
Like I don't know that.

175
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:16,921
Go the other way, buddy.
Turn around, it's not too late.

176
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:19,279
I like it.

177
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:21,719
Bullshit.

178
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:49,756
Wow, you have beautiful hair.

179
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:53,124
I let it go grey when I was 40.
Why fake it?

180
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:55,642
Some people say
it makes you look older.

181
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:57,718
You know, that's probably true.

182
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:00,401
I didn't like the idea of chemicals
on my head.

183
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:03,639
And I didn't like the colour
everybody ended up with.

184
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:07,038
- Menopausal red, I used to call it.
- Right.

185
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,004
I know what you mean.

186
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,601
That's what my grandma has.

187
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:16,279
- How old is she?
- She's going to be 91 this week.

188
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:19,720
Okay. Just a little bit of compression.

189
00:12:20,927 --> 00:12:24,715
Hold your position for me.
Try not to breathe.

190
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,046
Eugene.

191
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,000
Eugene, honey.

192
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:36,245
This is Rebecca. Rebecca,
this is my grandson. An angel.

193
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:38,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

194
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,356
- So can you see it?
- What?

195
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,643
My halo.

196
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:48,717
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

197
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:51,124
What was that?

198
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:54,996
A hundred milligrams of sodium?
You shouldn't buy that stuff.

199
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:58,485
- You should cook them separately.
- Same difference.

200
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:02,879
- No, I think it takes longer.
- This is a fascinating conversation.

201
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:06,643
- Did you-? Hey, did you lay out today?
- Booth.

202
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:11,278
Mary, that's so bad for you.
You, of all people, should know that.

203
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:13,915
I'm very careful.
It's better than natural rays.

204
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:15,725
No.

205
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:19,084
- You could use some colour.
- I don't want cancer.

206
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,283
Blush doesn't give you cancer.

207
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:23,642
- Who is it?
- It's Alex from next door.

208
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:26,879
Andra, we're just going
to the drugstore. Is there anything-?

209
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:28,799
Hi, we're just going to the drugstore.

210
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:31,845
Would you like us to get you anything
while we're there?

211
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:36,445
- Hi, Andra.
- Perfect.

212
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,679
I hope you're not going to Windsor.
They're crooks.

213
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,315
- Metro. Metro. Metro Drugs.
- We're going to Metro.

214
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,159
- Yeah.
- It's better.

215
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:45,646
You gained weight.

216
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,639
- Excuse me?
- You gained weight.

217
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:52,876
Thank you.

218
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:56,039
- What?
- Thank you!

219
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:58,482
- Be right back.
- See you.

220
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:00,961
Jesus Christ.

221
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,637
Look at what she needs.
She has to take a crap.

222
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:05,081
She's old.

223
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:08,843
All those hairs on her chin.
You know, those thick black ones?

224
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:10,725
And all up in her schnozy.

225
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:13,117
I have hairs on my chin.

226
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,006
She's gonna be 91.

227
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,886
I know. It's unbelievable.
Who would have thought?

228
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:20,925
We should have bought that apartment
from that guy downstairs.

229
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,641
- Who?
- The guy right below us.

230
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:27,197
You know, Martin somebody.
He was only 79.

231
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,722
- That asshole died?
- Yeah.

232
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,765
No, the whole two-storey thing
would have been too much money.

233
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:34,121
Here you go.

234
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:37,006
- Thank you, honey.
- You're welcome.

235
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:01,363
Alex. Alex.

236
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:03,286
What?

237
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:17,721
Right over there on the other side
of the white table, please.

238
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:22,445
A little bit over. Perfect, perfect.
Thank you.

239
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:27,605
This is gorgeous. My God.

240
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:31,284
I think she kept it in plastic for, like,
50 years.

241
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:34,564
- Nice work, killer.
- Thanks.

242
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,116
- What is that?
- I'm not sure.

243
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:41,755
Just take the top
right on the base there.

244
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:46,198
That is gorgeous.

245
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:50,118
Holy cow. Look at this.

246
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:52,960
What do we ask for that? Four?

247
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:56,038
More. Five?

248
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:58,880
Six, seven. Eight.

249
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,440
Oh, I feel so guilty.

250
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:05,362
- Who sent us this?
- We got that for Andra.

251
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:07,995
It's her birthday.
I thought we'd have her over.

252
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,725
- You're joking.
- I'm not.

253
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,560
And her miserable granddaughters,
as well.

254
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:13,716
Sounds like a gas.

255
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:16,526
I don't wanna have bad vibes
right next door to us.

256
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:17,722
I feel terrible.

257
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:21,721
Hey. You know who I heard
had some great stuff? The dead guy.

258
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:24,602
- Downstairs?
- Yeah.

259
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:27,520
- Let's go.
- So sorry to hear about your dad.

260
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,120
Well, he was sick.

261
00:16:29,287 --> 00:16:30,561
- He was old.
- Yeah.

262
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:33,116
We got the number from the super.
I hope that's okay.

263
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:35,403
- No, that's fine.
- Good.

264
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:39,323
I don't know if you're gonna
want any of these things, though.

265
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,955
I think there are definitely
some pieces we could use.

266
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,116
Yeah?

267
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:47,644
It's so old-fashioned. I didn't think
anybody wanted this stuff anymore.

268
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:50,886
Well, I guess you knew him.
You knew my Dad?

269
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:52,765
He lived in the building a long time.

270
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:56,158
- Yeah, he was a very nice man.
- Martin was lovely.

271
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:58,477
- Yeah.
- Lovely man.

272
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,443
So, what are you gonna do
with the apartment?

273
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:06,044
Oh, the neighbours bought it.
I think they wanna break through.

274
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,404
They're probably celebrating
over there.

275
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:09,761
- No.
- No.

276
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:11,076
How much did they pay?

277
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:13,599
What?

278
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,280
I'm so sorry. That was rude.

279
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:17,005
Kate. Jesus.

280
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,919
I'm very sorry. I'm-

281
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:24,366
This guy would throw away our mail
if it was put in his box by mistake.

282
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,279
Are you sure he knew who we were?

283
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:29,280
Of course he knew who we were.
He didn't give a crap.

284
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,802
Oh, my God.
That's where all my magazines went.

285
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,162
It's his fault that I watch
so much television.

286
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:37,046
Now he's dead, so you can go back
to reading magazines.

287
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:39,880
You know what, I wish
that your grandpa was still alive...

288
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:43,722
...so that you could hang out
with him like that.

289
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,241
I think that's his dad.

290
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:51,879
- That guy's- That guy's old.
- You're old.

291
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:54,607
Yeah, but I don't- I don't look-

292
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:56,962
I don't look like that.

293
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,561
- Will you wrap this up, please?
- Do I look like that?

294
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:03,036
- You got it.
- Thanks.

295
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,005
- Do we have any Pepto?
- I don't know.

296
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,442
I don't know if that place
is as good as we think.

297
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:11,280
Well, I don't think it's known
for burgers. Wait a second.

298
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:13,039
Excuse me, sir.

299
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:16,279
Are you hungry?
Would you like this?

300
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:18,798
I'm waiting for a table.

301
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,235
I'm sorry. I really am.

302
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,079
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry. Really.

303
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:28,203
- Please forgive me.
- We're very sorry.

304
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:32,275
- Are you out of your mind?
- He looked homeless.

305
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:36,042
He looked like a black man
waiting for a table.

306
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:44,683
- Hey.
- Hey.

307
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,165
- You do your grandma's laundry?
- Yep.

308
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,761
- Is it gross?
- What do you mean?

309
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,078
Like, old-lady underwear.

310
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:58,160
- I don't really look.
- Good idea.

311
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,361
So I heard you guys
are coming over later.

312
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,358
Yep.

313
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:07,607
- Cool.
- Yeah.

314
00:19:16,727 --> 00:19:18,843
Hey, ladies.

315
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,884
Gorgeous day.

316
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:23,083
Going to see the leaves.

317
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,325
See you.

318
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:30,963
The leaves.
What is with these people?

319
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:33,118
- I know.
- Who gives a shit?

320
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:35,403
- I don't.
- Really.

321
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:58,445
Can I help you?

322
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:03,084
You shouldn't charge so much
for jeans.

323
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:09,118
Here. I'll do it.

324
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:15,962
When I get my eyes fixed
I'll be able to do it myself.

325
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:19,244
Grandma, you've got nothing
to drink in this place.

326
00:20:19,407 --> 00:20:22,558
- Who's talking?
- It's Mary. She's looking for alcohol.

327
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:25,036
- This place is filthy.
- Hey, I clean it.

328
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:27,516
This has botulism.

329
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,882
Why exactly are we going there?

330
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:36,845
So they can poison Grandma
and demolish her apartment.

331
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:39,123
Then let's make it fast.

332
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,200
Here.

333
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:43,601
What's this?

334
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:46,162
It's your birthday present
from the two of us.

335
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:47,806
Go on, open it.

336
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,636
I got it.

337
00:20:49,847 --> 00:20:51,599
Now, okay. Here.

338
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:56,875
Too fancy.

339
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:00,718
Yeah, well, do you like it?
I mean, look at it. Here.

340
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,083
What am I gonna do with this?

341
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:04,885
- Sleep in it.
- Say thank you, Grandma.

342
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:07,277
- I did.
- No. Actually you didn't.

343
00:21:07,807 --> 00:21:09,399
Look, it's okay. It's just...

344
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,923
I thought
that since yours is so old that...

345
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,317
I'll save it for a special occasion.

346
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:17,443
What special occasion
might that be?

347
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:20,997
Too fancy to sleep in. That's all.

348
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,401
Come on in. Welcome.

349
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,956
- What's that smell?
- It's a little cramped in here.

350
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:27,640
Grandma. Jesus.

351
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:29,525
- I smell something burnt.
- Oh, you do?

352
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:33,236
Everyone can hear you. Sorry. She's
so rude. You should smell her place.

353
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:34,556
My place doesn't smell.

354
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,002
Piss and mould have no odour.
What was I thinking?

355
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,156
Mary.

356
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:40,795
Anyway, happy birthday, Andra.

357
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:44,039
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Do you have any bourbon?

358
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:45,481
I think we do have bourbon.

359
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:47,285
Hi. I'm Alex.

360
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,005
- I'm Mary. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

361
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:52,125
- Hi, Mary. Where'd you get that tan?
- Oh, you know.

362
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:54,847
- She lies on a tanning bed.
- I go to the Sheep's Meadow.

363
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:57,441
- She lies on a tanning bed.
- And I go to Sheep's Meadow.

364
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,440
- Looks nice either way.
- Thank you.

365
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:05,036
Abby. Take those things off, please.

366
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,086
We have company.

367
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:09,078
What are you doing in here?

368
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:11,603
I don't understand that.

369
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:14,406
I'm not going out there
with this thing on my nose.

370
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,479
- You can't see it. Come out, please.
- See it?

371
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:20,923
Mom, it's swallowing my whole face.
How can you not see it?

372
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:23,965
I tell you not to eat those French fries
and greasy foods.

373
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:27,324
- It makes no difference.
- Please come and join us, Abby.

374
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:29,557
You look fine.

375
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:32,036
Okay, I'm just-
Let me just explain it to you...

376
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:34,277
...so you understand.
You know I'm not crazy.

377
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:37,325
- If she were younger than me-
- She is younger than you.

378
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:40,285
If she were prettier than me,
I'd understand, but she's not.

379
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:42,881
She's got this tan,
totally sprayed on, I would know.

380
00:22:43,047 --> 00:22:45,436
But the worst part is her back.

381
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:49,481
- What about her back?
- It's muscular. All built-up.

382
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,842
- And she wears these skimpy tops.
- It's no good.

383
00:22:52,007 --> 00:22:53,360
- No good.
- It's a big problem.

384
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:54,846
A big back is not good.

385
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,521
Oh, come on,
enough about the poor girl's back.

386
00:22:57,687 --> 00:23:00,440
- Are you still in love with him?
- He broke up with her.

387
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:03,440
- No, that's not how it went down.
- Yes, it is.

388
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:07,115
I don't understand.
How is it that you get to see her?

389
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:09,960
Well, she works in a store
near where Mary works.

390
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,925
- And what do you do, Mary?
- I work at a spa.

391
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:14,960
It's called Skintology.

392
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,197
- I do facials.
- Oh, how nice.

393
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,437
What is it that you do, Rebecca?

394
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,326
Oh, I administer mammograms.
I'm a radiology technician.

395
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:25,877
- But you're not a doctor.
- No, I'm not a doctor.

396
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:29,085
But it's-
But you're not a doctor either.

397
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:30,282
I never said I was.

398
00:23:30,927 --> 00:23:33,600
- Is it interesting?
- Well, if you like boobs, it is.

399
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,837
Well, you pop blackheads
for a living, so...

400
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:38,475
- What's the matter with boobs?
- Nothing.

401
00:23:38,647 --> 00:23:40,399
Why are we talking like that?

402
00:23:42,807 --> 00:23:43,876
So is it interesting?

403
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,117
I like the people, you know,
the patients.

404
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:47,845
Crush on the boss.

405
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:50,039
Pardon me?

406
00:23:50,927 --> 00:23:53,077
Abby. Abby.

407
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:55,807
Honey, you have undies
on your head, sweetie.

408
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,765
She has a blemish,
which I can't even see.

409
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:00,201
Abby, please take those off.

410
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,358
Who is that? Is that funny?

411
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:05,166
You should come to the spa
and get a facial. They help.

412
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,363
- You're being rude.
- Let me see it.

413
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:10,087
Come on. You know, I've seen it all.

414
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,036
Oh, wow, that's big.

415
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:14,196
- Really?
- She's drunk.

416
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:17,518
On your nose, almost cystic.
It's horrible.

417
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:20,440
- Mary.
- No, I'd rather someone admit it.

418
00:24:20,607 --> 00:24:22,199
At least then I don't feel crazy.

419
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:25,006
I'm just telling you,
half the time, I do feel crazy.

420
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:26,885
- No one says the truth.
- They should.

421
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:29,925
If you get a sucky haircut,
people should admit it. If some...

422
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:33,557
...procedure is gonna hurt, they should
tell you. It makes it worse if they don't.

423
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:35,718
I hate it when people
don't say " bless you. "

424
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:38,037
You know what I hate?
When you're in a store...

425
00:24:38,207 --> 00:24:40,482
...and you hold the door
for the person behind you...

426
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,478
...but they don't hold the door
for the person behind them.

427
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,046
You stand there
like a doorman.

428
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:47,517
- They don't say thank you.
- No, why would they? You're not there.

429
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:50,440
Jesus, I swear sometimes
I must be invisible. You want some?

430
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:52,199
Yeah.

431
00:24:52,647 --> 00:24:54,603
What do we-? What is it? Like-

432
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:58,646
- We give him about 200 for Christmas.
- I give him nothing.

433
00:24:58,807 --> 00:25:01,275
That's why he won't fix anything
for you.

434
00:25:01,447 --> 00:25:04,245
If he fixed something for me,
I'd give him some money.

435
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:06,602
You know, they have,
like, 12 children.

436
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:08,962
Nobody told him to do that.

437
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:14,679
They're very poor. They live
in that apartment in the basement.

438
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,806
- I think his wife's in a wheelchair.
- I've never seen her in a wheelchair.

439
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:21,765
- Neither have I.
- I'm pretty sure.

440
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:25,127
So how do they make
so many children?

441
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:28,324
People can still fuck
in a wheelchair, Grandma.

442
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,236
Can't they?

443
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:33,285
- Why are you looking at me?
- I don't know.

444
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,686
He's a greaseball.

445
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:40,207
I.e. meaning, he's Puerto Rican.

446
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:43,603
- Happy birthday, Andra.
- You're too nice.

447
00:25:44,287 --> 00:25:47,597
- And this... This is for you.
- I hope you like it.

448
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:50,243
You wanna blow the candle out?

449
00:25:50,407 --> 00:25:52,204
Make a wish.

450
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,486
These are some nice products.

451
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:05,125
I use Olay.

452
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,126
- I'll take it.
- No, you will not.

453
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:09,084
Thank you. That's kind.
She loves it.

454
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:11,886
She doesn't know how to use it.
Here, eat your cake.

455
00:26:12,047 --> 00:26:14,641
So, what are you guys gonna do
with grandma's apartment?

456
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:21,964
We haven't really thought about it.

457
00:26:22,487 --> 00:26:25,126
Are you gonna break through,
make the living room bigger?

458
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:28,996
You know, a new bathroom, kitchen.
We were gonna renovate anyway, so...

459
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:30,998
You'll have to change the tile
in there.

460
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,286
It's all covered with mould.

461
00:26:33,447 --> 00:26:36,917
- I'd re-tile the whole thing.
- I'm sure they're gonna gut it.

462
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:39,806
You'll be dead,
so you don't have to worry about it.

463
00:26:42,247 --> 00:26:45,478
So, wait... So tell me
what else are you guys gonna do?

464
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:47,997
Kate, are you gonna add
an extra bedroom?

465
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:50,362
- Mary, come on, shut up.
- What?

466
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,239
- I mean...
- Grandma...

467
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:55,285
...can they show us what they're
gonna do with your apartment?

468
00:26:56,687 --> 00:26:59,565
Kate, what else are you gonna do?
What do you think?

469
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:05,476
Where exactly
are you gonna expand?

470
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:08,398
Well, we're gonna
break through that wall...

471
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:11,957
...and that'll be our master bedroom.
Over there is gonna be laundry room.

472
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:13,924
- Where?
- Right there.

473
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:16,476
That's so great.
Laundry is such a drag in the city.

474
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:19,844
It is. And the bedroom
will be a master bath and-

475
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:21,440
You're so lucky.

476
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,245
A proper closet, a real closet.

477
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:25,841
- It's gonna be gorgeous.
- Yeah, I know. I can't wait.

478
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:30,398
What do you mean? Of course we can
wait. We're not in any sort of rush here.

479
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:33,240
How's the cake?
How's that cake, Andra?

480
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:36,440
Dry.

481
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:45,125
You know, you were totally drunk.
It's embarrassing.

482
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:48,836
- I was not drunk.
- You're always drunk.

483
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:52,363
- You flirted.
- You don't even know what flirting is.

484
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:56,124
- You're an alcoholic.
- Why do you run around telling people...

485
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:57,481
...I use a tanning bed?

486
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:01,925
Well, because- It's because you lie.
On a tanning bed.

487
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:04,840
- So what? It's not hurting anybody.
- You're mean to Grandma.

488
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:07,282
She's a bitch.

489
00:28:09,247 --> 00:28:14,560
- How do you fuck in a wheelchair?
- Well, I guess you go on the bed.

490
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:19,319
I mean, even if the legs don't work
the middle part might, I guess, huh?

491
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:24,322
- Man, she's even worse than I thought.
- Yeah.

492
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,758
You don't even know the super's wife.

493
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,160
Andra.

494
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:31,406
Awful.

495
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:34,525
- It makes me feel bad for Rebecca.
- Makes me feel less guilty...

496
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:37,155
- ... waiting for her to die.
- Wanting her to die.

497
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:38,521
Shit.

498
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:43,321
- Can't we put a pillow over her head?
- And start construction?

499
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:46,402
Hey. You were flirting
with the sister.

500
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:47,795
I know.

501
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:51,678
I have no idea why.
She's such a bitch.

502
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,916
Because she's young and pretty.

503
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:02,797
- Hi.
- Get out.

504
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:31,402
- Morning.
- Good morning.

505
00:29:35,287 --> 00:29:36,879
Just gonna rewire this real quick.

506
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:39,436
Alex, come here for a second.

507
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:47,040
Another dealer is selling that table
for $5000.

508
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:49,767
That's great.
How much you pay for it?

509
00:29:49,927 --> 00:29:51,645
Four thousand
for the whole apartment.

510
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,081
The guy had no idea?

511
00:29:53,887 --> 00:29:55,605
He didn't wanna be bothered.

512
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,078
Then don't worry about it.

513
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:01,638
Let me know if I can help you
with anything.

514
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:03,638
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Sure.

515
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,039
Alex?

516
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:09,318
How come you feel so okay about it?

517
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:12,281
Because it's okay.

518
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:14,836
Okay.

519
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:17,043
I remember
when this was first in style.

520
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:19,198
I didn't like it then,
I don't like it now.

521
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,083
- How much is this one?
- Why are you asking?

522
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:26,876
- That is 8000.
- Okay.

523
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:30,881
- It's a sublime piece.
- I see.

524
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:33,481
- You can do many things with it.
- Thank you.

525
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:35,205
Sure.

526
00:31:00,247 --> 00:31:02,886
- Welcome to Skintology.
- Thank you very much.

527
00:31:04,047 --> 00:31:08,040
- Is Mary available for a facial?
- Which Mary? We actually have two.

528
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,156
Hi.

529
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:16,557
- How you doing?
- Great.

530
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:18,877
- Right this way.
- Okay.

531
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:26,197
They didn't get a good picture
or something.

532
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:30,406
No. You know, it happens.
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.

533
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:32,842
I feel bad making my grandson
schlep me back here.

534
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:35,475
He's a busy person. But single.

535
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:37,922
Never has a girlfriend,
I don't know why.

536
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:44,602
- You have a guy?
- No.

537
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:46,997
I mean, I'm trying.

538
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:48,566
You shouldn't have to try.

539
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:53,357
I went on a couple of computer dates.

540
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:57,042
- Oh, that must be awful.
- It was.

541
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:02,162
I figured if Howard Stern
can get a facial, so can I.

542
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,086
You know he had his nose done.

543
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:06,556
He looks great.
He's never gonna hit the wall.

544
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:09,321
I know. I love Howard.

545
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:11,236
Me too.

546
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:13,716
Eye cups. Close your eyes.

547
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:17,280
Oh, fancy. Really fancy.

548
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:19,639
- I love Artie.
- I know.

549
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,240
He kills me.

550
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:24,604
I wish I could play him all day
but I have to play this New Age shit.

551
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,723
Makes me want to kill myself.

552
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:31,637
I mean, what kind of guy tells the world
that he has a little tiny dick?

553
00:32:31,807 --> 00:32:33,843
How cool is that?

554
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:35,880
Kind of.

555
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:41,962
- You have nice skin.
- Thanks.

556
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,480
I had terrible skin as a kid.

557
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:47,356
You know, poor Abby. Face is covered
with zits. I guess it's hereditary, right?

558
00:32:47,527 --> 00:32:51,725
Well, you shouldn't blame yourself.
We'll let the steam open your pores.

559
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:01,404
Oh, it's part of the European facial.

560
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:03,603
Hand massage, shoulder massage.

561
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:04,756
Do you want it?

562
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:07,600
Sure.

563
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:40,559
It's okay. Don't- I'll get it.

564
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,162
I didn't know you were gonna do that.

565
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,285
Neither did I.

566
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:52,962
- Do you still want a facial?
- Yes, please.

567
00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:03,120
- Excuse me. Can you help me?
- Oh, sure.

568
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:07,724
Beautiful, isn't it? Perfect condition.

569
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,439
What are you asking for it?

570
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:14,843
Fifty-five hundred.

571
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:20,003
How about five thousand?

572
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:22,204
Okay.

573
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:31,038
- Hi.
- You promised today.

574
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:33,323
- What did I promise?
- Jeans.

575
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:35,640
- No fighting.
- No fighting.

576
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:36,956
Where'd you find this?

577
00:34:38,647 --> 00:34:41,366
- Really unusual colours.
- Yeah.

578
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:43,247
Excuse me.

579
00:34:44,007 --> 00:34:46,805
Do you know if everything's all right
with my grandmother?

580
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:48,559
You'll have to talk to the doctor.

581
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:52,766
He probably just saw something and
wants to make sure it's nothing.

582
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:58,043
- It's Rebecca, right?
- Yeah. Right.

583
00:34:58,207 --> 00:35:00,004
- Eugene.
- Hi. Again.

584
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,646
- Hi.
- Hi.

585
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:06,245
- She's terrific, your grandmother.
- Yeah, she is.

586
00:35:07,327 --> 00:35:10,478
She's pretty obvious too. You know,
she wants me to ask you out.

587
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:14,159
Right.

588
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:17,685
No, I meant that I want to.

589
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:23,315
- But?
- No but.

590
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,920
Would you like to go out with me?

591
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,887
Sure. Yes. Thank- Yeah.

592
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:36,478
Well, good. We can think
of something nice to do.

593
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:40,959
Actually, you know what?
I have some ideas.

594
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:42,960
Hi, sir.

595
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:46,880
- How are you?
- Good.

596
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:51,323
Five dollars?

597
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,842
Do you live on a sidewalk?

598
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,397
Those aren't bad.

599
00:35:57,607 --> 00:35:59,757
No, honey, they're not. Turn around.

600
00:36:02,007 --> 00:36:04,077
- I think these work.
- These suck.

601
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:05,839
- No, they don't.
- I look like a cow.

602
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:07,918
All right. Try those other ones on.

603
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:10,157
- Go ahead.
- What's the point?

604
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:11,999
Abby, just do it.

605
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:15,398
- She thinks she's fat.
- Shut up.

606
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:23,956
I like those.
I think those flaps are cool in the back.

607
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,158
They're in, anyway, right?

608
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:33,079
- Those are good.
- They're awful. I feel like a sausage.

609
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:34,521
I think they look cute.

610
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:37,759
- You think these look cute?
- Yeah. I do.

611
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:41,524
- Do you have eyes in your head?
- Please don't talk to me like that.

612
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:45,157
You must think I look like shit all
the time if you think these look good.

613
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:48,683
- I don't have to buy you anything.
- Fucking don't.

614
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:52,644
- How dare you? I'm leaving.
- Bye.

615
00:36:52,807 --> 00:36:58,677
- Buy your own fucking jeans.
- I would if I had my own money. Bitch.

616
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:10,836
Excuse me, we're about to close.

617
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:14,642
You can't stay in there all night.

618
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,279
I mean, she was so rude.
I'm at a total loss.

619
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:27,800
Do you have a stomach ache?

620
00:37:31,367 --> 00:37:33,119
Yeah, a bit.

621
00:37:33,687 --> 00:37:35,484
- Where have you been?
- The store.

622
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,839
- This late?
- New fall hours.

623
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:40,123
Go walk your dog.

624
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,961
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

625
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:48,561
- Hey. She's always there.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

626
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:50,206
My mom practically supports her.

627
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:52,927
- What do you mean?
- She always gives her money.

628
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:56,477
How do you think a homeless person
could have Chanel lipstick? It's gross.

629
00:37:56,647 --> 00:37:58,638
Your mom gives her
Chanel lipstick?

630
00:37:58,807 --> 00:38:01,037
She, like, wants to save the world.

631
00:38:01,407 --> 00:38:04,399
One time, she let a homeless lady
take a shower in our apartment.

632
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:07,081
Your mom? That's nice.

633
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:09,681
Yeah, until the lady took a dump
on my bedroom floor.

634
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:11,758
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

635
00:38:11,927 --> 00:38:14,646
She could've done it
in my mom's room. She let her in.

636
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:17,526
She gets all emotional
just walking down the street.

637
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:22,283
"Oh, my God. That man has no head.

638
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:25,120
Oh, my God,
that woman is disgusting. "

639
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:26,402
It's so embarrassing.

640
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:29,686
- Are you close with your mother?
- I don't have one.

641
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:33,237
- I mean, she's dead.
- That's horrible.

642
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:37,276
- How?
- She killed herself.

643
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:39,799
How old were you?

644
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:43,559
Mary was 20. I was 15.

645
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:46,723
I'm 15.

646
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:50,683
What about your dad?
He must've been so mad.

647
00:38:50,847 --> 00:38:53,042
No, he split
when we were really little.

648
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,596
He's somewhere,
but we don't know where.

649
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:59,726
- So who'd you live with?
- I lived with my grandmother.

650
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:02,602
This is so disgusting.

651
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:05,640
Right?

652
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:08,765
And now we're two people
walking around with shit in a bag.

653
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:13,685
I mean- I mean, what if we didn't have
dogs with us, and we were doing that?

654
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:17,203
That would be disgusting.
But because we have dogs, it's normal.

655
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:19,437
I never thought of that.

656
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:22,158
Do you come to your Grandma's
every night?

657
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:23,316
Almost.

658
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:26,797
- Why doesn't your sister come?
- She doesn't like her very much.

659
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:31,486
Mary's so cool. And gorgeous.

660
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,647
Do you think she could help me
with my skin?

661
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:46,283
- Can I help you find something?
- That's okay, I'm just looking.

662
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:48,324
Let me know if you have
any questions.

663
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,001
Thanks. This is great.

664
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:52,646
Yeah.

665
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:02,083
So, what makes you feel that this is
a good time, you know, to volunteer?

666
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:03,521
I mean, in your life.

667
00:40:03,687 --> 00:40:05,678
Well, something's telling me to do it.

668
00:40:05,847 --> 00:40:08,156
I just-
I wanna give something to someone.

669
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:11,763
Giving money is easy for me, but-
Thank god.

670
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,522
- I j- I want to do it.
- That's terrific.

671
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,281
A lot of the guests here
don't have family visit them.

672
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:20,915
If they do, it's generally once,
twice a year.

673
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,441
They love conversation.

674
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:26,679
And, of course, we keep it light.
Always wanna cheer them up.

675
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:32,285
- Cheer them up?
- We just don't wanna bring them down.

676
00:40:33,207 --> 00:40:36,677
Sometimes all they can think about
is dying, so they wanna talk about it.

677
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:38,075
Shouldn't we?

678
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:40,316
Makes them sad.

679
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:42,920
And this is the common area.

680
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:45,317
We watch movies in here
on Saturday nights.

681
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,637
And residents play cards,
and just hang out.

682
00:40:47,807 --> 00:40:50,037
- You could even play games with them.
- Oh, sure.

683
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,203
- Hi.
- Hi, Sandy.

684
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,119
Okay.

685
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:57,643
Maureen? This is Kate.
She might be volunteering here.

686
00:40:57,807 --> 00:40:59,559
Hi, Maureen.

687
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:05,755
- She's very bent over.
- She has rheumatoid arthritis.

688
00:41:05,927 --> 00:41:09,203
Oh, my God. Is it painful?
It looks very painful.

689
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:13,440
Yeah. But we try to be upbeat
and positive as much as we can.

690
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:17,322
Yeah. Yeah.

691
00:41:17,527 --> 00:41:20,519
It's fine. It's okay. Here. Come on.
Bye, Sandy.

692
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,723
I don't wanna meet anyone new
at my age.

693
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:24,605
You don't have to be friends
with her.

694
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:27,440
I'm sure she feels the same way
about me.

695
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:30,997
Why would two old ladies
wanna be friends at this age?

696
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,317
Look, we're just taking a drive,
Grandma.

697
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:36,320
Come on, the leaves are going to be
really pretty, right?

698
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:37,840
Look, I think they're here.

699
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:42,157
Mrs. Portman, I'm so sorry.
I heard about the results.

700
00:41:42,327 --> 00:41:44,363
When are you gonna
get the operation?

701
00:41:44,527 --> 00:41:46,324
The surgery is scheduled
for next month.

702
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:47,476
Right.

703
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:48,921
What have you got?

704
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:51,043
It's cancer, a big lump.

705
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:53,118
Oh, what a horror.

706
00:41:53,287 --> 00:41:56,006
The breast, it just comes off,
just like that.

707
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:59,603
Suppose you get a boyfriend,
then what?

708
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,166
You're funny, Andra.

709
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:05,001
See? She thinks I'm funny.

710
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:07,886
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Portman.
- It's okay. I'm an old lady.

711
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:10,720
It's a tragedy
when it's somebody young.

712
00:42:10,887 --> 00:42:12,923
And I've been lucky.

713
00:42:13,087 --> 00:42:14,964
Cancer is not lucky.

714
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,600
Okay, before the cancer.

715
00:42:19,207 --> 00:42:22,199
- You got a handsome boy there.
- Thank you, Andra.

716
00:42:23,127 --> 00:42:25,197
It's the truth.

717
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:29,603
- But he's very short.
- Grandma.

718
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:35,046
That's good. Otherwise, he would never
go for you if he was tall.

719
00:42:36,647 --> 00:42:41,801
Becca is a lovely girl,
and I'm sure a lot of boys notice her.

720
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:44,959
What did I say? I didn't say anything.

721
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:47,561
Sure.
How's your sandwich, Grandma?

722
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:51,838
Mine's not good, mine's bad.

723
00:42:52,007 --> 00:42:54,475
Okay. Well, mine's good.
You want some of mine?

724
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:58,526
- You want some of mine?
- No, yours looks bad too.

725
00:42:59,047 --> 00:43:01,959
You have a lot of friends left, Andra?

726
00:43:02,127 --> 00:43:04,436
Nobody's left.

727
00:43:04,607 --> 00:43:08,077
I had friends. Not a lot.

728
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:11,361
I was very selective.

729
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:14,724
Good for you.
It's good to be selective.

730
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:19,924
A lot of people were jealous of me.

731
00:43:21,007 --> 00:43:23,726
Because I was smart.

732
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:27,765
People often mistook me
for a school teacher.

733
00:43:27,927 --> 00:43:33,285
I never finished high school
but people thought I was smart.

734
00:43:34,247 --> 00:43:38,126
Well, I can see that.

735
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:41,879
So...

736
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:46,437
I think it should be somewhere
right around here.

737
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:00,958
This can't be it.

738
00:44:01,607 --> 00:44:03,006
Well, maybe we just missed it.

739
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:06,557
Maybe we're too late,
or it's been too hot or something.

740
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,922
What's everybody doing?

741
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,805
We're looking at the view.

742
00:44:13,407 --> 00:44:15,284
This is nothing.

743
00:44:24,487 --> 00:44:26,125
- This-
- Oh, my gosh.

744
00:44:26,287 --> 00:44:29,916
- This must be their peak.
- Yeah, this is the place.

745
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:31,884
Oh, my God.

746
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:34,242
It is pretty. Hey, Grandma.

747
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:37,405
Hey, Grandma.

748
00:45:16,807 --> 00:45:18,718
It's for my daughter.

749
00:45:18,887 --> 00:45:21,640
- How old is she?
- She's 15.

750
00:45:21,807 --> 00:45:25,482
- Having a really tough time.
- That's so sweet of you to buy this.

751
00:45:25,647 --> 00:45:26,841
She's going to love it.

752
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:38,478
- God, this is so cute.
- You like it?

753
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:41,957
Where'd you get it? Oh, Poppy.
What were you doing down there?

754
00:45:42,127 --> 00:45:46,962
- Isn't this cute, Mom?
- It is. It really is gorgeous.

755
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,965
Thanks, Dad.

756
00:45:49,127 --> 00:45:53,120
No matter how much lotion I put on
these things there's still just cracks.

757
00:45:55,007 --> 00:45:59,637
It's just- Maybe I should go see that
what's-her-name over at the spa.

758
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:01,957
Get a paraffin dunk...

759
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,724
...or whatever.

760
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,879
- She does facials, doesn't she?
- Who?

761
00:46:08,247 --> 00:46:11,876
- Who are you talking about?
- About the granddaughter with the tan.

762
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:15,084
- Who are you talking about?
- Same.

763
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:17,477
- She does facials?
- It's what she said.

764
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:24,800
Honestly, Mary,
they were so gorgeous.

765
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:27,686
Like they were on fire or something.

766
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:29,599
You should have worn sunscreen.

767
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:33,396
- Why? I don't think I got sunburned.
- Yes, you did.

768
00:46:33,687 --> 00:46:35,837
You could create permanent
sun damage.

769
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:37,406
Mary, you're not at work. God.

770
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,637
It's not just my work.
I believe in what I do.

771
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:42,560
- Oh, come on, you sunbathe.
- With sunscreen.

772
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,319
I look better with colour.

773
00:46:45,487 --> 00:46:49,196
You know, you're pretty.
You don't need to be tan.

774
00:46:53,127 --> 00:46:54,321
I can't stop.

775
00:46:54,887 --> 00:46:56,639
Just...

776
00:46:57,527 --> 00:46:59,757
I'm glad you had a good time.

777
00:47:01,367 --> 00:47:05,519
Hey, maybe Eugene has a brother
or a friend.

778
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:08,076
- Please.
- What?

779
00:47:08,247 --> 00:47:10,841
I don't need you
to set me up with a boyfriend.

780
00:47:11,007 --> 00:47:12,201
Sorry.

781
00:47:12,367 --> 00:47:14,517
If I wanted a boyfriend, I'd have one.

782
00:47:39,047 --> 00:47:41,481
You've made a very good choice.

783
00:47:41,647 --> 00:47:44,115
We had put aside a couple of things.

784
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:46,597
Very, very unusual.

785
00:47:59,647 --> 00:48:01,717
The Gemini initial too.

786
00:48:01,887 --> 00:48:05,118
And the colours are really amazing.

787
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:13,203
I would also like to point out a chair.

788
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:16,677
An extremely rare- Excuse me.

789
00:48:16,887 --> 00:48:21,278
This is an Eames chair.
It's very rare, 1942.

790
00:48:21,447 --> 00:48:23,483
That particular piece...

791
00:48:33,567 --> 00:48:35,523
Designer?

792
00:48:35,687 --> 00:48:37,166
Resting.

793
00:48:37,327 --> 00:48:39,079
I'm a designer.

794
00:48:39,247 --> 00:48:42,956
I buy a lot of things from Kevin.
He's got great taste, doesn't he?

795
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:45,436
Except for that awful thing.

796
00:48:45,607 --> 00:48:48,565
- That's a rare piece.
- It's still ugly.

797
00:48:48,727 --> 00:48:52,515
And I think it's haunted.
Got a bad vibe.

798
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:55,679
Old furniture has ghosts.

799
00:48:57,887 --> 00:48:59,843
I think so too.

800
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:02,760
How can they not? Right?

801
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:06,203
I had this bed. Iron. Victorian.

802
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:09,200
It was gorgeous. Fabulous detail.

803
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:13,201
I had nightmares for a year.
Then I developed TMJ.

804
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:18,361
Got rid of the bed. No more TMJ,
no more nightmares.

805
00:49:21,047 --> 00:49:22,799
Is he a nice guy?

806
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:24,156
Oh, prick.

807
00:49:26,887 --> 00:49:29,526
Good taste. Still a prick.

808
00:49:38,287 --> 00:49:42,246
I always wanted that Corbusier chaise
but I'm allergic to cowhide.

809
00:49:42,407 --> 00:49:45,126
I don't like sitting on things
with hair on them.

810
00:49:45,287 --> 00:49:48,165
I think my grandmother
had this exact couch.

811
00:49:48,327 --> 00:49:49,760
Where is it now?

812
00:49:49,927 --> 00:49:52,361
- Here, apparently.
- Someone's making a killing.

813
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:54,836
The couch is original
leather upholstery.

814
00:49:55,007 --> 00:49:57,646
- It's really beautiful.
- What a find.

815
00:49:57,807 --> 00:50:01,038
- Yeah.
- Where do you find your stuff?

816
00:50:02,047 --> 00:50:03,685
- Why?
- Well, I mean, like...

817
00:50:03,847 --> 00:50:07,601
...do you get it from individuals or is
there like a store in Queens you go to...

818
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:10,235
- ... and just pick stuff out?
- Individuals.

819
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:12,716
We buy from the children
of dead people.

820
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:15,003
- How nice.
- Yeah, it's fun.

821
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,520
What a dick.

822
00:50:16,687 --> 00:50:19,440
I feel like this would look good
in my house in New Paltz.

823
00:50:19,607 --> 00:50:21,757
On the wall or on the floor.
I don't know.

824
00:50:21,927 --> 00:50:24,361
I'm more of a floor rug person.

825
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:27,997
- It's actually a tapestry.
- No, it's not.

826
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:29,964
- Yeah, it's a tapestry.
- It's a rug.

827
00:50:30,687 --> 00:50:32,598
Okay. It's a rug or a tapestry.

828
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:34,519
I'm like 100 percent sure
that's a rug.

829
00:50:34,687 --> 00:50:36,803
I think you right. It's a rug.
Fucking idiot.

830
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,117
White, can I help you?
Yes, we do.

831
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:41,278
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Ambulance chasers.

832
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:44,120
I'm gonna make an appointment
for my wife to come see you.

833
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:46,039
Mom loved her things.

834
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:48,596
She just never told us
what to do with any of it.

835
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:52,157
- You from a Salvation Army?
- She's from a store on Tenth Avenue.

836
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:54,646
A junk store?

837
00:50:54,807 --> 00:50:59,358
No, actually, it's a vintage,
modern mid-century-

838
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:02,405
She doesn't want this shit.
I told you to call Salvation Army.

839
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:04,125
She can say
if she doesn't want it.

840
00:51:04,287 --> 00:51:06,755
- But she might.
- None of this is worth anything.

841
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:08,406
He just wasted your time.

842
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:11,161
Look at this chair. Look at it.

843
00:51:12,887 --> 00:51:15,276
This is a great chair.

844
00:51:17,527 --> 00:51:19,006
She died in it.

845
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:22,161
Oh, no, well, now she's really
gonna wanna buy it.

846
00:51:24,767 --> 00:51:27,804
Actually, I think there are some things
in here that I could take.

847
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:31,721
Definitely those
two bookshelves and...

848
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:36,004
This tea cart's pretty charming.

849
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:38,283
The lamp with the greenery.

850
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:42,364
It's very kitschy.
I think that we can sell it pretty easily.

851
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:44,040
How much?

852
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:47,715
- Two thousand.
- Are you serious?

853
00:51:51,047 --> 00:51:52,924
And the yellow chair.

854
00:51:53,607 --> 00:51:55,677
See, I told you? Mom had good taste.

855
00:51:55,847 --> 00:51:57,166
Yeah, she did.

856
00:51:57,687 --> 00:51:59,166
Use these.

857
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:01,520
I will not.

858
00:52:02,407 --> 00:52:04,363
What are you talking about,
"You will not"?

859
00:52:04,527 --> 00:52:05,880
I won't.

860
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:09,278
- You'll use my coupons.
- No, I won't.

861
00:52:10,087 --> 00:52:11,486
You're too good for coupons?

862
00:52:11,687 --> 00:52:15,202
They depress me. If you want me to go
shopping for you, give me your list.

863
00:52:15,367 --> 00:52:18,484
- I'll get Rebecca to do it.
- I told you, she's busy.

864
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:20,717
- Rebecca's never busy.
- Well, she's busy now.

865
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,639
And you should be happy for her.

866
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,526
- Give me your list.
- If you're not gonna take my coupons...

867
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:26,961
...I'll go shopping myself.

868
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:29,800
I came all the way down here.
And you can't walk that far.

869
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:32,435
You wait and see.
When my knees get better-

870
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,802
Arthritis gets worse, not better.

871
00:52:35,007 --> 00:52:36,486
Mine's gonna get better.

872
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:37,836
Okay.

873
00:52:38,007 --> 00:52:39,042
Like your eyes?

874
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:41,879
- Yes.
- And your feet?

875
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:45,044
Yes.

876
00:52:46,487 --> 00:52:48,523
Don't do me any favours.

877
00:52:49,847 --> 00:52:53,886
I'll get Rebecca to do it.
She didn't ask me so many questions.

878
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:05,679
Laugh and the world laughs
with you.

879
00:53:05,847 --> 00:53:08,839
Your feet hurt
because you're old, Grandma.

880
00:53:09,007 --> 00:53:11,202
Things get worse, not better.

881
00:53:12,127 --> 00:53:15,324
Movie audiences are reticent
to see their fav ourite funnymen in dra-

882
00:53:21,087 --> 00:53:23,442
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

883
00:53:23,607 --> 00:53:25,279
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

884
00:53:25,447 --> 00:53:27,597
She's got me going to the market
for her.

885
00:53:30,767 --> 00:53:31,995
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

886
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,600
Very well.

887
00:53:35,527 --> 00:53:37,677
You still got that tan.

888
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,042
It's kind of fading, actually.

889
00:53:41,287 --> 00:53:43,403
I think I'm hitting the wall.

890
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:51,125
Thanks.

891
00:53:53,527 --> 00:53:55,882
It's nice of you to shop for her.

892
00:53:56,047 --> 00:53:58,117
It's not like I have a choice.

893
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,317
I guess I could starve her to death.

894
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,998
So, where do you go shopping?

895
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:09,198
In a market.

896
00:54:17,047 --> 00:54:20,403
- Okay, well, bye. Later, see you.
- Okay. Good to see you again.

897
00:54:23,047 --> 00:54:26,119
I'm gonna go and do some errands.
Some stuff I've been putting off.

898
00:54:26,287 --> 00:54:29,962
- Okay. So I'll see you at the store.
- Okay. All right.

899
00:54:40,087 --> 00:54:43,284
So like, I don't know exactly
what it is you do.

900
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:46,723
Well, I'm, you know-
I'm a computer consultant.

901
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:48,843
Yeah. But what is that?

902
00:54:49,007 --> 00:54:53,080
Look, I'll tell you someday
when you want to go into a coma.

903
00:54:54,727 --> 00:54:58,959
- Now, you have a great job.
- Yeah?

904
00:54:59,127 --> 00:55:02,676
You know,
from a guy's point of view.

905
00:55:03,807 --> 00:55:05,365
- Okay.
- No, I just- Okay.

906
00:55:05,527 --> 00:55:08,803
Look, I just wonder
what made you decide to choose that.

907
00:55:08,967 --> 00:55:12,516
Yeah. You know, I wonder that too.

908
00:55:13,127 --> 00:55:15,357
Were you breast fed?

909
00:55:15,527 --> 00:55:17,199
- No, I doubt it.
- Well, there you go.

910
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:18,846
What?

911
00:55:19,527 --> 00:55:23,281
I mean, to be honest,
I don't really see them like breasts.

912
00:55:23,447 --> 00:55:28,123
I see them more like
they're these tubes of potential danger.

913
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:32,599
- Tubes of potential danger.
- Yeah.

914
00:55:35,887 --> 00:55:38,162
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

915
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,918
See you've got some new things.

916
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,679
All the time.

917
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,280
Where do you find all of this?

918
00:55:45,087 --> 00:55:46,486
Why?

919
00:55:47,567 --> 00:55:49,558
Just- Just curious.

920
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:51,401
I love this couch, honey.

921
00:55:57,207 --> 00:55:59,562
Excuse me. How much for this?

922
00:55:59,727 --> 00:56:03,356
- That's 4000.
- It's perfect for the playroom.

923
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:08,400
Oh, my God. Honey.
Take a look at this.

924
00:56:10,207 --> 00:56:12,004
That is so bad, it's almost great.

925
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:15,125
I don't know, honey. It's kind of ugly.

926
00:56:16,447 --> 00:56:18,403
Hey, miss. How much are these?

927
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:22,397
Those are 1400 for the pair.

928
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:24,521
Oh, are they important?

929
00:56:24,687 --> 00:56:28,760
Well, we're not sure of the provenance
but I think they're quite nice. Yeah.

930
00:56:52,087 --> 00:56:54,840
Come up here and fix the reception.

931
00:56:55,007 --> 00:57:00,320
Yes, it's your job. You're the super.
The super fixes things.

932
00:57:01,727 --> 00:57:03,319
Idiot.

933
00:57:12,127 --> 00:57:15,517
Leaving me here
without anything to eat.

934
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:19,206
Oh, shit.

935
00:57:19,367 --> 00:57:21,687
What a mess.

936
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:25,603
You know,
I've never cheated on Kate before.

937
00:57:25,767 --> 00:57:28,235
- How would I know that?
- Because I haven't.

938
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:30,398
So why now?

939
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,117
We're just like partners, you know?

940
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:36,882
We're partners at work.
We're partners as parents.

941
00:57:37,047 --> 00:57:39,561
Partners in life.

942
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:41,920
We're friends, right?

943
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:45,762
I like my friends.
I don't really have any.

944
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:47,485
Friends are good. They are.

945
00:57:47,647 --> 00:57:49,205
- How's she so skinny?
- What?

946
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:51,642
Kate, she's so beautiful
and she's so skinny.

947
00:57:51,807 --> 00:57:54,367
- How does she stay so skinny?
- She worries a lot.

948
00:57:54,527 --> 00:57:56,358
I worry a lot.

949
00:57:56,527 --> 00:57:58,279
And you're skinny.

950
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:06,482
I'm sorry.
This is all just such a mess.

951
00:58:06,647 --> 00:58:08,319
I'm a mess.

952
00:58:08,487 --> 00:58:12,002
And I really never should've
started this and I'm sorry.

953
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:14,237
- I apologise.
- You know what some people say?

954
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:18,923
They sat that it's hard to imagine why
someone would have an affair...

955
00:58:19,087 --> 00:58:21,840
...if there weren't something missing
in the marriage.

956
00:58:23,127 --> 00:58:24,924
You know what I mean?

957
00:58:28,207 --> 00:58:33,156
You know what else they say?
They also say sometimes it can help.

958
00:58:35,487 --> 00:58:38,479
You know? Maybe it will.

959
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,557
Sometimes that's what they say.

960
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:53,603
I don't want to fuck you anymore.

961
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:00,637
Have you ever thought about
killing yourself?

962
00:59:00,807 --> 00:59:02,445
No.

963
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:04,076
Why?

964
00:59:04,247 --> 00:59:07,284
Rebecca's mother killed herself.

965
00:59:07,447 --> 00:59:11,998
Oh, God, how horrible. No wonder.

966
00:59:12,167 --> 00:59:14,078
No wonder what?

967
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:18,045
You can see how damaged
those girls are.

968
00:59:19,687 --> 00:59:22,076
You don't ever think about
things like that, do you?

969
00:59:22,247 --> 00:59:23,805
No.

970
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:28,244
Hey, I wonder where our friend is.

971
00:59:28,407 --> 00:59:30,204
- Makeup man?
- Yeah.

972
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:33,086
Hopefully, he found a nice spot
near Sephora.

973
00:59:33,887 --> 00:59:36,162
I hope nothing happened to her.

974
00:59:36,327 --> 00:59:40,718
- You're worried.
- A little. She lives on the street.

975
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:43,242
You don't even know her.

976
00:59:43,407 --> 00:59:46,205
Oh, God, look at this.

977
00:59:49,447 --> 00:59:51,597
Hi. Here you go.

978
00:59:51,767 --> 00:59:52,756
- No way.
- Abby.

979
00:59:52,927 --> 00:59:55,441
You don't give me 20 dollars.

980
00:59:55,607 --> 00:59:59,122
Abby. Give this man that money
right now, we'll discuss this later.

981
00:59:59,287 --> 01:00:01,005
- No.
- Give it to me.

982
01:00:01,167 --> 01:00:03,283
This is insane.

983
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,964
- I buy you everything you need.
- I'm keeping this 20 dollars.

984
01:00:07,127 --> 01:00:09,118
Abby, please.

985
01:00:09,687 --> 01:00:13,043
- Abby, I don't have another 20.
- So give him the 5.

986
01:00:13,207 --> 01:00:14,925
- Give him the 20.
- So give him the 5.

987
01:00:15,087 --> 01:00:17,237
- Give him the 20.
- No.

988
01:00:22,567 --> 01:00:24,000
I'm sorry. I'm ashamed.

989
01:00:26,007 --> 01:00:27,679
I'm sorry.

990
01:00:58,047 --> 01:01:00,880
Honey, I just gotta ask.
What you were thinking?

991
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:03,199
This guy, this poor guy. His-

992
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:07,883
His wife or sister, whomever,
was just so mean.

993
01:01:08,047 --> 01:01:11,835
I had to buy it. I felt so bad for him.

994
01:01:12,247 --> 01:01:16,160
I mean, who's to say
this stuff isn't valuable?

995
01:01:16,327 --> 01:01:18,158
I can. This stuff is not valuable.

996
01:01:18,327 --> 01:01:21,763
Somebody liked it.
I mean, in 15 years this chair...

997
01:01:21,927 --> 01:01:23,565
...will be worth a ton of money...

998
01:01:23,727 --> 01:01:28,039
...because some genius German
designer, you know, designed it.

999
01:01:28,207 --> 01:01:30,243
We're not gonna sell any of this shit.

1000
01:01:32,447 --> 01:01:35,757
I already sold two shelves
for 1400 dollars.

1001
01:01:35,927 --> 01:01:37,804
- You did? That's great.
- No, it's not.

1002
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:41,323
- I don't feel very good about it.
- I don't understand.

1003
01:01:41,487 --> 01:01:43,364
I practically stole from them.

1004
01:01:43,527 --> 01:01:45,882
Well, then why did you charge them
a ton of money?

1005
01:01:46,047 --> 01:01:47,196
I wanted to.

1006
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:53,882
I've been feeling
really suspicious lately, Alex.

1007
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:56,647
People have been coming in
asking questions.

1008
01:01:56,807 --> 01:02:00,243
- Like what?
- "Where does your stuff come from?"

1009
01:02:00,407 --> 01:02:02,443
- " How do you get it?"
- People are like that.

1010
01:02:02,607 --> 01:02:05,644
They're curious. They're curious about
where the stuff comes from.

1011
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:09,482
No. This is different.
People who we've bought stuff from...

1012
01:02:09,647 --> 01:02:12,400
...are sending in friends,
or lawyers...

1013
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:15,639
...to find out how much we're selling
these things for.

1014
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,275
- Your guilt is warping you.
- Why isn't it warping you?

1015
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:20,324
It is. Your guilt is warping me.

1016
01:02:20,767 --> 01:02:24,077
If this makes you feel so bad, if doing
this makes you feel so crappy...

1017
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:25,839
...do something else.
Stop doing it.

1018
01:02:26,007 --> 01:02:28,362
Then somebody else
will just do what we're doing.

1019
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:30,882
That guy on Eighth Avenue,
with the store...

1020
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:35,040
...he's selling stuff that
he bought from us for more money.

1021
01:02:36,327 --> 01:02:40,366
Quitting isn't gonna help anything,
Alex. Nothing helps.

1022
01:02:41,727 --> 01:02:44,685
- I have because-
It's not that often I get to do this...

1023
01:02:44,847 --> 01:02:47,077
...and, you know,
this is part of entertaining.

1024
01:02:48,127 --> 01:02:50,883
If you have nice pieces lik e this,
you get to show them off.

1025
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:52,366
Grandma?

1026
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:54,566
Grandma?

1027
01:02:55,047 --> 01:02:59,165
Now, look at this. Just spectacular.
Absolutely wonderful.

1028
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:01,045
Oh, my God.

1029
01:03:01,767 --> 01:03:04,679
- and all this crudits aside.

1030
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:08,476
You wanna bring this out to the table,
you know, especially with appetizers.

1031
01:03:08,647 --> 01:03:11,320
I have to show off for a moment.

1032
01:03:17,367 --> 01:03:21,246
Right this way.
This, obviously, is the gym.

1033
01:03:21,407 --> 01:03:24,160
The kids come here
three times a week to play sports.

1034
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:29,561
This is something you could
actually help out with.

1035
01:03:34,407 --> 01:03:38,002
And the cones
are not confusing at all.

1036
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:40,762
- What do you mean?
- There's, you know...

1037
01:03:40,927 --> 01:03:42,804
It's a drill.

1038
01:03:43,847 --> 01:03:46,315
Sweetie. Come here.

1039
01:03:47,927 --> 01:03:50,805
This is Kate.
She's gonna be helping out.

1040
01:03:50,967 --> 01:03:53,959
Kate, this is Abby.
Abby, this is Kate.

1041
01:03:54,127 --> 01:03:56,846
- Thank you. Thank you, Kate.
- Nice to meet you.

1042
01:03:57,007 --> 01:03:58,838
Abby is one of our most athletic.

1043
01:03:59,007 --> 01:04:00,645
- Isn't that right, Abby?
- Yes, I am.

1044
01:04:00,807 --> 01:04:02,718
Wanna show Kate
how well you shoot a hoop?

1045
01:04:02,887 --> 01:04:04,684
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

1046
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:12,007
Good job, Abby.

1047
01:04:19,327 --> 01:04:20,885
- You wanna have a shot?
- No.

1048
01:04:21,047 --> 01:04:22,924
- Go ahead. Give it a try.
- Go on. Try it.

1049
01:04:23,087 --> 01:04:25,203
You try, you fail.
You try, you fail.

1050
01:04:25,367 --> 01:04:27,278
Try again.

1051
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,039
Thank you.

1052
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,003
Very good.

1053
01:04:40,607 --> 01:04:42,325
Thank you.

1054
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:46,319
What are you doing?

1055
01:04:48,247 --> 01:04:50,522
Are you okay?

1056
01:04:50,927 --> 01:04:53,839
I'm sorry. It's just so sad.

1057
01:04:54,047 --> 01:04:57,244
You should go. Really.

1058
01:04:57,767 --> 01:04:59,359
Okay.

1059
01:04:59,527 --> 01:05:00,755
I'm sorry.

1060
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:09,846
Kate?

1061
01:05:15,687 --> 01:05:17,245
You need any help?

1062
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:22,281
Do you want someone to help you?

1063
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:25,800
I'll be okay. I'm okay.

1064
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:36,885
You know, I should've been here.

1065
01:05:37,047 --> 01:05:38,639
- I would have been here.
- Please.

1066
01:05:38,807 --> 01:05:41,162
If I'd bought her groceries
I would have been here.

1067
01:05:41,327 --> 01:05:43,716
What are you-?
Why didn't you buy her groceries?

1068
01:05:43,887 --> 01:05:46,276
I thought you were supposed to.

1069
01:05:47,647 --> 01:05:50,286
Here's something she got
a lot of use from.

1070
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:53,484
No special occasion, Grandma.
You should have worn the fucker.

1071
01:05:53,647 --> 01:05:57,242
Don't do that. That's mean.
Stop it. Stop it.

1072
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:01,079
She was mean.
Why do you think Mom took 85 Valium?

1073
01:06:01,247 --> 01:06:03,044
Because her mother
was loving and kind?

1074
01:06:03,207 --> 01:06:05,960
- You can't blame Grandma.
- Why not?

1075
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:08,004
We don't have any family anymore.

1076
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:10,476
I gotta go back to work.

1077
01:06:10,687 --> 01:06:12,678
I have appointments.

1078
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:14,599
You'll wait for the guy?

1079
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:17,283
Grandma's dead
and you're going to work?

1080
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,285
You're right.

1081
01:06:32,887 --> 01:06:34,081
Oh, look.

1082
01:06:34,247 --> 01:06:37,000
She's still dead. Bye.

1083
01:06:37,207 --> 01:06:39,482
- You know, you're really cold.
- I know.

1084
01:07:05,407 --> 01:07:07,398
Oh, hi.

1085
01:07:07,567 --> 01:07:09,762
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm just-

1086
01:07:09,927 --> 01:07:12,600
I guess washing dishes just makes me
want to kill myself.

1087
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,919
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry. It's an ex-
- Oh, no. I know. I know.

1088
01:07:17,487 --> 01:07:21,162
I just wanted to tell you
that my grandma died.

1089
01:07:21,367 --> 01:07:23,323
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1090
01:07:23,487 --> 01:07:26,160
Come inside, please. Please.

1091
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:32,716
Do you think you could die if you
ate something from a dented can?

1092
01:07:32,887 --> 01:07:36,562
You think that's what happened?
I don't think- I don't think so.

1093
01:07:36,727 --> 01:07:41,755
Okay. No, I've just been taking care
of her for a really long time, you know?

1094
01:07:41,927 --> 01:07:45,556
This pill that day, this doctor,
that medicine, not that medicine.

1095
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:49,037
And then she dies
from drinking bad juice.

1096
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:52,123
That didn't happen.

1097
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:54,560
Yeah.

1098
01:07:57,927 --> 01:08:02,796
You're a really good person.

1099
01:08:02,967 --> 01:08:04,366
You are.

1100
01:08:05,807 --> 01:08:08,685
Thank you. Thanks.

1101
01:08:15,607 --> 01:08:16,801
So are you.

1102
01:08:27,127 --> 01:08:28,924
Can I help you with something?

1103
01:08:30,447 --> 01:08:33,359
Yeah, that would be great.
Maybe in a while, when they come...

1104
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:36,439
...it would be great
if you could be with me. Thank you.

1105
01:08:59,647 --> 01:09:01,683
Welcome to Skintology.
How can I help you?

1106
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:03,917
I'd like a facial with Mary, please.

1107
01:09:04,087 --> 01:09:05,725
Okay, we have two Marys.
Which one?

1108
01:09:06,447 --> 01:09:09,439
- Brown hair? Blonde hair?
- Brown.

1109
01:09:11,367 --> 01:09:13,198
She actually had a cancellation...

1110
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:15,085
- ... if you can wait 30 minutes.
- Sure.

1111
01:09:33,727 --> 01:09:36,844
Well, this worked out well.
It's a surprise to see you.

1112
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:39,805
Becca said she thought you could
do something for my pimples.

1113
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,764
I definitely can.

1114
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:46,921
We'll just open up your pores
and clean you out.

1115
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:51,918
Ever had a facial?

1116
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,123
My mom took me for one once
at this really fancy place.

1117
01:09:56,287 --> 01:09:59,757
But it didn't work. They just rubbed a
bunch of cream on and made it worse.

1118
01:09:59,927 --> 01:10:03,602
That's too bad. Just know
it's not your fault. It's hereditary.

1119
01:10:04,607 --> 01:10:06,325
Yeah, my dad supposedly
had bad skin.

1120
01:10:06,487 --> 01:10:08,478
That's right, he said it was terrible.

1121
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:10,126
Yeah.

1122
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:13,275
He had it for a long time too.

1123
01:10:16,407 --> 01:10:19,365
- How do you know that?
- He comes in for facials.

1124
01:10:19,527 --> 01:10:22,564
- My dad?
- Hey, Howard Stern gets them.

1125
01:10:22,727 --> 01:10:24,524
Not from me, but a lot of men do.

1126
01:10:31,207 --> 01:10:33,562
Is it okay if I take these off?
They're bugging me.

1127
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,445
Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.

1128
01:10:44,647 --> 01:10:47,764
Sorry, honey. It's not fun.

1129
01:10:49,567 --> 01:10:51,797
My grandmother died.

1130
01:10:52,007 --> 01:10:53,804
She did?

1131
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,317
Now your mom can have
her master bedroom.

1132
01:10:57,527 --> 01:11:02,078
That's too bad.
I mean, I'm sorry she died.

1133
01:11:03,127 --> 01:11:04,526
- When did it happen?
- Not sure.

1134
01:11:04,687 --> 01:11:07,997
We found her today,
so probably last night.

1135
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:09,759
Oh, here's a deep one.

1136
01:11:09,927 --> 01:11:13,715
- Wiggle your toes.
- Okay.

1137
01:11:14,087 --> 01:11:18,000
- Why?
- I don't know. It's supposed to help.

1138
01:11:20,047 --> 01:11:22,845
That's like one of those things
that we hate.

1139
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:24,556
What?

1140
01:11:24,727 --> 01:11:26,638
Like when people won't tell you
the truth.

1141
01:11:26,807 --> 01:11:29,640
- Like, if you look bad in something.
- Oh, I don't follow.

1142
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:34,437
Like, saying wiggle your toes
it's just, like, a- Whatever.

1143
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:41,200
So.

1144
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:44,598
When did my dad come here?
I can't picture it.

1145
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,041
He's come in a few times.

1146
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:50,716
But he doesn't have bad skin.
What would he come in for?

1147
01:11:51,927 --> 01:11:53,838
This and that.

1148
01:11:56,607 --> 01:11:58,006
This and that?

1149
01:12:06,047 --> 01:12:08,766
We should do an enzyme peel.
We get all the-

1150
01:12:09,127 --> 01:12:11,197
And then get all the dead skin off.

1151
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:14,757
It kind of looks like you've been
hit by a truck right afterwards...

1152
01:12:14,927 --> 01:12:16,804
...but in the end it's worth it.

1153
01:12:16,967 --> 01:12:18,639
Does the building have a back door?

1154
01:12:18,807 --> 01:12:21,765
You know, for deliveries,
things like that?

1155
01:12:21,927 --> 01:12:25,761
So we don't have to go out the front.
You know, not a glamorous sight.

1156
01:12:25,927 --> 01:12:28,680
Yeah. In the basement
there's a door to the alley...

1157
01:12:28,847 --> 01:12:33,079
...but, you know, there's always
a ton of stuff blocking it.

1158
01:12:33,367 --> 01:12:36,996
I think maybe there's an exit
through the super's apartment.

1159
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:39,522
I know it's really messy.

1160
01:12:39,687 --> 01:12:42,520
So sorry about your grandmother.

1161
01:12:44,487 --> 01:12:47,320
She make me fix her TV.
She doesn't even give me any money.

1162
01:12:47,487 --> 01:12:49,557
I see her last night.
She's not dead then.

1163
01:12:49,727 --> 01:12:51,877
She be yelling at me
like I'm some kind of kid.

1164
01:12:52,047 --> 01:12:53,480
I'm sorry she did that.

1165
01:12:53,647 --> 01:12:58,277
- Can I give you something?
- I don't need a tip. She's dead.

1166
01:12:58,927 --> 01:13:02,203
Yeah. Okay, thank you. Should we-?

1167
01:13:02,367 --> 01:13:04,801
I'm happy to see
that you're feeling better.

1168
01:13:04,967 --> 01:13:07,401
I was not sick.

1169
01:13:07,927 --> 01:13:10,600
But weren't you in a-
You were in a wheelchair, right?

1170
01:13:11,407 --> 01:13:13,682
- Me?
- Yeah.

1171
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:15,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

1172
01:13:15,367 --> 01:13:18,325
Who told you I was in wheelchair?
I was never in a wheelchair.

1173
01:13:18,487 --> 01:13:21,843
- I must've thought it was somebody-
- Why are you saying this to me?

1174
01:13:24,287 --> 01:13:25,720
Where did you get that?

1175
01:13:25,887 --> 01:13:28,082
- What?
- This.

1176
01:13:29,007 --> 01:13:30,440
- This?
- Yeah. The box.

1177
01:13:31,887 --> 01:13:33,525
It was a gift.

1178
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:37,005
Okay.

1179
01:13:50,767 --> 01:13:51,836
Andra died.

1180
01:13:52,727 --> 01:13:54,126
I know.

1181
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:56,562
- You do?
- Yeah.

1182
01:13:56,727 --> 01:13:59,002
Oh my god, honey.
What happened to your face?

1183
01:13:59,207 --> 01:14:00,606
I just had a facial.

1184
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:04,123
- From whom?
- Mary.

1185
01:14:04,727 --> 01:14:06,160
What did she do to you?

1186
01:14:06,927 --> 01:14:11,637
She gave me a peel.
And then she worked on me forever.

1187
01:14:12,927 --> 01:14:15,680
Honey, this should not look like this.
I'm calling her now.

1188
01:14:15,847 --> 01:14:17,599
- No, no.
- Honey.

1189
01:14:17,767 --> 01:14:21,555
It's not her fault I have bad skin.
This is normal.

1190
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,200
She said it would go away.

1191
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:30,285
It will. It'll go away.
It will go away.

1192
01:15:08,127 --> 01:15:09,845
Who are you?

1193
01:15:10,087 --> 01:15:13,284
I've seen you walk by, over and over.
For months.

1194
01:15:13,447 --> 01:15:15,881
And then you come in
and pretend to shop.

1195
01:15:16,047 --> 01:15:18,277
- Why are you watching me?
- I love your store.

1196
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,677
And I'm also- I'm...

1197
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,524
I'm Brian's ex-girlfriend, Mary.

1198
01:15:26,807 --> 01:15:29,924
- And?
- No, I just-

1199
01:15:30,207 --> 01:15:33,643
I guess I just wanted to see
what he threw me over for.

1200
01:15:35,247 --> 01:15:38,080
So that's why you watch me?

1201
01:15:39,847 --> 01:15:44,125
I was curious to see what he thought
you have that I don't have.

1202
01:15:44,287 --> 01:15:46,676
And did you figure out
what that was?

1203
01:15:47,207 --> 01:15:48,435
No.

1204
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:51,283
You have nothing.

1205
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:54,404
You have a very large back.

1206
01:15:56,127 --> 01:15:59,437
What kind of person, at your age,
does something like this?

1207
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,685
You know, it's very sad.

1208
01:16:01,847 --> 01:16:04,600
You're old and you're a stalker.

1209
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,083
Loser.

1210
01:16:21,047 --> 01:16:23,641
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1211
01:16:25,367 --> 01:16:27,323
Rough pimple night?

1212
01:16:29,647 --> 01:16:31,956
Mary gave me a facial.

1213
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,999
Mary?

1214
01:16:36,847 --> 01:16:38,439
Yeah.

1215
01:16:40,047 --> 01:16:41,958
Oh, you mean, like...

1216
01:16:42,287 --> 01:16:44,721
...next-door granddaughter Mary?

1217
01:16:47,647 --> 01:16:50,286
She's not very good, is she?
No offence.

1218
01:16:51,087 --> 01:16:52,839
Don't worry.
I'm not going back there.

1219
01:16:54,207 --> 01:16:55,879
Of course not.

1220
01:16:56,047 --> 01:16:57,480
Neither should you.

1221
01:16:57,647 --> 01:17:01,242
- Me?
- She said you went there.

1222
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:06,802
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1223
01:17:08,047 --> 01:17:09,526
She...

1224
01:17:10,887 --> 01:17:14,004
She helped me with my skin.

1225
01:17:18,327 --> 01:17:21,239
At my age, I mean, God knows.

1226
01:17:22,367 --> 01:17:24,244
When does it stop?

1227
01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:31,960
Yeah.

1228
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:36,245
No. No one is ever going back there.

1229
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:39,195
Ever.

1230
01:17:48,727 --> 01:17:50,638
How's she doing?

1231
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:53,723
She's sad.

1232
01:17:55,127 --> 01:17:57,482
It's so rough, her age.

1233
01:18:24,487 --> 01:18:26,523
We should stand back, you know.

1234
01:18:26,687 --> 01:18:29,247
- Why?
- Microwaves are bad for you.

1235
01:18:30,407 --> 01:18:32,716
But we're cooking our food in it.

1236
01:18:32,887 --> 01:18:35,481
They say it's different,
what comes out.

1237
01:18:42,527 --> 01:18:47,726
The city of Honolulu
is on which Hawaiian island?

1238
01:18:47,927 --> 01:18:50,395
- Oahu.
- Yes. Good choice.

1239
01:18:50,567 --> 01:18:53,286
All right. Way to go, Lala.

1240
01:18:54,767 --> 01:18:58,919
This next question is unusually tough.
Okay? But you can do this.

1241
01:18:59,087 --> 01:19:01,806
Name the South American city
best known...

1242
01:19:01,967 --> 01:19:06,199
...for its annual
Carnival celebrations.

1243
01:19:07,607 --> 01:19:09,404
Do you know South America?
Geography?

1244
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:13,446
Not really. I'm just gonna have
to tak e a guess on this one.

1245
01:19:13,767 --> 01:19:15,644
Santiago.

1246
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:19,801
I'm terribly sorry.
The correct answer is Rio.

1247
01:19:39,527 --> 01:19:42,246
- Oh, can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Kate. Hi.

1248
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:44,875
I bought your mother's furniture
a while back.

1249
01:19:45,047 --> 01:19:47,481
- Yeah.
- I wanted you to have this.

1250
01:19:47,647 --> 01:19:50,241
It turned out to be worth
a bit of money.

1251
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:54,678
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1252
01:19:55,607 --> 01:19:59,486
- I thought it was all junk.
- No, no, no.

1253
01:20:00,007 --> 01:20:02,316
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1254
01:20:03,047 --> 01:20:06,722
- How much is it worth?
- About $700.

1255
01:20:07,407 --> 01:20:09,716
I can't believe you brought it back.
That's-

1256
01:20:09,887 --> 01:20:12,720
- That's pretty unusual.
- It was my pleasure, really.

1257
01:20:13,327 --> 01:20:14,840
Bye.

1258
01:20:17,927 --> 01:20:19,565
Shit.

1259
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:22,685
Andra participated
in many groups over the years...

1260
01:20:22,847 --> 01:20:25,486
...and especially enjoyed
volunteering.

1261
01:20:26,007 --> 01:20:28,885
She worked at the ASPCA
when she was a teenager...

1262
01:20:29,047 --> 01:20:31,083
...and later on read to the blind...

1263
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:35,035
...and did art projects
with underprivileged children.

1264
01:20:35,207 --> 01:20:37,675
She enjoyed reading a great deal...

1265
01:20:37,847 --> 01:20:40,236
...but when her eyes began to fail...

1266
01:20:40,407 --> 01:20:43,843
...she especially loved
watching television.

1267
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:48,120
Her favourite show was
Entertainment Tonight.

1268
01:20:48,287 --> 01:20:50,084
Okay, so this is Eugene and Paulette.

1269
01:20:50,247 --> 01:20:51,885
- This is Alex. And this is-
- Hi.

1270
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,799
- Alex. How are you?
- This is Kate.

1271
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:55,878
Hi, Paulette.

1272
01:20:56,047 --> 01:20:58,686
Andra was a lovely woman.

1273
01:20:59,127 --> 01:21:01,402
Not really. But thanks.

1274
01:21:01,567 --> 01:21:03,125
She was very direct.

1275
01:21:03,287 --> 01:21:06,802
- She had a sad life. She did.
- Maybe.

1276
01:21:08,407 --> 01:21:10,159
So you're going to start renovating?

1277
01:21:10,767 --> 01:21:13,042
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Pretty soon.

1278
01:21:13,207 --> 01:21:14,560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1279
01:21:14,727 --> 01:21:16,638
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

1280
01:21:16,807 --> 01:21:20,516
It'll be bigger. It'll be fine.
Who cares?

1281
01:21:21,007 --> 01:21:24,158
- I'm gonna take her dog. So...
- Oh, that's great.

1282
01:21:24,327 --> 01:21:27,080
But I guess it means I won't be
seeing you guys anymore.

1283
01:21:27,247 --> 01:21:28,885
Oh, that's true.

1284
01:21:29,047 --> 01:21:32,437
- We've sort of been neighbours. It's...
- Yeah.

1285
01:21:37,327 --> 01:21:39,318
Her boyfriend was so handsome.

1286
01:21:39,487 --> 01:21:41,523
He was. Very.

1287
01:21:41,687 --> 01:21:43,518
Seemed so nice.

1288
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:45,639
He's pretty short.

1289
01:21:45,807 --> 01:21:47,798
Not that short.

1290
01:21:47,967 --> 01:21:49,605
Maybe he doesn't mind.

1291
01:21:49,767 --> 01:21:51,883
Oh, he minds.

1292
01:21:52,047 --> 01:21:55,676
- You can't know that.
- Yes, she can.

1293
01:22:21,807 --> 01:22:23,604
What do you think?

1294
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:26,757
I think they look good.

1295
01:22:29,847 --> 01:22:33,123
I think they cost $235.

1296
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:35,243
You wanna get them?

1297
01:22:35,887 --> 01:22:38,242
- Really?
- If you want them.

1298
01:22:38,407 --> 01:22:40,318
Oh, my God.

1299
01:22:45,367 --> 01:22:47,164
Thank you.

1300
01:22:48,287 --> 01:22:50,323
You're welcome.
