00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,387
So we're planning our next vacation.
I want Australia, she wants Italy.

32
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:04,391
I like snorkeling. She likes garlic.

33
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,812
All of a sudden, out of nowhere,
she says to me: "do I need her?"

34
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,441
Jesus, Benny.
What kind of a question is that?

35
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,944
Need? What does it really mean
to need somebody?

36
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,238
Benny, fuel line.

37
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,159
Waldo, could you answer that phone?

38
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:27,080
- Hello.
- I need a check, Benny. COD.

39
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,458
In a minute. Meet me in the office.

40
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,627
All right.

41
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,880
Put that out!
I got a fuel line broke.

42
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,966
Hey, Benny.
Joon's on the phone again.

43
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,802
I'll call back.
Find out what she wants.

44
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,138
It's an emergency.

45
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,391
She says you're runnin' low
on Peanut Butter Super Chunks.

46
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,479
An emergency...

47
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,987
The issue is jelly.
You only like two kinds.

48
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,160
You either like grape or boysenberry.
Which is it? All right.

49
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,663
Yeah, yeah, yeah, peanut butter.
I know. Super Crunch.

50
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,666
I'll see you at six, OK? Bye.

51
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,294
Thanks for waitin', ma'am.

52
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,714
I'm afraid the best
we can do for you is gonna be...

53
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,926
It's gonna be $750.

54
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,929
If you check around, you'll see that
that is a really good deal.

55
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,138
Yeah?

56
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,557
That is a really
very good deal, ma'am.

57
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,061
A little too good.

58
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,856
Let's do it.

59
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,541
Come here. Come here.

60
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,763
You're not doing yourjob!
What is yourjob, anyway?

61
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,391
To clean this house, but
not any more!

62
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,018
Get out of my sight!

63
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,395
You wouldn't dare,
Joon!

64
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,066
What is going on here? Joon?

65
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:21,111
Mrs. Smail, please, let me explain.

66
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,072
Beware, the winds of reason
shall blow stern.

67
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,241
- What?
- I'm done, Mr. Pearl.

68
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,577
I'm done! The mule's turned to glue!

69
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,164
She wanders off unescorted.
She has sudden outbursts.

70
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,416
She's simply unmanageable.

71
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,919
Mrs. Smail, wait.
Please, let me talk to her.

72
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,673
I can talk to her.
You can't quit on such short notice.

73
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,468
I'm sorry, sir.
In Ireland, we have a sayin'.

74
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,763
"When a boat runs ashore,
the sea has spoken. "

75
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,894
Come on! We can't play
three-handed poker.

76
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:58,482
She's gonna be alone every day.
I'm not leavin' her alone at night, too.

77
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,859
So bring her.
She just paints and reads.

78
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,445
Yeah, and lights things on fire.

79
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,074
That happened once. I got a
fire extinguisher. Just bring her.

80
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,952
Get your ass over here.
Don't forget the Louis Prima record.

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,205
Remember, always play for keeps.

82
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,167
All right, all right, all right.
Yeah, I'll be there. OK.

83
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,546
Joon, dinner!

84
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,101
Spaghetti and salad?

85
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,353
In that order?

86
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,649
What happened between
you and Mrs. Smail?

87
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,820
She was given to fits of
semiprecious metaphors.

88
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,656
She's a housekeeper,
not an English professor.

89
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,116
She moves things.

90
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,661
She said you wandered off.

91
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,204
Did you leave the house alone?

92
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,499
Define "alone. "

93
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,919
You know full well
what I'm talkin' about.

94
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:07,175
I can't be worried about you knocking
another housekeeper into retirement.

95
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,594
First, it was Mrs. Larkspur.

96
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,097
A woman deeply
and hygienically disturbed.

97
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,935
- Her hair smelled.
- But then it was Mrs. Piltz.

98
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,564
Piltz? The answer's in the question.

99
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,529
Let's face it, Benjamin.
Hiring housekeepers is not your forte.

100
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,699
Well, until I do find
another housekeeper,

101
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,493
you are gonna stick close
to the house.

102
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,745
Understand?

103
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:42,210
Now have some salad. By the way, I want
you to come with me to my poker game.

104
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,715
- Benny...
- Come on. You'll have a good time.

105
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,885
Web belt and buckle.

106
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,515
Classical Greek martini shaker.

107
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,934
Six turkey-feather darts.

108
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,104
I'll see you with a Deanna Durbin album.

109
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,814
Come on.

110
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:51,029
- And I'll raise you with a stethoscope.
- Does it have little plastic earpieces?

111
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,534
- What do you care? You never win, Mike.
- I don't want 'em stabbin' my eardrums.

112
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,452
Steering-wheel knob.

113
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,330
Salad Shooter.

114
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,583
'56 Plymouth tire iron.

115
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,462
- Fold-o.
- You must have a good hand, huh?

116
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,215
No, I'm bluffin'.

117
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,760
Really?

118
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,890
Come on. You gotta play to find out.

119
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:23,144
OK. 150 feet of coaxial cable. Show 'em.

120
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,982
- Full house. Jacks over fours.
- Oh, shit.

121
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,194
I thought he was bluffin'.

122
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,656
Will someone get some air to his brain?

123
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,199
He was bluffing about bluffing.

124
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,744
You're a real pal, Benny.

125
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:44,165
I got a solution to your housekeeper
problem. You can have my roommate.

126
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:49,337
That's a terrific offer, Benjamin. Save
you from the chore of Smail shopping.

127
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,798
Those places are such drudgery.

128
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,385
Montgomery and Smails,
Smails and Roebuck, Smails-R-Us...

129
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,761
Joon.

130
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,933
- When did you get a roommate?
- Since last week.

131
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,605
My cousin pounded into town and life's
gone from heaven to hell in seven days.

132
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,651
- Just like the good Lord intended.
- 26 years old, he can't even read.

133
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,321
Spends all day polishing
my plastic forks.

134
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:17,866
When you say he can't read,
what do you mean? Like words?

135
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:22,037
Yeah. And he keeps me up all night
watchin' stupid old movies.

136
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,663
My work's starting to suffer.

137
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,707
You install cable TV.

138
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,877
Joon, will you please glue your sequins?

139
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,049
Have we an internal sequin issue
to deal with, Benjamin?

140
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,552
All right, can we make this
the last hand?

141
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,391
Come on, come on. Play cards.

142
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,105
Two tickets,
tomorrow night's baseball game.

143
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,734
One Pocket Fisherman.

144
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,945
- Fold.
- Do you ever stay in?

145
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,702
Snorkel mask.

146
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,439
She knows how to rattle the day help.

147
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:16,860
I think we need to find someone
more understanding than Mrs. Smail.

148
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,904
Tell me, how are you two getting along?

149
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,990
Us?

150
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,076
Fine. Normal. You know, fine.

151
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,162
- Why?
- I'll level with you.

152
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,416
I think it's time you gave some
serious consideration to a group home.

153
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,588
- She already has a home.
- Benny, she'd be with her peers.

154
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:41,134
She hates her peers. She's quit
the two day centers to prove it.

155
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,012
Look, all we need right now
is a new housekeeper.

156
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,183
Well, I know of no one else.
You've been up and down the list.

157
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,436
You might want to consider that
there are some people

158
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,564
more capable of handling
these episodes than you.

159
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:01,696
I think that you two living together
may not be the best thing any more.

160
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,201
I'm her brother,
and I'm her only family.

161
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:10,622
And we've done just fine,
the two of us, for 12 years.

162
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:16,628
Yes, but her stress level is always
a factor in her display of symptoms.

163
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,964
Her agitation should
be kept to a minimum.

164
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,259
Everybody gets agitated.
Sometimes it's the only option.

165
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,762
Benny, don't get me wrong.

166
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,223
I'm impressed how
you've managed this long.

167
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,977
But a group home would let her
develop other relationships.

168
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:37,148
We don't know this,
but what if she were capable of a job?

169
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,776
They'd encourage her in that direction.

170
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:44,614
These are very nice places...
nurturing, supportive.

171
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,866
I'm not farming her out.

172
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,477
I have every right to be outside,
Officer.

173
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,729
- I have every right.
- Yes, ma'am.

174
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,023
May I see some ID, please?

175
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,164
Waldo, did you start
that brake job yet?

176
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,459
Joon called.
You've run out of tapioca.

177
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,171
- She what?
- Oh, and the police will corroborate.

178
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,342
Holy shit.

179
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,681
Listen, Jack, you wanna go
to the baseball game tonight?

180
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,142
- Hey, thanks, Benny.
- Box seats.

181
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,772
Hello? Joon?

182
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,082
Time for your medicine, Joon.

183
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,312
Good night, Steve.

184
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:36,285
- Hello. How's it goin'?
- I appreciate the deal on the engine.

185
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,748
- No problem. Is it runnin' all right?
- Yeah, it's running great.

186
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,459
- Good.
- So... can I...

187
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,129
Can I make it up to you
with some dinner?

188
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,007
Some dinner? Uh...

189
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,844
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Dinner with you.

190
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,558
You know what? I can't.

191
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,060
- I mean, I'd like to...
- It's OK.

192
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,312
OK.

193
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,027
Stupid. Stupid.

194
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,043
- 18-15.
- 17-16.

195
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,712
- 18-15!
- It caught the corner.

196
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,090
- It was a foot off the table.
- It was not.

197
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,301
- Juniper...
- Benjamin...

198
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,971
Don't underestimate the mentally ill.
We know how to count.

199
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:42,310
- OK, fine. 17-16.
- You can't give me what was mine.

200
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,729
- You're trying to cheat.
- I'm not.

201
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,982
- You're cheating.
- Joon, you're the one who's cheating.

202
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,359
You're all trying to cheat me.
You're trying to cheat.

203
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,754
Yeah. I spoke to some of the guys
on the staff, Benny.

204
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,090
Nobody wants to be a housekeeper.

205
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:19,305
I will. I'll keep tryin'. But I gotta
tell you honestly, I don't think so.

206
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,141
Yeah. OK. Thanks.

207
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,393
Bye.

208
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,186
OK, Stevie.

209
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,678
I mean, I can't even keep a goldfish
alive. What chance do I have with Joon?

210
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,098
If somethin' bad happened to her, I'd...

211
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,228
I'd never ever be able
to forgive myself.

212
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,356
A group home
is the right thing for her, Benny.

213
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,526
Yeah. This is definitely
for her own good.

214
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,198
Hey, it's for both your own good.

215
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,534
How much longer
can you do this to yourself?

216
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,204
Your life is literally passing you by.

217
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,957
You're right.

218
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,003
You're right.
What am I doing with myself?

219
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,592
I spend my life workin' on cars
and takin' care of my sister.

220
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,595
I can't have a relationship
without havin' to worry

221
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,139
about how Joon is gonna fit in.

222
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,851
Once she gets settled in,
you could actually take a vacation.

223
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,562
Travel a little.
I can hold down the fort.

224
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,317
Travel?

225
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,403
Benny, there's
a whole world out there.

226
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,240
I mean, picture yourself
on the open road.

227
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,909
Wind in the hair in the El Camino.

228
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,370
Highway stretchin' out...

229
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,622
What's that, up ahead?

230
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,667
A lovely motorist, stranded.

231
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,920
Carburetor trouble. Better investigate.

232
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,298
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna be stoppin' every 15 minutes

233
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,884
to call Joon to see how she's doin'.

234
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:08,140
OK, let's see.
Black Sabbath, over there.

235
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,602
- Is that a flashlight?
- It's a brush kind of a thing.

236
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,729
Here's a hat.

237
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,774
- Where's the batteries?
- You didn't win batteries.

238
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,152
- Those are mine.
- OK. Hey, guys, hurry it up!

239
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,780
Or we'll start without you.

240
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,074
I've been known to play a little cards.

241
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,930
Box of 30-aught-6 cartridges.

242
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,104
Medium-sized, green-haired troll.

243
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,482
Soap-on-a-rope, slightly used.

244
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,446
- Cards?
- Three.

245
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,574
- Cards?
- Two.

246
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,618
And the dealer takes...

247
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,413
three.

248
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,418
Pass.

249
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,631
Re-grout my shower. Blue grout.

250
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,509
I fold.

251
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,389
Shampoo my dog.

252
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,059
Lava lamp.

253
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,938
Paint the exterior of my house.

254
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,191
Hey, come on, slow down.

255
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,193
This is supposed
to be reasonable stakes.

256
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:46,072
That's a see and a raise. You follow me?

257
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:56,123
- You take my cousin off my hands.
- Wait, wait, wait. Just stop.

258
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,127
- Benny's gonna strangle you guys.
- Chill out, Thomas.

259
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,508
- Joon, we gotta go.
- Flush!

260
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,640
Full house.

261
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,476
Yes. Yes!

262
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:19,980
- Benny, tonight's your lucky night.
- Mike warned her it was for keeps.

263
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,483
What? What was for keeps?

264
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,486
I lost.

265
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:30,658
- What's in the pot?
- A cousin.

266
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,649
Rules are rules. Without 'em
there's no order in the universe.

267
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,861
Don't you give me that crap.
You took advantage.

268
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:11,615
Of your sick sister. A heart flush
is a perfectly respectable hand.

269
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,452
- Not respectable enough.
- Hey, shut up, Mike.

270
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:18,205
I am not takin' this guy home.

271
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,208
You have to! Remember
the bet I lost last year?

272
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,503
When I had to re-plate your socket set,
I didn't back out.

273
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,048
You can't bet a human being!

274
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,968
Oh, well,
if you're gonna be a baby about it...

275
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:35,222
All right, Mike.
You wanna play like that? I'll take him.

276
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:41,228
I may not be responsible for what
I'm gonna do to him, but I'll take him.

277
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,697
Oh, man.

278
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,912
- What are you doin', you jerk?
- Somethin' wrong with your car.

279
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,165
- What'd you do with my hubcaps?
- I don't know.

280
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,215
- I'm Sam.
- So I hear.

281
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,592
I'm Benny.

282
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,138
With an n?

283
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,933
Yeah. Two of 'em.

284
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,604
- This is Joon.
- With an n?

285
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,190
One.

286
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,986
You're out of your tree.

287
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,781
It's not my tree.

288
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,952
I think I need a beer.

289
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:44,583
Hey, Benny, wait a minute! Where are you
going? Come here! Gimme a jump! Hey!

290
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,097
You're goin' with them.

291
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,362
Oh! God bless you.

292
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,651
Hey, pal, we're tryin' to work here,
if you don't mind.

293
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,403
Oh, my God!

294
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,657
"I've been looking
for my boyfriend. Have you seen him?"

295
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,034
"He's a cute guy with a
little mole on his right cheek. "

296
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,161
Ruthie, a ghost come back to haunt you?

297
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,749
"Oh, Brad! Oh, Brad!
Brad, please don't be dead!"

298
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,920
"I never got a chance to tell you what
you meant to me. Oh, Brad, please!"

299
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,255
It's you, Ruthie Mallenek,

300
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,925
co-star of The Prom Queen Mutilator
with Dick Beebee.

301
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:00,636
- You saw that?
- "He was mine!"

302
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,429
"He was mine!"

303
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,933
"No. Cindy,
you're sick. You need help!"

304
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,144
"No, Cindy! No! No!"

305
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,438
"No!"

306
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,671
Don't... Don't touch it.

307
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,007
It's paint.

308
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,341
Yes.

309
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,684
Kirk Douglas. Van Gogh. Ear.

310
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,692
These are yours.
You can sleep here. All right?

311
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,905
It's late.
Let's brush your teeth and hair.

312
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,782
Grrr!

313
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,660
- I can brush my own teeth, Benjamin.
- Fine.

314
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,829
- Hair, too.
- Perfect.

315
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,040
Come on.

316
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,213
Oh! Oh, Benny.

317
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,006
Hey, Benny.

318
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:05,511
Thanks for the couch.
Mike made me sleep under the sink.

319
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:09,097
Oh. You're welcome.

320
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,350
- Good night.
- Good night.

321
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,472
Mentally ill.

322
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,977
- Really?
- Yeah.

323
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,521
But, I mean, don't worry about it.

324
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:44,359
But just let her go about her routine.
Her routine is everything to her.

325
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,988
Oh, and don't hang around her room
while she's painting.

326
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,198
- She hates that.
- No.

327
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,285
If she runs hot and cold on you,
just ignore it.

328
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,078
That's just the way it works.

329
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:02,169
Listen, if she starts
talkin' to herself,

330
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,630
don't worry about it, but don't answer.

331
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,423
OK.

332
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:11,762
She sometimes hears voices in her head.
That comes with the territory, too.

333
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:17,893
And... just make sure that nothin',
and you know I mean nothin',

334
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,687
happens to her.

335
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,732
OK.

336
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,069
OK. All right.

337
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,348
Having a Boo Radley moment, are we?

338
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,618
- Morning.
- Hey.

339
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,996
- This today?
- Yeah.

340
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,418
So... what'd you do with the cousin?

341
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,131
The bus station? The river?
What? You throw him in the river?

342
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,260
- No, I took him home.
- You took him home?

343
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,970
- Yeah.
- To your house?

344
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,474
- Yeah, to my house.
- What, are you crazy?

345
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,726
Hey, believe me, it's only temporary.

346
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:27,147
Great. Hey, maybe he can tell Joon
about the group home, huh?

347
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,192
If I'm gonna do this group-home thing,

348
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,487
I gotta figure out
the best way to tell her.

349
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,655
Where's Waldo? Is he not here yet?

350
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,990
No.

351
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,534
That's it.
I'm gonna have a talk with him.

352
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,788
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am. What's his phone number?

353
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,957

Where's Sam?

I didn't kick him out, he just left.

And I just kept seeing...

375
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,183

What did he... What did he do?

378
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,693
He cleaned the house.

379
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,499
And you kicked him out for that?

380
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,030
Maybe I should invite him back in.

381
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:10,161
Yeah. Before someone sticks a stamp
on his head and mails him to Guam.

382
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,469
Some cultures...

383
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,764
are defined by their
relationship to cheese.

00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,434
Is that a fact?

385
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,617
He can really cook, can't he?

386
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,788
Yeah.

387
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:38,583
Although, for grilled cheese,
I might've used the wool setting.

388
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,794
That's what I told him.

389
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,298
Really?

390
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,135
- What did he use?
- Rayon.

391
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,222
Silk would've been too soggy.

392
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,849
- Cotton would've...
- Would've burned it.

393
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,519
Right.

394
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,647
Fortunately he consulted me
before giving it steam.

395
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,649
I was against it.

396
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,784

I didn't know I could talk like that.

00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,431
Oh. Yeah.

- OK.
- Thank you, Ruthie.

You're welcome, Sam.
Let me know if you need anything, OK?

You don't like raisins?

00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,834
- Not really.
- Why?

421
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,089
They used to be...

422
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,884
fat and juicy.

423
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,554
And now they're twisted.
They had their lives stolen.

424
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:08,227
They taste sweet, but really
they're just humiliated grapes.

425
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:13,566
I can't say I'm a big supporter
of the raisin council.

426
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:19,530
Did you see those raisins on TV?
The ones that sing and dance and stuff?

427
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,241
- They scare me.
- Yeah. Me, too.

428
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:26,746
It's sick. They make them sing
and dance so people will eat them.

It's a shame about raisins.

430
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,044
- Cannibals.
- Yeah.

431
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,550
Do you like avocados?

432
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,761

- Thank you. Maybe I should quit my job.
- Where the hell have you two been?

438
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,555
Don't worry. They were with me,
running some errands.

- Hi.

Yes, I did. I ran an errand.

Come on in. Come on in.

446
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,459
- So why'd you leave?
- LA?

447
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,627
I wasn't that good of an actress.

448
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,172
Well, that's not how Sam tells it.

449
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:01,132
He's ravin' about you.

450
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,676
Well, he's sweeter
than he is judgmental.

451
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,516
How long have you known him?

452
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,854
Sam? Uh... 72 hours.

453
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,023
- Be serious.
- I am serious.

454
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,692
- Really?
- I'm always serious.

455
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,570
I'm too serious.

456
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:33,080

Brad? Brad?

458
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,427
Quit kidding around.
This isn't funny any more.

459
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,473
Can we turn this off?
Can we just turn this off?

460
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,225
No!

461
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,019

463
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:00,358
Why did you do this? You're sick.

464
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,735
You need help.

465
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,905
Let me... Don't!

466
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:09,742
He was mine. He was mine!

467
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,578
And if I can't have him, no one can.

468
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:17,750
Not even you.
You didn't have to buy that same dress.

469
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,253
But you are my sister, Cindy.

470
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,046
I'm sorry about me and Brad.

471
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,006
We didn't mean to fall in
love at the party.

472
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,092
It just happened.

473
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:30,638
Let's just forget it. There'll be
other boys, other midnight swims,

474
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,932
other prom dresses.

475
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,227
No! No, Cindy!

476
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,741
Try it again.

477
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,625
There's only two reasons
a car won't start:

478
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:03,462
Either you're not gettin' fuel
or you're not gettin' fire.

479
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,047
You've got fire.

480
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,384
I think you'd better
let me drive you home.

481
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,556
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

482
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,156
Here it is. It's right here.

483
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,325
- Second job, huh?
- Yeah.

484
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,869
Gotta make those ends meet, you know.

485
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,294
This is just how I imagined your place.

486
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,506
- Well...
- You wanna come in?

487
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,300
Or you wanna...

488
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,844
Oh. No.

489
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,513
I'll come in. For a minute.

490
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,059
Whoa! What is this?

491
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,397
- Nice porch.
- Pretty nice fish Joon gave you.

492
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,566
Oh, yeah. Those fish.

493
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,277
Yeah, I was shocked. I was...

494
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,614
- Nice fish. I mean, yeah...
- I never had a fish.

495
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,824
What? Not even as a kid?

496
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:18,788
No. Underprivileged childhood, I guess.

497
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,624
- Downright un-American, if you ask me.
- Yeah.

498
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,501
You can have one of mine, if you want.

499
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:27,046
No, I couldn't possibly.
They were a gift.

500
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:30,132
But we could share it.
Like joint custody.

501
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,301
You could take it on the weekends.

502
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,805
What is this?

503
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,225
Sit down, son.
You're makin' me nervous.

504
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,449
- Wanna beer?
- Yeah.

505
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,580
You know what? I better not.

506
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:04,667
I gotta get goin'.
I better get goin', OK?

507
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,961
Yeah.

508
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,755
- OK.
- I'll take a rain check on the beer.

509
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,008
I got the doors.

510
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,760
- Wanna go to dinner?
- Ever been married?

511
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,929
- No.
- Yeah.

512
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,223
Yeah?

513
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,100
Great.

514
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,352
- See ya.
- See ya.

515
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:24,854
See ya.

516
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,104
- See you next week.
- Right. Thank you.

517
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,773
Benny, would you
come inside a moment?

518
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,025
Sure.

519
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:44,076
- Who's the new housekeeper?
- The new...

520
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,245
Oh! This...

521
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,748
friend just came to stay
with us for a while, but...

522
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,001
Joon tells me he's a man.

523
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,922
Well, you know Joon,
how flowery she gets with words.

524
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,759
So she's lying?
I mean, is it a man or isn't it?

525
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,471
Well... Yes, technically.

526
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,600
He's really just a guy, a friend.

527
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,768
Where does this leave the group home?

528
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,104
I take it you haven't
talked to her about it.

529
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,649
No, not yet.

530
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,236
The admission date
is less than a week away.

531
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:23,282
But the thing is, she's really
doin' fine. She seems content.

532
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,910
Let's just leave it at that for now.

533
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,330
Let me know when you want to
tell her about it.

534
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,415
I'll let you know.

535
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,667
OK. Bye.

536
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,475

- No. No, it's OK.
- No, I really...

- How's my car?
- It's runnin' great.

637

639
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:37,904
I'll tell you what.
Give me $30 for the part.

640

- OK?
- Thanks.

642

Listen, if you're not
doin' anything later,

643
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,664
I just lined up this thing for Sam.

644
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,959
- What thing?
- It's kinda like an audition.

645
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:54,587
Maybe his chance to make a living
at all this crazy stuff he does.

646
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:59,050
Who knows? Maybe he could travel,
play clubs. I don't know, you know.

647
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:02,011
So if you're not
doin' anything later and...

648
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:05,890
I don't know, Benny. I got food
to deliver, apartments to rent...

649
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:08,810
My life's pretty complicated
right now. You know?

650
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,940
Thanks. Bye.

651
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:21,030
We'll lay out the whole routine
right after dinner.

652
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,243
You know what you could start with?
Remember the roll thing in the diner?

653

654
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:32,000
What is your problem? This is his chance
to do somethin', be somebody.

655
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,753
- He is somebody.
- Yeah, I know, but he wants to be more.

656
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,216
You don't know what he wants.

657
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:44,679
I know he doesn't want to be
a housekeeper for the rest of his life.

658
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:49,267
If you're worried about a new Smail,
don't worry, we'll get a new Smail.

659
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,688
He's not my Smail.

660
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,066
Housekeeper, whatever.

661
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,412
We have to tell him.

662
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,377
What?

663
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,256
Tell me what?

664
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,224

665
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:34,771

666
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,023
and I...

667
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,360
are... you know.

668
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,334
Bullshit.

669
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:04,092
You...

670
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,182
- Don't!
- Get the fuck out.

671
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,940
You can't throw him out. I won him.

672
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,317
You just settle down. Just settle down.

673
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,653
- I love him!
- Yeah?

674
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:25,905
Well, you are crazy!

675
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,367
I am not crazy.

676
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:34,289
You see what we've come to? You see?

677
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:44,257
I hate you!

678
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:53,599
I hate you. I hate you.

679
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:00,064
I hate you.

680
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:21,169
Can I get you anything?

681
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:27,508
- Tapioca.
- Tapioca?

682
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:31,262
- OK.

683
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,514
Anything on it?

684
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:37,560
Raisins.

685
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,272
OK.

686
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:53,302
Hi.

687
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,677
- Hi. How you doin'?
- You're out late.

688
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,888
Yeah.

689
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:40,099
Listen.

690
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:42,727
Do you have any tapioca?

691
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,147
Jeez, I've heard a
lot of lines in my life...

692
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,192
No, no, no, it's not for me. It's...

693
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:53,237
It's for Joon.

694
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:58,409
- Come on in.
- Yeah?

695
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,298
Joon...

696
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,968
OK?

697
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:59,262
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

698
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,322
I'm not. No, no, I'm not.

699
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,833
OK? All right?

700
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:33,671
Shh...

701
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:38,175
Hold tight. OK. Shh. It's OK.

702
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:41,762
It's OK.

703
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:49,854
I am not! I am not! I am not!

704
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:51,981
I am not!

705
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:01,949
- Agh!
- Shh, shh. Calm down.

706
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,578
Shut up!

707
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:10,041
No, no. No, no.

708
01:17:10,208 --> 01:17:12,001
Please...

709
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:25,848
- Joon, please, come on.
- No, it's not all in my head.

710
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,526
Sir? Sir!

711
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:39,862
Stop the bus, please!

712
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:43,616
Please stop the bus!

713
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:11,769
No!

714
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,563
Joon.

715
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:28,119
- All righty. You wanna step out?
- Yeah, OK. Yeah, OK.

716
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:31,747
- How you doin', hon?
- You think I don't know who you are?

717
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:33,958
I know just who you are!

718
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:37,128
So just leave. Leave.

719
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:38,421
Leave!

720
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:40,798
My name's Shane.
I'm a paramedic in town here.

721
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:42,383
We're here to help you.

722
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:50,933
Don't you touch me! Don't touch me!

723
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:11,120
- Joon? Joon!
- Sir, stay back.

724
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:43,569
Look, I am going to see my sister. Would
you please just tell me her room number?

725
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:48,783
- Please, just come back in the morning.
- Let me talk to her goddamn doctor!

726
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,329
I'm sorry.
She doesn't want any visitors.

727
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:55,915
Not you or anyone else.

728
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,542
She doesn't wanna see me?

729
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:00,878
No.
And she doesn't want to leave.

730
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:07,051
Benny, why don't you go home?
Get some sleep.

731
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,304
I promise I'll keep in touch.

732
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,786
I hope you're happy.

733
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:37,122
I hope you are happy with
what you have done to her.

734
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:42,586
You just stay the hell away
from my sister.

735
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:48,926
No.

736
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:52,054
Wanna know why
everyone laughs at you, Sam?

737
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,932
Because you're an idiot.

738
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,935
You're a first-class moron.

739
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:10,281
- You're scared, Benny.
- I'm what?

740
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:13,784
You're scared.

741
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:17,288
I can see it. And I know why.

742
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,501
I used to look up to you.

743
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:25,754
But, uh...

744
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:28,048
now I can't look at you at all.

- Who was that woman in, uh, Roman...

760

- Audrey Hepburn.
- Yeah. Sam, thanks a lot.

761
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:43,058
Have a nice day.

762
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:55,446
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I hope so.

763
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:02,619
- Hi, Benny.
- Thomas.

764
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:06,331
How is she? Tell me the truth.

765
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:10,753
- She's been better, Benny.
- You gotta tell me what room she's in.

766
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:16,467
335. But don't even think about it,
Benny. It's a closed ward. No visitors.

767
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:22,181
- No, we've gotta find Joon. Please.
- Thomas, get us in there to see her.

768
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:27,186
- It's impossible, Benny.
- What do you mean, it's impossible?

769
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:29,980
Listen, I just need
two minutes with her.

770
01:24:30,148 --> 01:24:31,815
Benny, I'll get fired!

771
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:34,193
Thomas,

772
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,612
I'm beggin' you, as a friend.

773
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:41,533
I'd love to help you out, but Garvey's
gonna be in there to check on her soon.

774
01:24:41,701 --> 01:24:44,453
My hands are tied. My hands are tied!

775
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,963
What room did he say?

776
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:57,758
335.

777
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,166
Shit.

778
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:00,297
What are you doin'?

779
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:04,968
Mommy?

780
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:06,261
What are you doin' here?

781
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:07,971
I don't think you're
supposed to be here.

782
01:27:08,139 --> 01:27:10,474
What room did you come out of?

783
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,477
- Get the door.
- How'd he get past Security?

784
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:14,811
Hey, watch the door.

785
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,967
Joon.

786
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:49,513
Look, I know you want to be left alone.

787
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:53,183
But you do not belong in here.

788
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,353
Now,

789
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:00,649
how would you like to try
livin' in your own apartment?

790
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:08,782
- An apartment?
- Yeah.

791
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:12,869
There's an apartment
available in Ruthie's building.

792
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:16,540
You'd let me live in an apartment?

793
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:19,710
That's up to you.

794
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:24,047
I'm through makin'
those decisions for you.

795
01:28:30,596 --> 01:28:32,723
Listen, I...

796
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:37,519
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

797
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:41,898
And about Sam, I was wrong.
I was dead wrong.

798
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:46,737
- I scared him away.
- No, you didn't.

799
01:28:46,904 --> 01:28:48,447
He's here.

800
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:51,575
- He is not.
- He's here. He got me in here!

801
01:28:51,743 --> 01:28:54,578
- He's somewhere in the building.
- He is not.

802
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,914
You'd never let me have him.

803
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:02,044
God.

804
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:06,590
Why do you hate me so much?

805
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:10,761
I don't hate you.

806
01:29:11,637 --> 01:29:13,764
You need me to be sick.

807
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,107
Juniper Pearl's chart, please.

808
01:29:27,987 --> 01:29:29,112
Thank you.

809
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:35,369
Hey, wait! Wally! Wait! Wait!

810
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:38,580
Put him down! He's mine.
I've been lookin' for him.

811
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:41,500
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll take care of him.

812
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:46,296
- Sam, you can't be in here.
- Where's Joon's room?

813
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:49,549
- I've gotta see her.
- Come on, come on.

814
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:06,566
Give me a reason why
I shouldn't have you arrested.

815
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,821
- It's that one.
- Yeah.

816
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:12,531
- See?
- OK.

817
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:14,157
Sam, where you goin'?

818
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:18,495
Benny, this is exactly
what we were trying to avoid.

819
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:22,249
By now, Joon would be in a caring
and controlled environment.

820
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:25,836
Isn't it obvious now that
you two need some distance?

821
01:30:26,003 --> 01:30:28,338
Why don't we ask Joon what she wants?

822
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,468
Sam, what are you doin'?

823
01:30:36,472 --> 01:30:39,433
Hey, Sam, come on! Get down, right now!

824
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:42,227
I don't know exactly what I want.

825
01:30:44,355 --> 01:30:49,693
I do know... that I am tired of
everyone telling me what to do.

826
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,823
Sam, come on!

827
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:56,867
Don't touch that!

828
01:30:57,034 --> 01:30:59,202
Sam, leave that! I'm beggin' you!

829
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,289
Joon, we want what's best for you.

830
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:05,584
I know that.

831
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:16,636
I...

832
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:19,389
Sam, come down now!

833
01:31:21,559 --> 01:31:23,560
You're gonna get in trouble!

834
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:25,812
I think I want to try
living in my own apartment.

835
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:44,289
Hm... I don't know.

836
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,584
Sam, stop swinging!

837
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,049
But I'm willing to let you try.

838
01:31:56,761 --> 01:31:59,346
I'll prepare the papers for her release.

839
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,849
Thank you, Dr. Garvey.

840
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:08,188
Come down! Sam!

841
01:32:14,403 --> 01:32:16,488
- Are you OK?
- Ouch! Ouch!

842
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:37,968
I know.

843
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:40,971
Me, too.

844
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:44,975
I'm gonna check you out, OK?

845
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:51,898
OK.

846
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:25,283
Haven't we tried this before?

847
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:28,495
Yeah, but my life's
a lot less complicated now.

848
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:34,292
- Is Joon inside?
- Yeah.

849
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,586
OK.
