1
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,568
'Let's go, let's go.

2
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,275
Ready for them?

3
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,369
Rosie, open up.

4
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,173
Vamos. Afuera. Vamos.

5
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,285
Okay, let's go.

6
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,754
- Just give me five.
- What?

7
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,970
What do you want me to do?

8
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,472
Look, it's not my problem.

9
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,304
All I'm asking, Stevens,

10
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,970
is did the old man get seen to?

11
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,570
He was sweating and shaking
when I put him on the bus.

12
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,172
He said his arm felt numb.

13
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,240
Jesus Christ, Brogan.

14
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,582
Everything is
a humanitarian crisis with you.

15
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,851
You signed off on more
orders of recognizance

16
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,222
than the rest of your unit combined.

17
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,555
Don't give me that shit.

18
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,891
The man's about to have
a goddamn heart attack.

19
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,726
I want him seen to.

20
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,403
Here he is.

21
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,462
Your guy was given
a clean bill of health by Doc Sturgess.

22
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,701
He bused out three hours ago.
You happy now?

23
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,404
Yeah, I'm happy now.

24
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,463
Hey, Max, you're coming
on Wednesday, right?

25
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,129
For my dad's nationalization party?

26
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,297
Max, it's an important thing
in my culture

27
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,601
to make my father proud.

28
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,437
You know they've been
wanting to meet you.

29
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,500
I give you my word,
they're not as scary

30
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,739
as I made them out to be, okay?

31
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,180
You better do it before
they blow the lunch whistle.

32
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,741
All right, let's go, compadres. Let's do it.

33
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,014
Get down!

34
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:15,918
[shouting]

35
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,048
[shouting in Spanish]

36
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,894
[shouting continues]

37
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,747
- Over there.
- I got it. Sorry.

38
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,247
What you waiting for, Brogan?

39
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,588
A marriage proposal?

40
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,650
Come on.

41
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,218
Come on.

42
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,005
Hey, hey! Gene.

43
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,533
I got her. Thanks.

44
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,758
No, no, no.

45
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,022
No es posible.

46
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,676
Muy bonita. You get her number?

47
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,576
I smell an O. R.

48
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,415
Yeah, he's always giving
the pretty ones a pass,

49
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,820
sometimes even
the not-so-pretty ones.

50
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,619
- Oh!
- Okay?

51
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,058
Now knock it the fuck off.

52
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,022
?? [singing in Hebrew]

53
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,560
Okay, everybody say,
"Thank you, Mr. Kossef,

54
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,564
for singing that beautiful song."

55
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,260
[children]
Thank you, Mr. Kossef.

56
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,073
You know, that was actually
a pretty tough crowd.

57
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,544
Yeah.

58
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,706
Well, was I shit?

59
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,750
No, actually.

60
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,252
No, and for somebody
who just learned the song last night,

61
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,914
- I thought you did a very good job.
- Oh, good.

62
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,924
'Cause I had absolutely no idea

63
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,187
- what I was singing about.
- Yeah.

64
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,729
- Oh, you could tell?
- Yeah, and also,

65
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,095
please don't take this the wrong way,

66
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:52,194
but what kind of Jew gets
hired at a Jewish day school

67
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,262
who doesn't speak any Hebrew

68
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,831
or even really, like, know
the first thing about Judaism?

69
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,401
Well, I guess, the atheist kind.

70
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,708
Excuse me?

71
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,214
No, I'm sorry.

72
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,716
It's just-- I just needed a job.

73
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,879
And it was actually my manager's mom

74
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,083
- is the principal of the school.
- Ah.

75
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,285
[bell rings]

76
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,158
- You didn't completely suck.
- Oh, thank you.

77
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,906
I do not want you to say
a word about this to anyone.

78
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,912
I mean anyone.

79
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,948
It could be very serious
trouble for the school,

80
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,575
- and for me.
- No, I'm not gonna say anything.

81
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,983
I want you to know

82
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,113
I am only doing this
because of my son,

83
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,785
because he says to me, "Mom, Gavin
is going to be an important musician."

84
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,760
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

85
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:53,526
Otherwise, I wouldn't do anything like this.

86
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:02,506
Well, thank you. Thank you, Rachel.

87
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,635
Honestly, I can't thank you enough.

88
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,013
[door opens]

89
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,057
She'll be right along, ma'am.

90
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,619
Thank you.

91
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,801
[door opens]

92
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,841
Oh.

93
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,155
Mmm. Mmm.

94
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,657
Hold on just a second.

95
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,162
Would you like to draw?

96
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,664
Here you go, honey.

97
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,928
I have something else
for you this week, too.

98
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,170
Your teacher, Madame Ntende,

99
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,935
sent this to me in the mail.

100
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,239
She said that you lost it
right before you left

101
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,245
and that you were really sad.

102
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,543
And she found it a few weeks ago.

103
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,187
Honey, it's gonna be
a little while longer,

104
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:34,596
and we are working very hard
to find you a good mommy.

105
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,103
She won't ever replace
your real mommy,

106
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,331
but she will love you.

107
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:44,240
And I promise that she'll never leave you.

108
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,984
[Woman] The men
involved in this terrorist attack

109
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,987
have been vilified,
demonized, and condemned

110
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,920
by the Western world.

111
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:03,753
But we never want to talk
about the 9/1 1 Jihadists as real people.

112
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,263
The media and our leaders
are quick to label them

113
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,462
as terrorists and monsters
and murderers.

114
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,562
But shouldn't we try
to understand them as human beings?

115
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,106
Fuck, no.

116
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,607
[students talking at once]

117
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,940
Everybody calls them cowards

118
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,275
for murdering helpless passengers

119
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,407
and causing the deaths
of thousands of innocent lives.

120
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,542
- What would you call them?
- Hey.

121
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,814
[Man] It's the truth.

122
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,756
But cowards do not knowingly
sacrifice themselves

123
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,622
for a greater cause.

124
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,628
- I don't agree at all.
- The cause is to kill us?

125
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,459
[students talking at once]

126
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,556
You may not agree with their cause--

127
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,567
[male student]
I don't understand why she's up there.

128
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,502
But I do not believe their actions

129
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,335
were either cowardly or irrational.

130
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,466
You know you don't want
to hear this shit, Ms. B.

131
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,272
She's talking.

132
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:56,303
I feel that, like the oppressed
Palestinian people,

133
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,316
or the lraqi citizens

134
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,978
under occupation
in their own homeland,

135
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,521
that they found themselves without a voice.

136
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,022
Hey.

137
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,685
And that the only way for them to be heard

138
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,923
is to scream with the might of tons of steel

139
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,864
and thunderous jet engines
behind them upon impact.

140
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,663
Okay, okay.

141
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,603
Their voices were heard.

142
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,106
You may not like what they had to say

143
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,608
or how they got their message across,

144
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,975
but for the first time, we heard it.

145
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,809
We gotta listen to this shit?

146
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,042
- What we heard was a cry for justice.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

147
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,553
Okay, okay. Yes, thank you.

148
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,383
Hey, Ms. B., thank you.

149
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,787
I am-- I am not sure

150
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,883
that that was the point
of the assignment, Taslima,

151
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,623
but, uh, yes, it was
certainly thought-provoking.

152
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,597
- [male student] Bullshit.
- Yeah, bullshit.

153
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,689
You can sit down now.

154
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,961
College is hungry for her.

155
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,331
Fucking traitor.

156
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,926
Crybaby.

157
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,562
Why don't you get
the fuck out of our country

158
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,573
and go back to camel-humping
Saudi Arabia,

159
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,337
- where the fuck you camel-humpers live.
- Brian. Brian.

160
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,843
- [laughter]
- I know you're upset,

161
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,540
but I'm not going to condone
an outburst like that.

162
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,641
[female student]
Yo, what's your name? Taslima bin Laden?

163
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,050
Hey, yo, I just got one question, Ms. B.

164
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,678
Did you frisk her? What if the bitch

165
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,246
be strapped with dynamite
or TNT or something?

166
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,087
- She going to get a grenade!
- [laughter, shouting]

167
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,151
- Yo, take us all out.
- Boom!

168
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,388
[Ms. B]
Marcus!

169
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,445
[woman laughs]

170
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,276
Sure, I'm up for that.

171
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,111
Oh, shit, it's my brother.

172
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,619
Hey.

173
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,382
I thought I told you not to come.

174
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,286
Javier's giving me a ride home.

175
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,915
It's on my way.

176
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,428
I just need five minutes to finish up.

177
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,191
I'm in the middle of an order.

178
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,198
Look at you. Cover yourself up.

179
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,133
Just go.

180
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,228
I'll meet you in the car.

181
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,772
Please.

182
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,112
- Um, Heavy-eye?
- Javier.

183
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,747
Hi, I'm Claire.
We spoke on the phone, remember?

184
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,451
Right. Yeah.

185
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,016
Okay.

186
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,554
Is that okay?

187
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,326
Yeah, it's good.
Come back on Friday.

188
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,835
Friday. Is that the soonest?

189
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,302
Yeah.

190
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,807
Okay. See you Friday. Okay.

191

195
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,254
He's lying. I did it last night.

197
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,301

?? [rap]

199
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:19,410
Oh, mama's boy taking out garbage.

200
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,112
Who made you the bitch of the family?

201
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,814
- You got no sister to do your grunt work?
- We take turn.

202
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,754
You gotta keep that shit
under control, motherfucker.

203
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:29,021
Tomo. Let's hit it.

204
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,597
Where to?

205
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,634
Damn.

206
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,671
Oh, shit, I got this little Glock, homie.

207
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:43,037
Okay, check it out.
Wan's uncle's into him for 50 large.

208
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,541
Pays out on Saturdays,
gets the cash in the store

209
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,545
Friday night right before closing.

210
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,411
We're gonna roll by and scope it out.

211
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,915
Yeah, you the bitch.

212
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,781
Give Yong the Ruger. Sweet gat, yo.

213
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,013
Tell me this don't make
your little chachi hard.

214
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,147
- Pussy.
- Yong, you're gonna pop your cherry, fool.

215
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,316
- That's right.
- You up for that, Yong?

216
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,950
Better be, homie.

217
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,899
[growling]

218
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,231
[Man] By sunbathing,
crocodiles accelerate

219
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,736
the chemical reactions in their bodies.

220
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,240
Once the croc is up to speed...

221
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,405
[meow]

222
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,655
[TV playing]

223
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,732
No, I don't know her name.

224
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,608
I'll recognize her when I see her.

225
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,505
Yes. Andasol Fabrics.

226
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,952
I'm gonna come down
and have her released on an O.R.

227
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,287
She's got a minor child left unattended.

228
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,692
Are you sure?

229
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,564
How long ago did they bus out?

230
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,068
Wait, wait, wait.

231
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,833
Did anybody from
Children's Services see her?

232
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,866
Yeah. Okay.

233
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,376
Thank you.

234
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,503
[phone beeps]

235
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,615
Fuck it.

236

[car door shuts]

00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,401
[sniffs]

238
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,922
?...in a man with angry rules ?

239
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,966
? It's that bitter pill can make you kill ?

240
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,026
? It don't put me in the mood ?

241
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,595
? So don't talk to yourself ?

242
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,664
? But don't talk to me ?

243
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,774
? There's a river running through it ?

244
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,680
? The devil's not my enemy ?

245
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,718
? So don't talk to yourself ?

246
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,687
? But don't talk to me ?

247
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:47,384
? If there's poison in the maker ?

248
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,019
? Don't mistake the ?

249
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:54,930
? Enemy ?

250
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,524
Whoo!

251
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,035
Whoo!

252
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,901
That was great.

253
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,940
Thank you. I'm done.

254
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,601
Glad you came.
So how was your class?

255
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,166
What?

256
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,110
I got a recurring role on The D'Angelos.

257
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,273
- You got a part? Are you serious?
- Bitch.

258
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,715
- You did? You got a part?
- I know, it's unbelievable.

259
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,252
Oh, fuck. That's a big deal, babe.
It's big news.

260
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,685
- Yeah.
- We should get a drink.

261
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:17,779
I'll get it.

262
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,556
Thanks, babe.

263
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,891
So how did you pull it off?

264
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,795
I don't know. The casting director
knows my situation.

265
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:30,858
She's given me until Friday
to get my l-9 in.

266
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,599
So there's a fellow I met
through someone at Crunch.

267
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,164
He works at one of those photocopying
stores on Fountain.

268
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,574
Come on, no, no,no.
You can't do that.

269
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,409
If you get caught
with a fake green card,

270
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,449
you could be done for fraud.

271
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,609
It's no different from photoshopping
your Social Security card

272
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,983
to remove the "Not
for Employment" stamp.

273
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,386
Or passing yourself off
as a religious Jew

274
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,083
when you're an atheist,
like, an actual atheist.

275
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,752
- Come home with me.
- What?

276
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,488
I'm serious. Come home with me.

277
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,259
It's not practical. You know that.

278
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,098
You know we can't make a go
of it without status.

279
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,137
I've gotta get legal, and so do you.

280
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,968
You've got to get legal.
You know that.

281
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,439
I'm working on that, all right?

282
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,702
I just want to know
where this guy is.

283
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,006
Your Captain America
who's gonna come down

284
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,443
he's gonna sweep you off your feet,

285
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,242
he's gonna marry you,
he's gonna make you legit.

286
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,044
- lsn't that what you're looking for?
- Captain America?

287
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,641
I just wonder what's taking you so long.

288
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,448
Here you go.

289
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,747
Thanks, babe.

290
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,883
Yeah, listen, I gotta go.

291
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,985
I gotta go. It was a real pleasure
meeting you--

292
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,654
- Rose.
- Rose.

293
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,665
Yeah, just give me an email
when your TV thing comes out.

294
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,429
Gavin, I'll see you...

295
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,936
before. You know?

296
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,200
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

297
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,542

[woman speaking Spanish]

299
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,981
She owes me money for the week.

300
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,527
What are you doing,
negotiating with me?

301
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:40,554
Is that what you think you're doing?

302
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,896
How much?

303
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,027
$50.

304
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,233
[bills rustle]

305
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:58,546
If it's not the right kid, I'm coming back.

306
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,812
[speaking Spanish]

307
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,031
What's his name?

308
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,533
Juan.

309
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,798
Juan Sanchez.

310
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,549
Thanks, pal.

311
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,171
[woman speaking Spanish]

312
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:10,077
I need a reverse l.D.
on a Tijuana number.

313
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,588
Let's see.

314
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:17,151
It is 661-555-7782.

315
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,328
Appreciate it.

316
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,938
Oh, I think it's this
goddamn stomach flu that's going around.

317
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,944
I've been throwing up all morning.

318
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:37,209
Well, let them know
I'll call in later tomorrow.

319
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,250
[sighs]

320
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,086
Okay, let's go.

321
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:06,076
Uh, I'm not finding any record
of your l-539 in our system.

322
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,009
You said you sent it in six weeks ago?

323
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,137
Eight. Eight weeks ago.

324
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,774
Okay. Well, do you
have a mailing receipt?

325
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,251
No, because I just copied
my l-94 and sent it by regular mail.

326
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,187
Okay, well, then how about a cancelled
check for the application fee?

327
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,417
Um, well, I paid by money order.

328
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,323
I don't have a checkbook.

329
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,419
I didn't get a receipt
for my money order.

330
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,521
Listen, I'm starting to get
a little concerned here--

331
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,066
Ma'am, you are not out of status

332
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,592
until you receive a decision
on your extension application.

333
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,105
However, if that application
is lost in the system

334
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,232
or for whatever reason
it doesn't get to us,

335
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,867
then how are we supposed to know

336
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,935
that you even sent it in in the first place?

337
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:44,175
From our perspective, with no mailing receipt
or cancelled money order,

338
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,012
you're out of status, unless--

339
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,985
My application just turns up.

340
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,328

[tires screech]

342
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,100
Son of a bitch.

343
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,203
Fuck. It's a brand-new fucking car.

344
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,810
Sorry, didn't l--

345
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,816
I didn't have time to stop.
You just shot out like that.

346
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,047
- I signaled, didn't l?
- No, and even if you did,

347
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,520
it's supposed to be clear
before you turn into the street.

348
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,580
You okay?

349
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,250
Yeah.

350
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,816
Yeah? You look dazed.

351
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,487
- No.
- Do you need to sit down?

352
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,621
Does it hurt anywhere?

353
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,686
- No, no, no, no, no.
- You sure?

354
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,255
Yeah, I'm all right, I think.

355
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,894
I've just had a really, really shitty day.

356
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,461
- Where you from, New Zealand?
- Australia.

357
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,905
It's always one or the other.

358
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,669
I can never quite tell the difference.

359
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,608
I said New Zealand to impress you
in case I was right.

360
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,839
Most people usually say Australia,

361
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,212
which upsets the Kiwis.

362
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,274
I don't have the money to pay for this.

363
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,285
I'm not insured on my car.

364
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,287
Ouch. That's not good.

365
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:00,290
I must have fucked someone over
really badly in a past life

366
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,349
because shit is just
piling up for me today.

367
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,486
I just spent the last
three hours in there

368
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,497
trying to convince some bureaucratic bitch

369
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,033
that I actually did file for an extension
on my visitor's visa.

370
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,625
Which I fucking did.

371
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,433
- What's your name?
- I'm sorry. I'm Claire Shepard.

372
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,666
Claire Shepard, I'm Cole Frankel,

373
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,901
- and I know of your frustrations.
- You do?

374
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,740
I'm a supervisory center
adjudications officer.

375
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,677
What that means is I get to determine

376
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:27,184
whether a green card
application has merit or not.

377
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,311
Ah, that must be interesting.

378
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,014
Yeah, I'll tell you what's interesting,

379
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,114
and what's of a bit of concern to me,

380
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,489
aside from you not having insurance,

381
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,085
and that's someone who's filing
for an extension of their visitor's visa

382
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,994
driving around with a stack
of head shots in her car.

383
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,125
There's nothing wrong
with a beautiful woman like yourself

384
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,398
having head shots in her car
if you were back in Australia.

385
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:51,465
You're not authorized to be seeking
employment in the United States, Claire.

386
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,512
Am I wrong about that?

387
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,570
All right, here's what I propose.

388
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,946
We call AAA-- my card, of course.

389
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,508
If you don't have insurance,
you sure as hell don't have AAA.

390
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,417
Then we get your vehicle sorted out.

391
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:06,355
Then we go grab some lunch together.

392
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,857
Excuse me?

393
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,293
I want to buy you lunch, Claire,
and explain your options to you.

394
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,661
or we could just take a walk
back into the building

395
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,359
and sort it out there.

396
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,048
Juanito! Juanito!

397
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,613
Juanito! Juanito!

398
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,989
[speaking Spanish]

399
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,994
[crying]

400
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,495
Gracias, Señor.

401
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,294
[speaking Spanish]

402
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,051
Sanchez. Mireya.

403
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,883
24.

404
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:21,324
It would be last night
or early this morning.

405
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:22,825
You positive?

406
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,421
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

407
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,927
That's a great show.

408
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,666
Nothing can touch that on TV.

409
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,834
I thought you said you wanted
to discuss my situation.

410
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,104
All right.

411
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,713
Here's the thing, Claire.

412
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,910
You want to be an actress
like Nicole and Naomi, obviously.

413
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,919
You know as well as I do

414
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,921
the work they do in Australia
doesn't count for shit.

415
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:55,085
They're stars because they
make movies here in America.

416
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,323
If you were to get deported,
or even chose voluntary departure,

417
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,988
you ain't getting back into this country

418
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,032
for a minimum of ten years.

419
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,831
And with voluntary departure,
they say it's closer to five,

420
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,236
but the truth is, you're lucky
if you ever get back in.

421
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,773
What's your wife do?

422
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,274
She works for the other side.

423
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:12,673
She's an immigration defense attorney.

424
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,008
Oh. Is she available for a consult?

425
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,240
[laughs]

426
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,806
That's funny.

427
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:23,843
Sexy, great sense of humor.
You got it all, Claire.

428
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,753
Except for a work permit.

429
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,315
I don't think you'll feel so witty

430
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,055
when they introduce you
to a holding cell down in San Pedro.

431
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,994
Strip-search, the whole bit.

432
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,727
Some mama Latina makes you
her bitch for a couple nights.

433
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:41,795
All right. You've made your point.

434
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,467
So where would you like to do it?

435
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,372
[Cole groaning]

436
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,377
[panting]

437
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,889
You're goddamn amazing.

438
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,092
Whew.

439
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,931
You really are...

440
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,836
a perfect little fuck machine.

441
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,430
[groans]

442
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,997
Without a green card.

443
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,274
Well, maybe we could
do something about that.

444
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,284
You can get me a green card?

445
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,912
I can't just manufacture one for you.

446
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:34,948
I'm not in the counterfeiting business.

447
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,927
But I can have your file and application,

448
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:41,454
which would conveniently
land on my desk,

449
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:45,628
and regardless of the merits
of that application,

450
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,898
it would be approved.

451
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,634
You could really pull that off?

452
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,938
Like, on what grounds?

453
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:56,412
You're a recognized TV star
in Australia, Claire.

454
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,642
I'm bloody well not. I'm not even close.

455
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,583
I don't know that.

456
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,951
And no one else does.

457
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,590
You fabricate some credits,

458
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,221
a few, uh, Aussie awards,

459
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,787
some bullshit testimonials.

460
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,595
And I make it fly.

461
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:17,965
It's called an EB-1.

462
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,698
It's a green card for persons
of extraordinary ability.

463
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,263
Are you jerking me around?

464
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,865
Or is this real?

465
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,910
Because if you can make
this happen for me--

466
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,174
You'd make it worth my while.

467
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,647
Mm-hmm.

468
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,980
For two weeks.

469
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,952
For a green card?

470
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,011
Six months, baby.

471
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:41,024
I don't think so.

472
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,889
One month.

473
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,326
Three months.

474
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,295
Two months

475
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:49,026
and you get me approved
up front, all right?

476
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,863
You can hold on to the paperwork,

477
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:51,993
but I want to see it.
I want to know that it's real.

478
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,503
Done.

479
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,869
But you're on the clock from tomorrow.

480
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,899
I call, and you get your ass over
to whatever address I give you.

481
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,637
All right.

482
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,048
So you through with me for the day?
Can I go grab a shower?

483
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,609
No, wait.

484
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:13,919
I got one more favor
to ask of you, Claire.

485
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,951
I want you down on all fours
at the edge of the bed.

486
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,490
[crying]

487
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,971
You ain't got that yet?

488
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,239
- You cheated today.
- Check it out, yo.

489
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,780
Wait, wait, wait.

490
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,543
- [car horn blows]
- You gonna talk to her, dude?

491
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,447
- Taslima. Taslima!
- Oh, God.

492
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,151
It's the sand-nigger express.

493
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,055
Raghead chick can hide her face
and nobody even know she butt-ugly.

494
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,252
Hey, maybe you can get
your sister to convert or something, A.Z.

495
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,988
Shut up.

496
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,131
[young man]
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff!

497
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,527
Put on your belt.

498
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,765
[Taslima's father] No.

499
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,883
[knock on door]

500
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,681
[Man] lmmigration Customs Enforcement. Open
the door.

501
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,989
[knocking]

502
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,687
What is this about?

503
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,458
Federal agents.
Open the door, please.

504
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,124
We have a warrant.

505
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:34,801
Hands against the wall, please.

506
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,430
Hands against the wall.

507
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,065
What is this?

508
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,632
Why is the FBl here?

509
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,440
Relax, sir. Put your
hands behind your back.

510
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,105
[handcuffs snap]

511
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,917
Are you Taslima Jahangir?

512
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,280
I'm Special Agent Phadkar.

513
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,518
Will you show me
to your bedroom, please?

514
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,694
I don't understand what this is about.

515
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,324
Did you write this?

516
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,800
Why do you have it?

517
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,133
It was brought to our attention
by the principal of your school.

518
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,298
He was troubled by the position you took.

519
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,342
I thought there was something
like freedom of speech in this country.

520
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,470
You essay elicits sympathy
for the 9/1 1 hijackers,

521
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,036
suggests you feel their cause was just.

522
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,639
That's not what I wrote.

523
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,184
I wrote that I understand
why they did what they did.

524
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,379
I didn't write that I support it.

525
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,218
Do you? Support their actions?

526
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:31,159
I understand their need to be heard.

527
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,322
I don't think they went
about it in the right way.

528
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,228
Agent Phadkar.

529
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,436
Do you have an interest in suicide?

530
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,978
Your diary suggests you do.

531
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,981
That's not--

532
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:58,616
Those are notes on a class paper
on why religions oppose suicide.

533
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,182
And you're not opposed to it?

534
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:05,252
I wouldn't become a suicide bomber,
if that's what you mean.

535
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,762
But you condone suicide bombing

536
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,696
as a legitimate means
to make a statement?

537
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,131
That's what you wrote in your essay.

538
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,034
You're twisting my words.
That's not what I wrote.

539
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,505
Well, reads that way to me.

540
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:19,407
"Upon impact, their voices
were finally heard.

541
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,536
"You may not like what they had to say

542
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,273
"or how they got
their message across,

543
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,874
"but we heard it.
For the first time, we heard it."

544
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,148
I was just saying that
they got our attention

545
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,451
and that maybe
we should understand

546
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,957
why they did what they did. That's all.

547
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,221
So if someone's pissed off at America,

548
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,763
they should hijack and fly planes
into our buildings.

549
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,491
That seems like
a reasonable thing to do.

550
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,662
Agent Phadkar, over here.

551
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,431
Take a look at this.

552
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,235
She has a World of lslam account.

553
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,436
She's been frequenting
some interesting chatrooms.

554
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,274
Global Jihad,

555
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,281
Jihad Talking Points.

556
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,783
I'm interested in all
Muslim points of view.

557
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,842
It keeps me informed.

558
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,516
Taslima, your parents are
in the United States illegally.

559
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:11,084
My brother and sister were born here.

560
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,459
They're American citizens.

561
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,725
True.

562
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,528
But you and your parents are not.

563
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,866
When your brother and sister
reach the age of 21,

564
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:23,464
they're entitled to petition
for your parents to enter this country.

565
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,873
Until then, your family has no status.

566
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,740
Listen to me, Taslima.

567
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,214
Here's what I'm willing to do for you.

568
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,774
I'm not interested
in detaining your family.

569
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,288
But I'd like to talk to you further.

570
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,722
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
has every right

571
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,986
to take your family into custody,

572
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,688
but if you leave with us now
and cooperate with us,

573
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,754
Immigration won't detain them.

574
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,629
They'll still have to resolve their status,

575
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,168
but nobody's looking to make
an issue of that right now.

576
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,466
You understand?

577
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,560
Mr. Max, welcome to my home.

578
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,502
- Thank you.
- You honor me with your presence tonight.

579
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,471
- Thank you.
- This is my wife.

580
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,064
Very nice to meet you. Welcome.

581
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,905
Thank you. You have a beautiful home.

582
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,410
Thank you.

583
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,469
Congratulations, sir, on your naturalization.

584
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,174
Thank you. Farid.

585
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,443
[speaking native language]

586
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,317
Come over here. Come and meet
an important gentleman.

587
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,787
- He's my youngest son. He's a lawyer.
- Ah.

588
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,881
- How are you?
- How do you do?

589
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:51,052
- It's a pleasure.
- Hi. How are you?

590
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:54,097
This is Max. He is the partner of Hamid.

591
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,861
You show him the respect,
or he will have you deported.

592
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,561
[laughter]

593
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,002
He can't deport me, Baba.
I've already been naturalized.

594
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,006
You're the only person in this house
who can be deported.

595
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,565
Until Saturday.
Then he becomes one of us.

596
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:06,940
[baby crying]

597
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,707
I'm gonna go put her down.
It was good to meet you.

598
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,179
- Thank you.
- Okay, come on.

599
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,773
[door closes]

600
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,218
Hey, Max, I'm so glad
you made it tonight.

601
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,880
I really appreciate it.

602
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,651
Get you a drink?

603
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,090
Yeah, Scotch rocks, please.

604
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,151
[speaking native language]

605
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,034
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

606
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,073
[Woman] lnside.

607
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,945
My sister should not
have come here tonight.

608
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,176
What's going on there?

609
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,515
She puts herself before the family.

610
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,522
She shouldn't expect
to be welcome around here.

611
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,820
Baba.

612
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,786
So, Max. Hamid speaks so highly of you.

613
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,163
He looks up to you.

614
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,032
Never understood why he joined the
immigration Gestapo.

615
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,468
I think that deep down inside

616
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,733
he doesn't feel like he belongs.

617
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,536
I mean, what better way
to prove you're red, white, and blue

618
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,601
than by throwing out those
who also don't belong?

619
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,441
You're a lawyer, huh?

620
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,744
I'm a junior partner
at Berkhof, Mazolo, and Klein.

621
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,716
Specialize in personal injury.

622
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:21,979
We have 35 lawyers under us.

623
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,282
You're an ambulance chaser.

624
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,619
I don't chase anyone.

625
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,180
I turn clients away.

626
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,592
Excuse me.

627
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,805
You have another one of those?

628
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:51,712
Max Brogan. I work with Hamid.

629
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,409
I know who you are.

630
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:02,984
Thank you.

631
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,960
What does that say on your bracelet?

632
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,222
"Little angel."

633
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,466
My father gave it to me when I was 12.

634
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,167
You realize that they're staring at us.

635
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:24,681
Very disapproving looks you're getting
for consorting with the outcast.

636
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:27,649
I'll risk it.

637
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,488
I've never been invited
to a shunning before.

638
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,992
What is this? Something you guys
brought over with you?

639
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,722
I didn't bring it.

640
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,923
I was born here.

641
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,126
I'm the only one in this family
who's an actual American.

642
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,568
Probably decided to naturalize.

643
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,005
Makes 'em every bit as American as you.

644
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,777
Let me tell you about my father.

645
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,975
The great American-to-be.

646
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,917
He was always critical of the Shah.

647
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,477
But after the revolution,

648
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:08,218
one of his business rivals spread rumors
that he was anti-Khomeini.

649
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:12,490
And the whole family
had to flee across the border to Turkey.

650
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:16,124
He spent most of his savings
trying to get everybody over here.

651
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,732
But see, he doesn't pine
for the days of the Shah.

652
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,400
And I think he'd be perfectly content

653
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:29,913
in that fucked-up lslamic shithole
that that country is today.

654
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,574
Which is why he resents
every day he spends here.

655
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,845
Well, he could go back.

656
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,784
He's too old to start over.

657
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,288
So what's your story?

658
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:40,823
Any family?

659
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,387
I have a daughter.

660
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,930
I'm not with her mother anymore.

661
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,057
How old is she?

662
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,396
26.

663
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,369
Uh...no.

664
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,406
27.

665
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:59,965
You better get that straight,
or you might piss her off.

666
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,035
I think I did that already.

667
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:07,305
Max, my father's asking for you.

668
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,144
It was nice meeting you, Max.

669
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,120
You, too.

670
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,282
I'm out of here.

671
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,690
[whispers]
Got a date.

672
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,024
Got a real hot date, Max.

673
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,726
Ignore her. She's crazy.

674
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,031
I'm tired, Hamid.

675
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,004
I'm gonna go home.

676
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,199
Max.

677
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,437
My father.

678
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:38,277
See you tomorrow.

679
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,510
Tell your family thanks for me, okay?

680
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,356
You know what she said

681
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,393
to the Yoruban interpreter today?

682
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,021
"Are you my mommy?"

683
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,462
The interpreter says

684
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,125
she's losing her ability
to speak the language.

685
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,863
It's 23 months
that she's been in there.

686
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,667
23 fucking months.

687
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,574
I feel gutted every time I go.

688
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,306
Ah, it's a shitty situation.

689
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,907
But you can't keep
beating yourself up over it.

690
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,153
I was thinking...

691
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,814
we could maybe adopt her.

692
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,318
D.

693
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,884
I'm serious.

694
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,590
Her mother's dying of AlDS in a hospice.

695
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,997
Leike's dad
back in Nigeria denies paternity

696
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,762
and won't accept custody of her.

697
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,632
We're working on it. One of our own.

698
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:37,003
And we can keep working on it.

699
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,167
I've thought about this a lot.

700
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,939
And it feels right.

701
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:45,038
It feels like it's meant to be.

702
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,515
You can't just lay this
on me and expect me to--

703
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,484
God.

704
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,233
Will you think about it?

705
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,495
It's important to me.

706
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,367
Please.

707
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah, I'll think about it.

708
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,703
Thank you.

709
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,811
- [speaking Hebrew]
- [repeating Hebrew]

710
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:34,757
[singing in Hebrew]

711
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,197
- I can't do this.
- Oh.

712
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:39,963
I haven't even spoken Hebrew
since my bar mitzvah, you know?

713
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,095
I didn't even know it then.

714
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,160
You know what?

715
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,036
You guys, you're all the same.

716
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,042
All of you. You're all reform at best.

717
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,772
Most of you haven't gone to Shul
since your bar mitzvahs.

718
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,110
But first thing you do when you come
over here is play the Jew card.

719
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,978
Haven't you got any shame?

720
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,847
- Ouch. That's pretty--
- [phone rings]

721
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,182
Oh. Hello?

722
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,916
Hey, Mum. Hey, hey, hey.
How are you doing?

723
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,548
Yeah, did you get my message?

724
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,957
Uh-huh. Yeah.

725
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:06,018
Well, what about the rabbi?

726
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,725
No, I need you to
get him to write a letter

727
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,132
Iike on the Temple's letterhead

728
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:16,366
saying, uh, that I attend services regularly.

729
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,499
Uh, I was bar mitzvahed by him.

730
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,975
And that I'm, you know,

731
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:24,639
I'm strongly committed
to the Jewish faith.

732
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:25,909
All right.

733
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,473
Well, listen,
I'm kind of busy right now.

734
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:28,950
But I'll get back to you, though.

735
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,008
And will you do that for me?

736
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,384
Yeah, you promise? Okay.

737
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,423
Listen, M-- Yeah.

738
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,514
I'll speak to you soon.

739
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,615
All right. I love you, too.

740
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,684
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye.

741
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:41,788
Ahh...

742
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:45,164
Iook, l-- I got to be home by 10, yeah?

743
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,226
So, um... [clears throat]

744
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,204
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

745
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,002
- With everything.
- Thank you.

746
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,838
Oh, what about if I just
kind of twiddled these--

747
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,003
these side bits here?

748
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,170
You think I'd get away with that?

749
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,908
If I just stick these out like that?

750
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,846
I can go all night with my wife,

751
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,013
but I'm like a teenager with you.

752
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,352
[groans]

753
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,297
Doesn't sound like you've gone all night
with her in a long while.

754
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:18,095
[scoffs]
It used to be hot between us.

755
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:23,401
One day, you're just
not into it anymore.

756
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:26,067
It becomes like an effort.

757
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,611
Easier to jerk yourself off in the shower

758
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,408
than to rub her back for half an hour.

759
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,471
Bloody sad.

760
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,915
Yeah, it is.

761
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,588
Maybe I'll come watch you
on the set next week.

762
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,894
That's not part of the deal.

763
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,088
It's not supposed to be.

764
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,290
I just thought I'd stop by and...

765
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,459
Um, I got to go.

766
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:56,495
I've got a meeting with an agent.

767
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,734
If she signs me, it's major.

768
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,103
I'll call you tomorrow.

769
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,685
[sighs]

770
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,097
[speaking Korean]

771
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,428
Denise Frankel.

772
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,327
- Hello.
- Hello.

773
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,160
Please, thank you
for helping my daughter.

774
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:32,429
Clearly, this is not
about her immigration status.

775
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,197
But they're using her lack of status

776
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:36,705
to get around normal criminal
and juvenile proceedings.

777
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,798
[speaking native language]

778
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,070
My wife wants to know
when we can see her.

779
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,611
I'm working on that.

780
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:48,712
I'm pushing for a one-on-one
with the FBl task force officer tomorrow.

781
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:55,052
Right now, your entire family
is at risk for removal.

782
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:58,094
I recommend you do not
go back to your apartment.

783
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,925
Do you have any friends or family
with whom you can stay?

784
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,408
Rosa.

785
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,879
Come on, Rosa.

786
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,745
Rosa. Rosa.

787
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:22,785
Can't find you, Rosa.

788
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,286
[beeps]

789
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:29,152
And another one bites the dust.

790
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,420
We do our best.

791
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:33,895
- [phone ringing]
- I'm sure you do, sir.

792
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,431
Yes.

793
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:36,659
Yes, this is him.

794
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,597
Who?

795
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,092
Hey, Hamid.

796
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,495
Hamid? Hey, Hamid.

797
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,396
Hey!

798
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,456
What's up?

799
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,969
I, uh-- It's my sister.

800
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,334
What's the matter?

801
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,744
Maybe you can help me.

802
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:39,195
Do you recognize him?

803
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:42,925
Agent Baraheri?

804
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,134
It's her boss,

805
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:53,335
from the print shop where she works.

806
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,140
We've got security video
from the motel

807
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:57,578
of an unidentified male perp

808
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,137
in a hooded sweatshirt
leaving the scene.

809
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:02,185
Time of death somewhere
between 1 1 and midnight.

810
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:08,180
Did you know that your sister
was having relations

811
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,852
with Mr. Bedraz,

812
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:13,862
who was married with two young kids?

813
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:18,367
I never talked to her

814
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,494
about the details of her private life, no.

815
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,832
Do you know of anyone

816
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:24,396
who may have had it in for her?

817
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,499
Jealous of her, perhaps?

818
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:31,377
Like I said, I didn't get into her life.

819
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,780
There's something else.

820
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,480
I found these while going through
Mr. Bedraz' jacket

821
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,749
Iooking for identification.

822
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,586
They come in sets of threes.

823
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,751
Green card, driver's license, social.

824
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,295
All counterfeit.

825
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:47,887
We found more of this stuff
at his apartment

826
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:49,727
earlier this afternoon.

827
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,266
As best we can figure,

828
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,632
he was cranking them out
after hours at the store.

829
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,500
We've referred that end of it

830
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,006
to your documented benefit
for our task force.

831
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:00,304
Think it might be Mexican mafia,

832
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:03,278
upset about him cutting into their action?

833
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:07,442
We're looking at a number
of possibilities right now.

834
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,213
When would be a good time to interview

835
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:13,984
your other family members,
Agent Baraheri?

836
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:16,685
Can I just--

837
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,753
I'd like to spend a moment
with my sister alone, please.

838
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,526
Of course.

839
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,034
Um...

840
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:27,660
I'm sorry for your loss.

841
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,711
I hate the fucking smell of that place.

842
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,457
I know you're judging me, Max.

843
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,992
What are you talking about?

844
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,692
My sister.

845
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,496
What you witnessed last night.

846
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,298
Now I'm mourning her.

847
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,134
You doubt the veracity of my heart.

848
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,504
I'm just sitting here
feeling your pain, my friend.

849
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,033
Feeling for your entire family.

850
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,841
It's a sad, terrible thing, your loss.

851
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:15,544
No way do I doubt
your love for your sister.

852
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:16,916
No way.

853
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,395
Well, if you need someone
to talk it through with...

854
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,987
Thank you.

855
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,250
Officially, she's being held

856
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:52,117
for an unlawful presence
in the United States.

857
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,884
Unofficially-- and I'll never repeat this
outside this room--

858
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,256
she's being detained
for presenting an imminent threat

859
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,318
to the security of the United States,

860
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,728
based upon evidence
that she planned to be a suicide bomber.

861
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,400
And what evidence would that be?

862
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,936
Don't play coy with me, counselor.

863
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,835
The signs are all there.

864
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,840
We're talking about
a devout Muslim young woman

865
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,206
who at 15 years of age
walks around veiled.

866
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:17,269
Who engages in internet talk
focused on the duty of Jihad.

867
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,315
And writes openly about suicide.

868
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:21,612
[chuckles]
Did you take a look at her bedroom?

869
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,619
How austere it was?

870
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,712
This isn't the life of a normal teenager.

871
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:27,120
Everything about her is a red flag.

872
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,023
Only when viewed through
the distorted looking glass

873
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,856
of your own paranoias.

874
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,418
I could joust with you all day,

875
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,964
but here's the reality of our situation.

876
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,762
She's illegal. She's removable.

877
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,861
And I intend to have lmmigration
and Customs Enforcement remove her

878
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,235
to ensure the safety
of the American people.

879
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,137
Just like that?

880
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,836
You would uproot
a 15-year-old American teenager

881
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:50,709
who came to this country
when she was 3 years old?

882
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,769
Who doesn't speak Bangla,

883
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,975
at least not with any fluency.

884
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,575
And based on the most
circumstantial of evidence,

885
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:59,213
you would exile her
to a Third World garbage dump

886
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,587
that to her might as well be
another planet?

887
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,650
That's exactly what
I'm going to do, counselor.

888
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,091
What about the rest of the family?

889
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,098
The two younger siblings
are American citizens.

890
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,793
Yes, they're American citizens,

891
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,699
and they're shit out of luck.

892
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,636
Unless...

893
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:37,918

?? [rock]

896
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:49,863
Have you got company?

897
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,531
No.

898
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,872
Are you looking for some?

899
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:06,886
I'm not being funny, all right, Claire?

900
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,948
But I just want to know
why some lNS guy

901
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,926
would commit fraud for you.

902
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:13,485
It's not like you're famous enough

903
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,292
- to get that kind of visa.
- All right.

904
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:19,597
No, I'm only saying.
I only know 'cause I tried.

905
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:22,467
Well, they don't call it the lNS anymore.

906
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,909
Gavin?

907
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,740
Come on.

908
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:32,805
I always thought I'd have to marry
an American guy.

909
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,646
That's why I didn't see
any point in us, you know?

910
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,050
But I don't have to do that now.

911
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,611
I don't have to marry an American guy.

912
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:41,122
I can be with the guy that I'm into.

913
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:46,759
This changes everything for us.

914
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,957
You know?

915
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:56,505
I just, uh...

916
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:02,075
I just want to know
why he's taking all that risk for you.

917
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,010
- You know?
- Oh.

918
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,983
- Are you paying him?
- [murmuring]

919
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,747
Where'd you even get the case worker?

920
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,185
Oh, baby.

921
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:14,246
No.

922
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:18,283
It-- Don't go there, baby.

923
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,988
Oh, come on, Claire.

924
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,463
How are you paying him?

925
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,464
Well... Come back.

926
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,592
No. How are you paying him, Claire?

927
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,331
How are you paying him?

928
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,576
No. No.

929
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,548
You are fucking kidding me.

930
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:43,643
You are fucking kidding me.

931
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,484
I am such a fucking idiot.

932
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,581
You are fuck-- Are you serious?

933
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:53,552
Baby, I want to be with you, baby.

934
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,892
You know I want to be with you.

935
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,329
Were you with him today?

936
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,162
- Please don't do this.
- Were you with him today?

937
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:00,099
- Baby, please don't do this.
- Just tell me. Were you with him today?

938
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:03,332
Was he inside of you today?
Were you with him today?

939
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:06,534
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck. How many times?

940
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,941
How many times, Claire?

941
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:10,104
I just want to know.

942
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,612
I just want to know
how fucked you have to get

943
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,706
to get a fucking green card!

944
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:15,410
Fuck!

945
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,756
Um...

946
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,198
as often as he wants.

947
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,570
It's only for two months,

948
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:44,704
and then I never have to see him again.

949
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,772
And I never have to worry

950
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:50,046
about being deported or being narced on.

951
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,644
I can just...

Thanks.

[Woman shouting in Spanish]

966
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,903
I'm sorry. You have very few options,

967
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:56,570
none of them favorable
to your situation.

968
01:01:56,646 --> 01:02:00,377
You may request
voluntary departure as an entire family

969
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,680
and leave the United States
immediately.

970
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:05,186
Or you may choose to fight the matter,

971
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:08,018
which inevitably would
lead to deportation.

972
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:09,854
[sobbing]

973
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:13,123
There is a third option.

974
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:15,756
And as painful as it is,

975
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,823
I am required to present it to you.

976
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:22,732
One of you could choose
voluntary departure

977
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:24,898
and leave with Taslima,

978
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,204
and one of you could remain in the U.S.

979
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:29,301
with Jahanara and Abul.

980
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:31,710
How is that possible?

981
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:34,477
Special Agent Phadkar has intimated to me

982
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,609
that if we were to choose
that course of action,

983
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,917
Immigration would not seek out
the remaining parent,

984
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:42,048
provided they kept a low profile.

985
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,617
There is something else
you should understand.

986
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,788
Whichever of you remains,

987
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,195
if you choose that,

988
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:52,564
if you try to see Taslima
before she leaves,

989
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:54,569
you would be taking a really big risk.

990
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:57,800
In all likelihood, she will be escorted
by lmmigration agents

991

- Good morning.
- Black suit.

Skulking's fine with me.

1025
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:09,096
I'm not exactly proud
of this arrangement.

01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:10,530
I don't want an arrangement.

- Cole--
- Just listen to me.

1028
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:15,268
I know this started in a fucked-up place.

1029
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,898
And that you are not here
on your own volition.

1030
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,534
And that there's a--

1031
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:27,413
there's a good chance
I probably make your skin crawl.

1032

I just want us to start over again.

1033
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:32,413
I wouldn't say who I was.

1034
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,547
I wouldn't put any kind of scare in you.

1035
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,057
Just ask you out for a cup of coffee.

1036
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:38,525
I'm not looking to renegotiate.

You're not hearing me.

1040
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:47,057
This is what you need
to understand, okay?

1041
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:50,367
When I come into
one of these fleabag rooms,

1042
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:53,101
I switch off.

1043
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,975
You might as well be making it
with a rubber fuck doll,

1044
01:06:57,046 --> 01:07:00,345
because she'd be giving you more emotion
than you'd ever get from me.

When I get home,

1046
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,682
I'm an hour in the shower,

1047
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,883
getting clean of you.

1048
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,186
That is the extent of it.

1049
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:15,788
That is as real
as it is ever going to get between us.

1050
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,095
Is that clear enough...

1051
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,566

01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:24,162
Hmm?

1053
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:31,975
So you want to do this now or what?

1054
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,769
You won't hear from me again.

1055
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:58,171

01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:39,172
Hey, listen,

1065
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:42,938
you left your jacket in the car
on the way back from the morgue.

1066
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:45,071
You were complaining
about the smell,

1067
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:46,910
so I took it to the dry cleaners.

1068
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:50,281
You can pick it up any time.

1069
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:54,482
That wasn't necessary, but thanks.

1070
01:09:57,193 --> 01:10:00,685
This fell out of the pocket
at the cleaners.

1071
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:08,127
I was wondering why it wasn't in
her personal effects envelope.

1072
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:12,402
She broke it a few days ago.

1073
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:14,374
I said I'd get it fixed.

1074
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:17,378
Repaired.

1075
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:21,678
I got a friend
with a shop on Western, and...

1076
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,219
Thanks for coming, Max.

1077
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:56,241
[Man] Gavin Kossef?

1078
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,015
Gavin Kossef!

1079
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,056
Uh, yeah.

1080
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:03,387
I have to be honest
with you, Mr. Kossef.

1081
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:06,451
I don't see much experience here
as a religious worker.

1082
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,223
You're not an ordained rabbi, are you?

1083
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,060
Uh, no, no, I'm not.

1084
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:13,329
But I've spent many years
devoted to my faith.

1085
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:15,495
Uh, I grew up in a religious family,

1086
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:16,970
I attended services regularly.

1087
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:19,769
I was bar mitzvahed.

1088
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,503
I've taken Jewish leadership courses--

1089
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:23,545
I'm still not sure that qualifies you.

1090
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,671
You know, I honor my religion daily.

1091
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:28,376
You know, in the Jewish
school where I teach,

1092
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:31,442
I lead the class in prayers.

1093
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,680
We discuss Bible stories.

1094
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,588
And you've been working
at this school illegally, right?

1095
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,819
Yes, l-- I have.

1096
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:40,054
Yeah. But I've admitted to that.

1097
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,721
You can read the language?

1098
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,698
- Hebrew, right?
- Yes.

1099
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:45,859
And what about the prayers?

1100
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:48,027
You can, uh-- You can recite

1101
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:49,627
the important prayers of your faith?

1102
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:50,729
You can do that, right?

1103
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,239
Uh, yes. Yes.

1104
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,709
I can do the prayer for wine,

1105
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:57,507
um, the prayer for bread--

1106
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,945
Excuse me just a moment.

1107
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,624
Shit.

1108
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:14,787
Fuck.

1109
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:21,102
Come in.
Close the door right behind you.

1110
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,934
[door closes]

1111
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:28,466
Mr. Kossef, this is Rabbi Yoffie.

1112
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,478
Uh, Rabbi.

1113
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,709
Ordinarily, I'd file
a request for evidence.

1114
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:42,450
But something tells me this approach
will prove more expedient.

1115
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,992
I'd like Mr. Kossef to recite a prayer

1116
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,085
to substantiate his knowledge of
the Jewish teachings

1117
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:48,652
above that of a layman's.

1118
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:51,359
If you could suggest something
and authenticate his response,

1119
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:53,333
I'd greatly appreciate it, Rabbi.

1120
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:59,400
You may recite
the Mourner's Kaddish, no?

1121
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:01,500
The Mourner's Kaddish?

1122
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:05,439
Nu?

1123
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:09,715
Uh, yes. Yeah.

1124
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:14,985
Uh... [clears throat]

1125
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:19,994
It's a tradition that you cover your head.

1126
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:24,260
If you just put your hands
on your head like that.

1127
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,527
Right?

1128
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:31,532
- Um... Iike that.
- Yeah.

1129
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,836
[singing Hebrew prayer]

1130
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,668
Amen.

1131
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:26,718
Very nice.

1132
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:28,558
Very moving.

1133
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:35,466
You should sing
in my services sometimes.

1134
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:38,165
Oh, l-- I would love to.

1135
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,174
Thank you very much, Rabbi.

1136
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:42,107
We'll be with you shortly.

1137
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:43,235
Thank you.

1138
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,375
Well, can't argue with that.

1139
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:53,314
Rabbi?

1140
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:58,655
I wasn't kidding about the voice.

1141
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:00,888
I expect you tomorrow morning,

1142
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,692
Temple Beth Shalom.

1143
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:05,790
About the rest, we can teach you.

1144
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:28,552
[speaking native language]

1145
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:40,632
I don't want to leave Jah and Abul.

1146
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:42,670
When will I ever see them again?

1147
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:48,002
Or Papa?

1148
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:54,841
He wants to be able
to say goodbye to you,

1149
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:57,613
but what if he was to come here today?

1150
01:15:57,686 --> 01:16:00,348
They would arrest him
and deport him as well.

1151
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:04,483
And then Jah and Abul
will have to leave as well.

1152
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,152
I don't care!

1153
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:09,459
Why can't we all go?

1154
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:10,793
Why do they get to stay?

1155
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:14,893
Because they were born here.

1156
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,995
And if they stay and finish school,

1157
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:20,007
they have more opportunities.

1158
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,669
And I don't

1159
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:25,611
because my life is shit now.

1160
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:26,841
[crying]

1161
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,678
I'm sorry. We're out of time.

1162
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:34,915
[gasping]

1163
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,218
[crying]

1164
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,857
Mommy!

1165
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,230
Mommy, please!

1166
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:47,825
Please!

1167
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:50,963
Please don't leave me, Mommy!

1168
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:53,030
[sobbing]

1169
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:55,133
[speaking native language]

1170
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:58,543
[kissing]

1171
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,072
Come, my sweets.

1172
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,979
Say goodbye to your sister.

1173
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:39,314
You won't be seeing her for a long time.

1174
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:43,825
[Woman]
Please, I need the room for the next visit.

1175
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:23,197
[sobbing]

1176
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:36,644
[Max]
Did Homicide see these tapes?

1177
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,179
No. They figured it was gang-related,

1178
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,077
so they only looked at
the night of the murder.

1179
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:42,776
Slow down. Slow down.
That's them.

1180
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:47,544
Stop.

1181
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,547
That's the girl.

1182
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,159
Back up a little bit.

1183
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:58,290
This car that just pulled in here.

1184
01:18:58,366 --> 01:18:59,958
Move in on there.

1185
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:07,868
Can't make anybody.

1186
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:11,572
Let's put another tape in.

1187
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:18,011
Roll on down.

1188
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:23,186
Slow it up. That's them.

1189
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,486
Stop.

1190
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:27,622
Well, I'll be damned.

1191
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:29,596
There he is again.

1192
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,566
- Can you go in on the license plate?
- Sure.

1193
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:43,510
2SAM564

1194
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:47,313
Let's go to the next day.

1195
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,918
There they are, coming out.

1196
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,089
Back up a little bit.

1197
01:19:58,693 --> 01:19:59,751
Go in on it.

1198
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:05,196
Same car.

1199
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:07,531
It's the same goddamn car.

1200
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,335
Let me run that.

1201
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,011
Another, please.

1202
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:38,129
Another, please.

1203
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,189
Last call, pal.

1204
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:01,848
[labored breathing]

1205
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:51,999
Hey, Yong. You ready to
pop your cherry, bitch?

1206
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:54,735
Fuckin' balls, man! Come on!

1207
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:56,242
Come on, you fuckin' pussy!

1208
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:04,309
[door slams]
Get your fuckin' hands up!

1209
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:08,186
[all yelling at once]

1210
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,884
Move, motherfucker! You, too, bitch!

1211
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:12,221
Move it! Come on!

1212
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:14,125
Stand the fuck down, you fucking cunt!

1213
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:15,822
Open the fucking door!

1214
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:17,364
Don't you fucking dick me, old man!

1215
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,423
Open the fucking door now!

1216
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:21,469
- [woman shouting]
- Open the fucking door!

1217
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:23,128
[store owner]
You making big mistake.

1218
01:22:23,204 --> 01:22:25,365
You have no idea
who money belongs to.

1219
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,772
If I give to you, I die anyway.

1220
01:22:27,842 --> 01:22:31,471
- [woman crying]
- Get the fuck back up, motherfucker!

1221
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:33,377
Get the fuck back up!

1222
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:38,552
[woman screams]

1223
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,882
Shut up!

1224
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:40,887
What the fuck?

1225
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,355
What'd you go and do that for?

1226
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:44,324
We weren't supposed to
hurt anyone, Seung!

1227
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:46,792
[woman screaming, crying]

1228
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:48,761
That's it! Search him! Find the key!

1229
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:54,065
Move, bitch! Shut the fuck up!

1230
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:56,365
- [screaming, crying continues]
- Shut the fuck up!

1231
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:58,736
Get the fuck up!

1232
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,640
[all yelling]

1233
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,008
Yeah, blow her fucking head
off if she tries anything! Let's go!

1234
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:05,808
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1235
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,508
- Where's the key?
- Right, which fucking key?

1236
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,551
- Which key? Which key?
- [screaming] I don't know!

1237
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:14,816
- Which fucking key, bitch?
- [all yelling at once]

1238
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:22,393
- Fuck it. We're all in--
- [cocks gun]

1239
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:47,077
Put it down, man. I'll do it. I swear!

1240
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:49,020
You'll do her?

1241
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,718
Where the fuck did you
learn to talk like that, huh?

1242
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:54,353
You get that on some American cop show
while you're growing up in Seoul?

1243
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:57,227
I'm not from fucking Seoul.
I'm from [speaks Korean].

1244
01:23:57,298 --> 01:24:01,257
Hey. How old were you when you came over?
You still got an accent.

1245
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:04,601
- I'm gonna say maybe 1 1, 12 years old.
- I don't give a shit!

1246
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:07,266
I'm gonna blow this bag's
head off if you don't put down your gun!

1247
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:10,175
Uh-huh. You still on the green card?

1248
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:12,645
I'm American citizen, raghead!

1249
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:14,443
My whole family just got naturalized!

1250
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:16,541
We're doing all
ceremony shit tomorrow!

1251
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:18,210
Oh, tomorrow?

1252
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:21,221
Hey. You haven't taken your oath yet.

1253
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:22,654
That means you're not a citizen.

1254
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,954
Not until you take the oath.

1255
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:29,725
And I don't see how the fuck
that's gonna happen now, you know?

1256
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:33,700
You're either gonna die here,
or you're going away for murder.

1257
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:35,793
You have done your parents proud.

1258
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:37,997
[crying]
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

1259
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,938
They told me no one get hurt.

1260
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:41,600
I didn't kill anyone!

1261
01:24:41,676 --> 01:24:42,938
What am I supposed to do?

1262
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:45,172
I don't know what to fucking do!

1263
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:48,340
- How many in your family?
- Why do you keep asking about my family?

1264
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:50,111
They're not here now, are they?

1265
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:51,812
[whispers]
How many in your family?

1266
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:56,279
My parents.

1267
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:01,552
My younger brother and sister.

1268
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,228
My sister was born here.

1269
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:14,203
[deep sigh]

1270
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:17,244
Well, tomorrow was supposed
to be a special day.

1271
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:20,873
And you shit on it
for your whole family.

1272
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,883
I've been through it.

1273
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:26,944
It was the most spiritual
moment of my life.

1274
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:30,252
You know, you're standing there,

1275
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:33,726
Iooking around you
at all these people from everywhere.

1276
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:35,820
Countries you can't even pronounce,

1277
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:37,524
you didn't even know existed.

1278
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:42,126
And they're happy.

1279
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:45,070
They're elated to be there

1280
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,971
because it's their choice.

1281
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:50,772
[crying continues]

1282
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:54,804
You wouldn't be here right now,

1283
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:57,443
in this mess you're in,

1284
01:25:57,519 --> 01:26:02,547
if you could ever appreciate the awe
you'd feel in that moment.

1285
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:04,421
The worthiness of the journey.

1286
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:11,092
So,

1287
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,463
when you're standing there tomorrow,

1288
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:14,195
in your new suit and tie,

1289
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:16,464
I want you to look around.

1290
01:26:16,538 --> 01:26:21,066
Okay? Look at those faces.

1291
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:24,771
And understand
the sublime promise of this moment.

1292
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:33,477
What the fuck, man.

1293
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:36,183
I'm not gonna be there.
You said it yourself.

1294
01:26:36,257 --> 01:26:38,316
Stop messing with my head.

1295
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:41,851
All right. The way to end this,

1296
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:44,262
my friend, is for you
to put down your gun.

1297
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:45,663
- Now I'm gonna put mine--
- What the fuck!

1298
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:49,191
[gun clicks]
What the fuck are you doing?

1299
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:50,396
[whimpering]
What the fuck--

1300
01:26:50,471 --> 01:26:52,939
Now you put down your gun.

1301
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:56,101
Let go of that woman.
You go in that back room.

1302
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:58,611
You take the surveillance
tapes out of the system.

1303
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,514
Okay? And you keep on walking.

1304
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:05,815
You're fucking with me.
Stop fucking with me!

1305
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:08,685
You think I'm some jackoff? Huh?

1306
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:10,781
- [distant sirens]
- I think you made a mistake,

1307
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:14,316
and you will never make
a mistake like this again.

1308
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:15,987
[sirens closer]

1309
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,656
[screaming]

1310
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:24,567
- [sirens outside]
- [brakes squeal]

1311
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:37,985
LAPD! Put your hands up!

1312
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:40,247
Get 'em up!

1313
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:42,186
Relax.

1314
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,918
Situation's under control.

1315
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,926
Help me out here.
You're saying there were four of them,

1316
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:49,157
but the owner's wife is
positive there were five.

1317
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:51,198
She says you let one of them walk.

1318
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:54,793
She also says you let him take
the surveillance tapes with him.

1319
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:58,566
She's confused. She had her
head down most of the time.

1320
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,302
Hey, I killed four of them.
Why would I let one go?

1321
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,469
I look crazy to you?

1322
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,239
I can tell you how many there were.

1323
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:09,515
There were only four. She's mistaken.

1324
01:28:09,584 --> 01:28:14,385
This man, he saved our lives.

1325
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:15,820
There were four.

1326
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:17,050
The witness has corroborated it.

1327
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,025
They must have been
lax in surveillance.

1328
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:20,526
Probably just covering up
for insurance purposes.

1329
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:21,857
[phone rings]

1330
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:39,036
[door shuts]

1331
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,509
[dials number]

1332
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,517
Hamid. Where the fuck are you?

1333
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:51,888
I need to talk to you
as soon as possible.

1334
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:54,154
Give me a call as soon
as you get this message.

1335
01:28:54,228 --> 01:28:56,526
Immediately. I don't care what time it is.

1336
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,868
[Machine beeps]
One message.

1337
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,406
Max, it's Kevin.

1338
01:29:06,474 --> 01:29:08,408
Listen, call me when you can.

1339
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:09,636
Just a heads up.

1340
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:12,009
LAPD contacted me a few minutes ago.

1341
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:15,709
Apparently, Hamid was
involved in a shootout tonight in Koreatown.

1342
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:17,751
Don 't worry. He's fine,
but I'm heading over

1343
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,912
to the crime scene now to check things out.

1344
01:29:19,987 --> 01:29:22,046
Try me on my cell.

1345
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:24,182
[Machine beeps]
End of messages.

1346
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:36,801
[knock on door]

1347
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:38,964
" I'm not interested in you.
I'm not interested.

1348
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,905
"I'm not interested in you.

1349
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:42,943
For one, you're too old for me."

1350
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:45,205
[knocking continues]

1351
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:47,213
Miss Shepard,
I'm Special Agent Ludwig

1352
01:29:47,281 --> 01:29:49,772
with lCE's Document
and Benefit fraud unit.

1353
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:53,082
This is my partner, Special Agent Howell.

1354
01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:55,645
May we have a word
with you inside, please?

1355
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:00,821
We discovered these
and quite a few others

1356
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:03,864
when we performed a search
of Javier Pedraza's apartment.

1357
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:06,297
I didn't, um, use these.
I didn't go back for them.

1358
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:09,359
- So you can't, um--
- You see what's interesting, Miss Shepard,

1359
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:11,462
is we ran a check on your name.

1360
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,507
A Claire Shepard arrived
on a B2 visitor's visa

1361
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:14,905
seven months ago.

1362
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:17,467
And then just two days ago,
she has her status adjusted

1363
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:21,140
to an EB-1 green card for
persons of extraordinary ability.

1364
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:23,183
According to the lnternet Movie Database,

1365
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:24,513
the only Claire Shepard

1366
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:26,985
that matches your spelling,
age, and place of birth,

1367
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:29,545
has two credits on
little-known Aussie TV shows.

1368
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:31,148
Walk-on roles.

1369
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,284
She hasn't won any national
or international awards.

1370
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:36,228
Which is something
the adjudicator who handled your case

1371
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:38,026
would have to have been aware of.

1372
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:41,694
And yet he approved you for an EB-1.

1373
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,237
Miss Shepard.

1374
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:46,830
We'd like you to tell us
about your relationship

1375
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:49,638
with Center Adjudications
Officer Cole Frankel.

1376
01:30:55,883 --> 01:30:58,113
Congratulations, McGill.

1377
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:05,219
Mr. Frankel.

1378
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:08,091
Special Agents Poulson and Womack.

1379
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:09,754
OlG.

1380
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:11,856
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1381
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:14,629
What is this, a joke?

1382
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:17,296
I take it you're familiar
with Claire Shepard.

1383
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:19,896
She just traded you
for voluntary departure.

1384
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:22,901
Turn around, please.

1385
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:24,137
Hands behind your back.

1386
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:26,578
Do you have to do this?
Do you have to cuff me?

1387
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:27,841
Yeah, I'm afraid we do.

1388
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,691
What the hell is this?

1389
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:43,662
Cole, where are you go--
where-- what's going on?

1390
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:47,633
Ma'am, your husband is under arrest
for immigration fraud.

1391
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:49,329
Cole.

1392
01:31:57,612 --> 01:31:59,842
Good morning, everyone.

1393
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:02,712
My name is Judge Leslie Freeman,

1394
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:04,478
of the Federal District Court.

1395
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:09,854
And it is my great pleasure
to welcome you here today.

1396
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:14,020
All of you seated here
share one thing in common.

1397
01:32:14,095 --> 01:32:17,223
You have all chosen,
of your own free will,

1398
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:20,631
to become citizens of this great nation.

1399
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:25,464
For many of you, the road
to this joyous moment

1400
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:29,533
has been fraught with
hardship and sacrifice.

1401
01:32:30,778 --> 01:32:33,770
It is incumbent upon me to remind you

1402
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:37,147
of your newfound responsibilities
as citizens,

1403
01:32:37,218 --> 01:32:40,415
and also to remind you
that an American citizenship

1404
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:42,649
is not a guarantee of success

1405
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:45,590
but rather the promise of opportunities.

1406
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,992
Unlimited opportunities.

1407
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:49,996
It has always been my contention

1408
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:53,090
that America is a welcoming nation,

1409
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:55,931
a country that accepts every new citizen

1410
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:58,995
with an embrace of good faith.

1411
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:02,873
You have endless credit
to pursue your hopes and dreams,

1412
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:07,779
as long as you honor
the rules and laws of our society.

1413
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:10,681
I myself am a first-generation American.

1414
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:12,844
- I guess I called it right.
- Max?

1415
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,115
Well, he's gotta put the family first.

1416
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:17,589
Ain't that right, Hamid?

1417
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:19,523
You know what I'm talking about.

1418
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:22,688
- Do we have to do this right now?
- Yes, God damn it. Right now.

1419
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:27,762
An innocent--
yes, innocent young woman

1420
01:33:27,835 --> 01:33:30,360
was brutally murdered 'cause
she flashed a little tit

1421
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:32,736
on occasion, got it on
with a married man,

1422
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:36,743
tried to live her life
outside your goddamn family.

1423
01:33:36,811 --> 01:33:40,747
She was your sister.

1424
01:33:40,815 --> 01:33:44,251
She deserved better
than that from you.

1425
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:47,776
In this country,
we don't abide by that shit.

1426
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:50,415
We got a name for it. Murder.

1427
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:53,051
Cold-blooded murder.

1428
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:56,563
And you and Farid
are going down for it.

1429
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,690
Will our new citizens please stand?

1430
01:33:58,766 --> 01:34:01,496
Raise your right hand

1431
01:34:01,569 --> 01:34:05,198
and join me in reciting
the Oath of Allegiance.

1432
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:07,297
I hereby declare on oath--

1433
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:09,900
I've got the surveillance
tapes from the motel.

1434
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:15,578
From the day before.
From last week.

1435
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,278
I.D.'d Farid's Beemer.

1436
01:34:18,352 --> 01:34:20,411
He was watching her,
reporting back to you,

1437
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:22,183
waiting for you to take action.

1438
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:25,157
I begged him, Max, to leave it alone,

1439
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:27,854
but he was being
pressured by our father.

1440
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:30,954
We both were.
He poisoned Farid's mind

1441
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:33,592
with this talk about the shame
that we brought on our family,

1442
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:35,795
because of her. But he never--

1443
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:40,330
he never intended
for this to happen.

1444
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:46,811
Only that we would
teach her a lesson.

1445
01:34:46,881 --> 01:34:49,577
We were supposed to
catch them in the act

1446
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:50,708
and beat them like dogs.

1447
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:53,447
My father wanted Zahra humiliated,

1448
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,716
- brought in line.
- Congratulations to all you citizens.

1449
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:58,418
[cheering]

1450
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:06,529
I wanted no part of it.

1451
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:11,902
I thought if I just turned my back,

1452
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:13,269
it would all go away.

1453
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:20,142
[Judge]
And now will you please stand

1454
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:22,682
and place your right hand over your heart

1455
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:26,777
as we listen to Phil Perry
sing our National Anthem.

1456
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:28,947
? Oh say ?

1457
01:35:29,023 --> 01:35:33,460
? Can you see ?

1458
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:35,859
? By the dawn's ?

1459
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:40,333
? early light ?

1460
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:44,428
He arrived at my apartment that night.

1461
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:46,439
After he--

1462
01:35:46,507 --> 01:35:47,439
After he--

1463
01:35:47,508 --> 01:35:49,601
[door slams]

1464
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,848
Help me, Hamid.
Please, God, help me.

1465
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:57,978
How did you get this?

1466
01:35:58,052 --> 01:35:59,883
Where's Zahra?

1467
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:02,320
- I only wanted to scare her.
- What are you talking about?

1468
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:04,323
I couldn't stand it anymore.

1469
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:07,588
- Her seeing a degenerate fucking beaner.
- What did you do, Farid?

1470
01:36:07,661 --> 01:36:09,322
I only wanted to get
in his face a little bit.

1471
01:36:09,396 --> 01:36:11,023
You have to take this.

1472
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:13,396
You're a cop. You know how
to do that kind of stuff.

1473
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:14,627
What did you do, Farid?

1474
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:16,135
I looked in the door.

1475
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:18,194
They were doing it like animals.

1476
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:19,933
Oh, shit!

1477
01:36:20,007 --> 01:36:22,532
What the fuck are you doing?
Get out of here!

1478
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:23,599
What the fuck is this shit?

1479
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:25,167
What's your fucking problem?

1480
01:36:26,647 --> 01:36:28,877
What did you do to our sister?
Tell me what you did!

1481
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:30,780
She's my girl, man.

1482
01:36:30,851 --> 01:36:32,842
She's my girl. Don't be stupid.

1483
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,683
Put the fucking gun down.

1484
01:36:34,755 --> 01:36:35,881
[laughing]

1485
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:37,981
Get the fuck outta here, man!

1486
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:42,051
[screaming]

1487
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:45,189
- [gunshot]
- ? In air ?

1488
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:49,066
? Gave proof ?

1489
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:52,936
? Through this night ?

1490
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:54,998
You should have come
to me, God damn it.

1491
01:36:55,075 --> 01:36:57,873
I was ashamed.

1492
01:36:57,945 --> 01:36:59,913
Ashamed of myself.

1493
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:00,969
My family.

1494
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:07,318
Better get yourself
a good criminal attorney, Counselor.

1495
01:37:07,388 --> 01:37:08,787
You're gonna need one.

1496
01:37:08,856 --> 01:37:11,324
?...star-spangled ?

1497
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:17,729
? Banner yet wave ?

1498
01:37:20,267 --> 01:37:23,065
[no audible dialogue]

1499
01:37:24,538 --> 01:37:28,975
? For the land of the free ?

1500
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:31,443
Running out on our National Anthem.

1501
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,309
Now, that's just plain disrespectful.

1502
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:37,476
? And the home ?

1503
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:41,988
? Of the ?

1504
01:37:42,056 --> 01:37:43,648
? Brave ?

1505
01:37:43,724 --> 01:37:45,123
Farid Baraheri, you are under arrest

1506
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:47,387
for the murder of your
sister, Zahra Baraheri,

1507
01:37:47,461 --> 01:37:48,450
and Javier Pedraza.

1508
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,793
[cheering]

1509
01:38:00,641 --> 01:38:04,634
[Judge]
Congratulations to all our new citizens.

1510
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:07,442
Good luck to all of you.

1511
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:19,725
[Officer]
820 Bravo.

1512
01:38:19,793 --> 01:38:22,956
75 approaching position
reported by Foxtrot.

1513
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:38,310

1514
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:34,259
[flies buzzing]

1515
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:52,084
820 on 10-42 Delta.

1516
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:54,814
Approximately eighth of a mile
east of Ambush Alley.

1517
01:39:54,888 --> 01:39:57,948
Confirming a female victim.
Mexican national.

1518
01:39:58,025 --> 01:39:59,754
Approximate age, mid-20s.

1519
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:03,160
Looks like she's been
out here a couple of days.

1520
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:05,926
I think she paid the wrong
coyote to bring her across.

1521
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,332
I copy. You are 10-42 Delta

1522
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:10,461
one eighth mile east of Ambush Alley.

1523
01:40:10,537 --> 01:40:12,596
I'll contact the PD and the coroner.

1524
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:15,403

[no audible dialogue]

1529
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:11,587
Guess who's going home today.

1530
01:42:11,658 --> 01:42:13,353
All of my friends leave.

1531
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:14,826
Not today, sweetie.

1532
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:16,624
Someone's come for you.

1533
01:42:28,108 --> 01:42:29,666
[computer blips]

1534
01:42:32,446 --> 01:42:34,607
[typing]

1535
01:43:17,624 --> 01:43:20,149
Uh-oh. All right. [laughing]

1536
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:41,540
When we get in there,
it's gonna be a real clusterfuck,

1537
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:43,845
so watch your ass.

1538
01:43:43,917 --> 01:43:45,748
You got it.

1539
01:43:45,819 --> 01:43:47,116
[sighs]
Here we go.

1540
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:48,211
[phone rings]

1541
01:43:48,288 --> 01:43:49,585
Wait a second.

1542
01:43:50,624 --> 01:43:52,592

1543
01:43:52,659 --> 01:43:54,923
Brogan.

1544
01:43:54,995 --> 01:43:56,087
Yeah, that was me.

1545
01:44:01,501 --> 01:44:03,264
You sure about that?

1546
01:44:03,337 --> 01:44:05,066
Mireya Sanchez.

1547
01:44:09,676 --> 01:44:11,234
What about the family? Have you--

1548
01:44:11,311 --> 01:44:15,543
Uh, do me a favor, will ya?
Hold off on that.

1549
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,584
I'd like to take care of it myself.

1550
01:44:19,386 --> 01:44:22,753
I just want to do right by her.

1551
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:28,257
Thanks. I'll be down
as soon as I'm off shift.

1552
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:32,998
God damn it, Max. We gotta roll, man.

1553
01:44:36,403 --> 01:44:37,995
Max! We gotta go!

- [starts engine]
- Don't worry, Lieutenant.

1556
01:44:41,408 --> 01:44:42,773
You're not gonna miss anything.
