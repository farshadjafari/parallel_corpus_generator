1
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,725
Why is it that a father is
never able to tell his son...

2
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,058
how much he loves him?

3
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,392
He's never able to embrace him
and say 'I love you my son'?

4
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,183
And the mother?

5
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:13,808
She keeps repeating it, whether
her son listens to it or not.

6
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:18,308
But that doesn't mean
a father loves his son any less.

7
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:23,058
No one can fathom the amount of love
that a mother has for her son...

8
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:24,850
not even the mother.

9
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,058
Because there is no measure
for a mother's love.

10
00:01:27,892 --> 00:01:30,058
It's an emotion
that can only be felt...

11
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,058
a mother's emotion.

12
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:36,058
Rahul, my son... my life!

13
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,392
The match between Woodstock
International and Manor House...

14
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:24,350
is at a very interesting turn.
5 runs and one ball...

15
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:27,350
Can Woodstock International's 9-year
victory spell be broken in just a ball?

16
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,767
Captain Vivek Singh spreads his field
towards the boundaries...

17
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:32,267
...and the two batsmen
take their positions.

18
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,392
The excitement among the students
is rising.

19
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:36,225
The tension is mounting.

20
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:39,392
Manor House needs five runs
in one ball... Will Rohan do it?

21
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:47,600
It's up to Rohan to break.

22
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:50,517
Woodstock International's nine-year
spell of victory... Seems impossible.

23
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:53,600
Nothing is impossible. The entire game
rests on Rohan's shoulders.

24
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:56,683
Manor House is confident that
Rohan will do it!

25
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:25,392
if you want to be someone in life,
if you want to achieve something...

26
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,392
if you want to win,
always listen to your heart.

27
00:05:29,642 --> 00:05:31,558
And if your heart
doesn't give you any answers,

28
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,808
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

29
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,475
And then you will cross
all the hurdles...

30
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:43,183
all your problems will vanish...
victory will be yours.

31
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:45,267
Only yours.

32
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:52,100
Hey, Mom and Dad...
I won I won...

33
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:56,392
I was the Man of the match...
Hey Dad...

34
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,725
I watched you on CNN.
You looked great.

35
00:06:59,142 --> 00:07:01,350
Now I know where I get
my good looks from.

36
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:04,392
Anyway, I have just completed
my final term and...

37
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:07,183
I'm coming home for Diwali.
Can't wait to see you guys.

38
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:09,058
Lots of Love, Rohan.

39
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,683
P. S... Before I come home
I'm stopping at Hardwar to meet...

40
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:22,683
my two favourite girlfriends.

41
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,017
Hardwar?
Who are these girlfriends in Hardwar?

42
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:29,683
My two grandmothers...
maternal and paternal!

43
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,850
...8 a.m.

44
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:06,600
Are you watching the photograph and
crying again?

45
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:08,600
Where am I crying?

46
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:10,600
Of course not...
Where are you crying?

47
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:13,725
That's one truth and the other one is
that you are very young...

48
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:17,267
Stop joking with me
early in the morning...

49
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:19,392
What's the matter, Lajoji?

50
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:22,600
I remember Rahul
very often these days.

51
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:25,392
Even I remember him.

52
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:27,017
But in the last few days...

53
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:29,017
I have been feeling
very restless with his memories.

54
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:30,392
But why?

55
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:33,350
Listen...
We have lived our full lives.

56
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:36,183
Speak for yourself... I have
a long life ahead... Touchwood!

57
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:39,933
Yes...
But I have to reach God's abode...

58
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:41,892
How will I face Him there?

59
00:08:42,642 --> 00:08:46,392
How will I explain the reason, why
I couldn't unite my scattered family?

60
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:49,600
That I couldn't bring
my grandson back home?

61
00:08:50,558 --> 00:08:52,267
How will I show my face to Him?

62
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:54,767
Don't worry about it.

63
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:58,183
You are not going to meet God anyway...
- Why?

64
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:00,350
Because he doesn't meet anyone
in Hell...

65
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:05,058
God... again your jokes
early in the morning...

66
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:06,517
Hey you sweethearts...

67
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,017
Rohan!

68
00:09:10,558 --> 00:09:13,642
Naani.
- My child.

69
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:17,517
What's the matter, Naani?
You look very sexy.

70
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,517
I know. Everyone says the same thing.

71
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:26,267
May you live long.

72
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:30,183
You have become very weak my son.

73
00:09:30,642 --> 00:09:33,058
Now everyone can't be
as healthy as you are.

74
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:34,933
Oh! Just Shut up now.

75
00:09:40,642 --> 00:09:43,350
What's the matter, Naani?
- What happened? Is she crying?

76
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,642
Then it's fine. I get very worried
when she doesn't weep.

77
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:50,892
Just see... Rohan!
- Oh now stop it you two...

78
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:01,850
Please stop crying Lajoji...
Please stop.

79
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:05,225
Your tears will raise a lot of
questions in Rohan's mind and...

80
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:07,558
we won't have any answers
to his questions.

81
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:10,558
What do I do Kaur?
What do I do?

82
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:15,558
Whenever I see Rohan,
I think of Rahul even more

83
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:20,267
Don't you think we should
tell him everything?

84
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,558
How can we tell him, Lajoji?
Yash has warned us against it.

85
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:27,350
Rohan was not even in town
when Rahul left home...

86
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:29,517
He doesn't know anything.

87
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:31,933
I think we should
tell him everything.

88
00:10:32,558 --> 00:10:34,808
Where do we begin?
What do we tell him?

89
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:39,517
He doesn't even know that Rahul was
not born to Yash and Nandini.

90
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:41,933
He was adopted.

91
00:10:57,558 --> 00:11:01,725
Rahul was two days old when
Yash and Nandini brought him home.

92
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:07,600
His tiny footsteps made a place
in all our hearts.

93
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:29,142
He became Nandini's lifeline and
Yash's dream was fulfilled.

94
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:33,767
Nine years later,
when you were born...

95
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:38,475
we felt that
our family was now complete.

96
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:45,142
I still remember
the astrologer saying that...

97
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:48,017
you fought destiny to be born.

98
00:11:49,517 --> 00:11:51,475
You would be our strength.

99
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:56,017
Did Rahul bhaiyya know
that he was...?

100
00:11:58,183 --> 00:12:00,058
Rahul was eight years old
when he got to know.

101
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:33,392
That was when Yash decided that...

102
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:37,058
the matter would never be mentioned
again in the house...

103
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:39,392
Never again...

104
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,850
Rahul was our son.
The eldest son of the house.

105
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:46,392
It was a truth that could
never be changed.

106
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,392
But the fact was mentioned again...
Suddenly.

107
00:12:53,433 --> 00:13:01,142
And that was Rahul's last Diwali with
his family... Last Diwali.

108
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:26,517
Oh Allah! Rohan baba,
you have become so fat...

109
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:28,142
that nothing fits you anymore.

110
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,892
What's DJ? Say Daijaan.

111
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:44,142
"It's all your blessings"

112
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:53,892
whether smiles or tears"

113
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:59,725
"We shall never part,
through smiles or through tears."

114
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:49,267
"I feel you in every breath
of mine..."

115
00:14:50,225 --> 00:14:54,267
"my life is but under your shadow"

116
00:14:55,433 --> 00:15:00,017
"I feel you in every breath
of mine..."

117
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,183
"my life is but under your shadow"

118
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:10,517
"I pray to thee as long as I live"

119
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:16,017
"It's all your boons...
Whether smiles or tears"

120
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:22,183
"We shall never part...
through smiles nor through tears"

121
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:08,225
"We light the lamps of love
at your feet"

122
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,892
"We see you everywhere
in everything we see"

123
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:47,933
"Our lips chant no name but yours"

124
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:52,725
"Let our hearts be filled
with nothing but your love"

125
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:58,225
"It's all your boons...
whether smiles or tears"

126
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:04,017
We shall never part...
through smiles nor through tears"

127
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:54,350
Hey maa... How do you always sense
my presence much before I arrive?

128
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:40,475
Rahul... just tell me one thing...
Emails, letters, faxes...

129
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:43,933
I sent you all of these and you
didn't reply to any... very rude.

130
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:46,183
MBA is a tough job, Naina!

131
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,558
Was it only MBA that kept you busy?
Or was there something else?

132
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:51,725
I mean someone else.

133
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:54,933
Well... It was more than just
one... you know me...

134
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:57,725
Ha... You stud you.
- Ya... me stud me.

135
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,475
Tell me Rahul.
- What do you think?

136
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:04,058
I think...
- What do you think?

137
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:06,558
I think, Rahul...
- What do you think, Naina?

138
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:10,392
Rahul, I don't think anyone other than
me can waste her time with you.

139
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,725
In any case what do you know
what to do with a girl.

140
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:16,850
Oh really?
Is this done with a girl?

141
00:21:17,517 --> 00:21:19,892
Stop it Rahul...
- Tell me...

142
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:22,433
Did you remember me at all?

143
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:25,392
Should I tell you the truth or lie?
- Lie...

144
00:21:25,808 --> 00:21:29,933
If I have to lie then I'd say I did...
not remember you at all...

145
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:33,017
How sweet!
- Let's talk about you.

146
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:35,850
Are you still the same or is
some mad guy interested in you?

147
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:39,642
What do you think?
- I think...

148
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:41,517
What do you think, Rahul?

149
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:43,892
I think...
- What do you think, Rahul?

150
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:50,225
I think, Naina...
I will beat you to that door.

151
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:53,892
Really?
- Really.

152
00:21:54,308 --> 00:21:55,642
Don't bet on that.

153
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:10,600
Yes... yes...
Don't you have to go to school?

154
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,142
Thank you... C'mon,
eat this... What's the score?

155
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,600
104 for 6... isn't that great?
- Damn good yaar. How many overs?

156
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,058
God, bhaiyya... I think
India is going to kill England.

157
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,558
Anything can happen
at the last minute.

158
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,808
You can't bank on them too much.
You never know with India, Rohan.

159
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,517
Here... take this...
Out Out... What’s the big deal?

160
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:37,267
England was out of lndia in 1947.

161
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:39,808
DJ... that was a PJ...

162
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:42,558
Oh Allah...
What are these? Legs or...?

163
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,600
He still hasn't learnt
how to tie his shoe laces?

164
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,225
So what? He's a child yet...
He'll learn...

165
00:22:46,392 --> 00:22:48,517
But if you don't allow him to do it
himself, how will he learn? Fatty.

166
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,392
Why did you come back from London?

167
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:53,600
What's happening here?

168
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,600
Mom you have over fed Rohan and
turned him into a pumpkin.

169
00:22:57,392 --> 00:22:59,600
Yes, yes please laugh at me...
When I go away to...

170
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,808
the boarding school you will all
remember me. Nobody loves me.

171
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:05,517
By the way Fatty...
Mother loves me more than you.

172
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:09,433
- DJ... Just look at him.
- Calm down. He's jealous of you.

173
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:14,475
Mom, I missed you.
- I missed you too, baby.

174
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,517
You won't leave me again
and go, will you?

175
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:20,725
I won't, but promise me, you will not
feed me the way you, this pumpkin.

176
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:25,725
Nandini! Nandini!

177
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:27,892
Yes... Coming.

178
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:31,183
You have forgotten me
as soon as your son has arrived.

179
00:23:31,683 --> 00:23:34,558
Who will knot this tie?
- Can't you do even that without me?

180
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:50,725
Here... Now you truly look like
Mrs. Yashvardhan Raichand.

181
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,683
This is for you my son.

182
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:28,683
From today, the Raichand Empire
belongs to you.

183
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,558
Oops, Sorry Dad.
That's your grandfather. Salute him.

184
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:10,600
You know Rahul,
Thirty years ago he said...

185
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:15,350
certain things to me in this chamber,
which I will now repeat to you.

186
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:21,100
He said life offers you many
paths to choose from.

187
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:24,600
You must always choose
the one that is right...

188
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:28,183
the one where you don't have to
bend... where you don't fall.

189
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:31,350
Never take a step in life...

190
00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:35,017
that will bring shame to
your family name or prestige.

191
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,600
Anyone can make money but earning
respect is not everyone's cup of tea.

192
00:25:45,642 --> 00:25:48,600
I have not forgotten
his words till today.

193
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:55,892
Even you should not.

194
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,517
Promise me that you will follow
the traditions of the family.

195
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,517
Promise me that you'll never compromise
with the self-respect of our family.

196
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:16,392
I promise papa...

197
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,767
that I will always keep
the family name flying high.

198
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:26,558
I promise you that I will always
keep you happy... always Papa

199
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:31,558
We have won.

200
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,892
Pooja, Pooja
- What happened?

201
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,017
We have won the match.

202
00:26:45,392 --> 00:26:48,517
God, Sachin played so well...
100 runs not out.

203
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:53,558
Ok now listen, take care
of the shop I will be back.

204
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:55,350
Haldiraaam!

205
00:26:57,975 --> 00:27:00,808
What a game!
What a game! What a game!

206
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:03,600
What a game!! By the way
what game are we playing?

207
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,058
India has won the match!
- Oh so we have won... How nice.

208
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,142
If you didn't know,
what were you dancing for?

209
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:12,017
I was dancing because
all the laddoos...

210
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:14,267
that my wife made
have been sold.

211
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:16,183
Sold out? How come?

212
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:18,350
There was a customer who told me
he wanted to eat laddoos...

213
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,725
that would drive him crazy.

214
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:24,392
Eating her laddos can cure
people who are insane and...

215
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:27,475
those who are normal become...
- Clean bowled!

216
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,683
It was just a joke...
- Stop it now...

217
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:31,475
Haven't even started it yet...
- Come on...

218
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,267
Rukhsar!
- Stop shouting so loudly...

219
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:37,642
The groom's side has come to
see Rukhsar for marriage.

220
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,850
Sit down. Salute them.

221
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:45,267
Grandmom... wake up...
the bride has arrived.

222
00:27:48,975 --> 00:27:51,183
Oh! Masha Allah Masha Allah...

223
00:27:51,517 --> 00:27:53,475
Her face is bright like
the full moon.

224
00:27:54,517 --> 00:27:57,142
She is just what I had imagined.

225
00:27:57,517 --> 00:28:00,850
Well... it's not me... its...
This is my daughter, Rukhsar.

226
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:03,058
What? Fever?

227
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:05,225
Not fever... mother,
She's Rukhsar!

228
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:07,642
Oh Rukhsar!

229
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:14,183
What happen?
- We have won the match.

230
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:16,392
My daughter's very
quiet and introverted.

231
00:28:16,725 --> 00:28:19,808
We have won.
- Allah! What happened?

232
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:21,600
Quiet and introverted... eh?

233
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:25,392
Incidentally, what is her age?

234
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:28,225
Hundred.
- Grandmom, she says...

235
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:30,183
- she's hundred years old.
- What? Nine years old?

236
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:34,808
She's going to turn twenty-one soon.
- Well... the blossoming of youth.

237
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:38,183
Actually we live in Lucknow.
But this is Chandni Chowk,

238
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:43,392
I guess... anyway I forgot to
tell you, my son's name is Ashfaque.

239
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:45,558
Sachin!
- Sachin?

240
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,392
Sachin? In case there's
someone else in her life...

241
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:49,767
No! No! Please don't say such things.

242
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:55,725
It's... her uncle Sachin...
her late uncle Sachin.

243
00:28:56,225 --> 00:28:57,475
She was very attached to him.

244
00:28:57,725 --> 00:28:59,725
She always remembers
him on happy occasions.

245
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:03,683
Sachin...
Poor Sachin...

246
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:12,350
C'mon you girls...
I'll teach you a lesson...

247
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:14,350
Oh God, Is everything alright?

248
00:29:14,642 --> 00:29:16,933
Forget about me...
tell me what has she done this time?

249
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:18,517
Ask me what she hasn't.

250
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:20,475
A nice wedding proposal
would have slipped out of our hands.

251
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:21,725
What?

252
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:23,683
180 by 100...
your blood pressure is high.

253
00:29:24,183 --> 00:29:25,517
You mean BP is high-wigh!

254
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:27,850
Yes, it's high and it's
'why' because of you.

255
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,725
I have just increased the dosage.
Please get these medicines.

256
00:29:34,892 --> 00:29:37,350
Om Bhai, you must take care of yourself.
- This won't do...

257
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:39,808
Yes, Aunty... he just doesn't
take care of himself.

258
00:29:40,183 --> 00:29:42,142
You just keep quiet...
I don't want to talk to you...

259
00:29:42,392 --> 00:29:45,142
Why?
- Why? What is Sayeeda saying?

260
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:49,183
Oh! I wasn't serious at all.
I was just joking.

261
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,892
That's surprising...
You have spoilt my two daughters...

262
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:56,850
Aren't they like my children too?
Anyway, leave all this aside.

263
00:29:57,392 --> 00:30:00,100
The good news is that
they liked this mad girl...

264
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:02,350
they have accepted the proposal.
- They have accepted?

265
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:05,392
Didn't they see you properly?

266
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:07,683
Shut up!

267
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,392
So you will leave us and go...?

268
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,683
Some day all you girls have to leave.

269
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,058
No way am I leaving
my father and going anywhere.

270
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:18,350
Even I'm not going.
- So then should I leave?

271
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:20,058
Why do you speak like this, father?

272
00:30:20,392 --> 00:30:22,475
Some day you have to get married,
my child.

273
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:25,350
The only prayer
I have to the Lord is that...

274
00:30:25,517 --> 00:30:29,683
the man you marry must
love you even more than I do.

275
00:30:30,392 --> 00:30:31,350
C'mon...

276
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:33,892
I don't think such
a man exists in this world...

277
00:30:34,392 --> 00:30:35,350
Am I not there?

278
00:30:37,683 --> 00:30:40,350
You did not eat, dance or even talk
to anyone at the party tonight.

279
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,600
You didn't even tell me
how beautiful I look tonight.

280
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,350
You look very beautiful, Naina.

281
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,350
Really? How sweet!

282
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,558
I'm sweet and I also lie very well.

283
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,558
Just go...
- No.

284
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:54,558
Hey Naina, you look very beautiful.

285
00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:57,017
Are you lying or telling the truth?
- What do you think?

286
00:30:58,058 --> 00:30:59,683
I think...
- What do you think?

287
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:01,517
I think Rahul...
- What do you think?

288
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,475
Rahul, I think you should go now.

289
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:06,017
In any case I wasn't planning to come
with you. But thanks for the offer.

290
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:12,683
Bye... I was lying to you.

291
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:28,933
What's happening, Mom?

292
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:33,267
Nothing much except planning
for Dad's surprise party.

293
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:38,183
Nothing stays in
this child's stomach.

294
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,267
That's because there's already
so much in there.

295
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:44,017
Rahul, How come you are
back so early?

296
00:31:44,308 --> 00:31:46,767
Mom... These society parties are
very boring.

297
00:31:47,142 --> 00:31:48,058
Really?

298
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,933
In that case you have not taken
after your father in these matters.

299
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:54,808
He used to love such parties...

300
00:31:56,225 --> 00:31:58,017
because there used to be
a lot of girls there...

301
00:31:59,392 --> 00:32:00,392
Nandini

302
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,933
He used to get very happy
watching those girls.

303
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:07,767
Nandiniji... lf I hadn't
watched those beautiful girls...

304
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:10,392
how would I have found you?
- What did you do?

305
00:32:11,392 --> 00:32:13,350
Your father brought
Nandini's proposal...

306
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:18,225
When he saw her for the first time
he was very pleased...

307
00:32:19,725 --> 00:32:22,683
And said, he approved of her.

308
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:25,933
But he said we would have
to ask for dowry.

309
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:29,892
He insisted that the girl should
bring from her parents' house...

310
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:33,350
lots of love and a long,
long ladder.

311
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:38,183
It's a great tradition.

312
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:40,725
The elders of the house choose
their daughter-in-law.

313
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,225
One can't trust these mad children.

314
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:47,683
No, Mataji... All that was then.

315
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,017
These days everything has changed.
- Nothing has changed, Nandini.

316
00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:54,892
But these days children make
their choices themselves...

317
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:56,725
Nothing has changed, Nandini.

318
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,892
What I meant was...
- Nothing has changed.

319
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:02,142
But...
- I said it... didn't I?

320
00:33:02,975 --> 00:33:04,350
That's it!

321
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:20,142
Your beauty is going to steal
his sleep in the nights...

322
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,308
Shut up!
- You shut up!

323
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:23,975
Where is your Ashfaque?

324
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,725
I haven't even seen him yet.

325
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:27,933
Introduce him to me.
Let me see how he looks.

326
00:33:28,183 --> 00:33:29,933
He is arriving from
Lucknow today and...

327
00:33:30,183 --> 00:33:32,142
he will come to meet you
as soon as he comes.

328
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,308
Tell me what you thought of him.

329
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:36,142
Stop this coy bride act now...

330
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:37,933
By the way,
what does he do in Lucknow?

331
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,850
He is a poet.
- A poet?

332
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:41,933
Then I'll get
along very well with him.

333
00:33:42,183 --> 00:33:43,808
Really? Why?

334
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:46,808
That's because I write
a bit of poetry myself.

335
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,933
A ha... Ustad Anjali Ali Khan.

336
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:53,933
Let me say a few lines...
- Go on... Go on.

337
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:56,642
What heartache have
I gone through for thee...

338
00:33:58,392 --> 00:34:00,350
What heartache have
I gone through for thee...

339
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:02,892
On one end is Rukhsar and
the other is Aunteee...

340
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:04,558
Shut up, you brat.

341
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:08,058
Do you know that the morning papers
have carried a photograph...

342
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:10,683
- of my boss and his son?
- Really? Can I see?

343
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,558
Wash your hands first...
- Oh God!

344
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:16,642
Tomorrow is his fiftieth birthday.

345
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:19,142
There's going to be a big party.
There will be lot of people.

346
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,058
I made it very clear to Bhabhiji
that the desserts will...

347
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:26,058
come from Chandni Chowk. That too
specially made by dear Anjali.

348
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,683
Really? And what did she say?
- She agreed.

349
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,808
But now you make sure that
you don't mess things up.

350
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,183
Both Rukhsar and you come to
the party with the kulfi.

351
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:36,225
Yes we will. Oh God, but
tomorrow is Bauji's birthday too.

352
00:34:36,892 --> 00:34:38,517
So what? Come a little late.

353
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:40,892
In any case their party is
not going to start early.

354
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:43,517
Oh Allah! Oh Allah!
Do I have it?

355
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,558
No!
- You don't know anything.

356
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:49,058
Please dress appropriately
for tomorrow.

357
00:34:49,517 --> 00:34:52,058
Yes Ammi, I will wear my new
shimmering, embroidered outfit.

358
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:53,892
Of course... You must.

359
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,725
After all everyone in the party
will be dying to know...

360
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:58,350
what Rukhsar is going to wear...
- Really?

361
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,725
C'mon Rukhsar... the gang... Please.
- No... not today.

362
00:35:03,058 --> 00:35:05,183
Rukhsar please.
- No... Ammi is not feeling well.

363
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:15,683
I'll return it.

364
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:19,017
Your groom is coming
to visit us today, isn't he?

365
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:25,892
Where have we come now? How tacky!

366
00:35:26,183 --> 00:35:28,808
You brat. Mother has sent some
medicines for Daijaan.

367
00:35:29,058 --> 00:35:30,017
I'll back.

368
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:40,017
Ammi... Stop it now and
go to sleep...

369
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:50,725
Come back.
- Coming, bauji.

370
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:57,892
Where has Bhaiiya gone?

371
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:06,142
The shop's closed for now.
It will open only at 10.

372
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,475
Ashfaque miya.

373
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,142
Let me say a couplet.

374
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:30,058
So what if the evil wishes harm...
nothing can happen

375
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:37,017
The only will that triumphs
is the will of the Lord.

376
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:40,642
Your turn...

377
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,850
Eh, Look up there.

378
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:48,017
Eh, Laddoo...
You can't enter Chandni Chowk.

379
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,892
Why?
- Just...

380
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,892
And if you want to enter,
you have to say this:

381
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:55,225
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty on
a moonlit night in Chandni Chowk

382
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:57,517
in a silver spoon,
some Chatni... Say it fast.

383
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,142
What exactly am I supposed to say?

384
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:03,600
Never mind... You don't say...
Can I say another one?

385
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:11,975
Love is not an easy path,
understand ye all...

386
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:17,475
It's a trial by fire
to be crossed bravely.

387
00:38:21,267 --> 00:38:25,225
Chandu's... spoon's... uncle...

388
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:31,058
You have come to meet me...
haven't you?

389
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:36,225
Not really...
I came to meet Daijaan.

390
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,517
So you call her
'Daijaan' lovingly... eh?

391
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:43,808
Of course...
She has brought me up.

392
00:38:45,183 --> 00:38:47,350
She has brought you up?

393
00:38:48,767 --> 00:38:51,225
In that case even I must have been
your played in her lap.

394
00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:57,475
Chandu's spoon... silver uncle...
Look up there!

395
00:38:58,183 --> 00:38:59,475
Catch him.

396
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:01,517
When's the wedding?
- Who's?

397
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,142
Of course yours and hers.

398
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,892
How can I marry Daijaan?

399
00:39:08,517 --> 00:39:11,725
You have a great sense of humour.
And you are cute too.

400
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,475
Bhaiyya... save me.

401
00:39:14,642 --> 00:39:17,725
I'm going to tell Rukhsar that
I liked her Ashfaque miya.

402
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:22,392
Who is Ashfaque miya?

403
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:26,558
You are asking me
who Ashfaque miya is?

404
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:29,058
You have a great sense of humour...
You have a great sense of humour...

405
00:39:33,142 --> 00:39:35,100
Do you know where
Sayeeda begum lives? No?

406
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:39,183
Do you know?
- What do I know?

407
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:40,725
You seem to know everything.

408
00:39:41,017 --> 00:39:43,267
Do you know my Aunty?
Your would be mother-in-law...

409
00:39:43,517 --> 00:39:45,725
Sayeeda begum... Do you know
where she works?

410
00:39:46,683 --> 00:39:48,725
Big businesses of the big people.

411
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,475
Have you heard of the Raichands?
How could you have heard of them?

412
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:54,517
Their photo has appeared
in the newspaper today...

413
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,183
Really?
- Yes...

414
00:39:57,225 --> 00:39:58,558
Have you seen it?
- No...

415
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:00,725
Then come with me...
I'll show you...

416
00:40:01,183 --> 00:40:02,975
I don't read the newspapers.
- Here it is.

417
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:06,017
Yashvardhan Raichand...
a big snob!

418
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:11,475
And this is his son... God!
He looks exactly like you.

419
00:40:11,808 --> 00:40:16,058
Show me.
Ah Ashfaque miya.

420
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:20,725
I'm a dead duck...
- Not at all...

421
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:23,725
You have a great sense of humour.
You have a great sense of humour.

422
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:27,725
Bhaiyya... I have some
goons running after me.

423
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,017
My younger brother.

424
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:45,142
Listen... You really do have
a great sense of humour.

425
00:40:52,642 --> 00:40:55,600
Greetings... I'm Ashfaque.
- And I'm the Queen of Jhansi.

426
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:38,892
Before I raise
this toast to Papa...

427
00:41:39,225 --> 00:41:41,225
I want to say something
to all of you.

428
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:48,683
I had a dream since childhood...
A dream to be like Papa.

429
00:41:50,017 --> 00:41:52,308
To walk like him, speak like
him, sit like him...

430
00:41:52,725 --> 00:41:55,183
To do everything the way he does.

431
00:41:56,392 --> 00:41:58,600
Like the way he is
standing right now...

432
00:42:03,892 --> 00:42:05,892
Can't do it.
I know I can't do it.

433
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:10,392
And maybe I will never be able to
do it because...

434
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:13,017
there's no one in this world
like my Papa.

435
00:42:16,058 --> 00:42:22,267
I know that someone up there is
happy with me to have bestowed on...

436
00:42:22,475 --> 00:42:25,600
me the right to say that
I am Yashvardhan Raichand's son.

437
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:29,600
Say it proudly.

438
00:42:54,642 --> 00:42:58,850
We just want to say to you that
we love you very much.

439
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:16,267
I'll just have a look.
Grandmother, you come with me.

440
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:29,475
"Your gilded beauty shines through,
and so do your golden anklets"

441
00:44:29,892 --> 00:44:34,350
"They tinkle in melody,
to wound the hearts of millions"

442
00:44:35,017 --> 00:44:37,308
"Your kohled eyes speak
a mysterious language"

443
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:40,475
"the immortal language of love"

444
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,475
Say "shava shava"
friends say "shava shava"

445
00:45:06,933 --> 00:45:10,725
"My gilded beauty shines through,
and so do my golden anklets"

446
00:45:11,558 --> 00:45:15,517
"They tinkle in melody,
to wound the hearts of millions"

447
00:45:16,058 --> 00:45:18,392
"My kohled eyes speak
a mysterious language..."

448
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:21,392
"the immortal language of love"

449
00:45:23,517 --> 00:45:26,808
Say "shava shava"
friends say "shava shava"

450
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:37,350
"Ever since I laid my eyes
on you for the first time..."

451
00:46:37,725 --> 00:46:41,142
"my heart beats faster every minute"

452
00:46:41,517 --> 00:46:46,350
"What have you done to me?
Oh lord, what have you done to me?"

453
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:55,600
"Your sweet words
make me weak in my knees"

454
00:46:56,392 --> 00:46:58,267
"I think I'm falling
in love with you"

455
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:01,017
"I will die without you"

456
00:47:01,558 --> 00:47:06,267
"Oh God, I will die without you"

457
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:11,517
Say "shava shava" friends
Say "shava shava"

458
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:14,808
"May my last breath
be at your feet"

459
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,225
"May my love for you
surpass that of the lord"

460
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:21,225
"May the lord forgive me,
may the lord forgive me"

461
00:48:28,433 --> 00:48:31,683
"You are my heart,
you are my soul"

462
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:35,183
"You are my heaven,
you are my earth"

463
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:38,600
"What will I ever do without you"

464
00:48:39,058 --> 00:48:44,183
"Oh lord, what will
I ever do without you"

465
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:00,808
"Say " shava shava " friends
say "shava shava"

466
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:16,142

467
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,933

468
00:49:21,975 --> 00:49:23,933

469
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:27,142
"...the immortal language of love"

470
00:49:28,642 --> 00:49:32,350
"Say " shava shava " friends
say "shava shava"

471
00:50:32,558 --> 00:50:35,142
That's enough now.
It's been too much.

472
00:51:27,558 --> 00:51:30,058
God... Mad girl...
Come on now...

473
00:51:37,225 --> 00:51:39,475
I'm a dead duck...
I'm a dead duck...

474
00:51:45,517 --> 00:51:46,683
Rukhsar, This one is...

475
00:52:00,808 --> 00:52:02,017
Excuse me Sir!

476
00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:09,308
This is our Anjali.
She has come to apologise to you.

477
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:14,725
Apologise?
Oh... That's not necessary.

478
00:52:15,267 --> 00:52:16,475
Wait! Wait!

479
00:52:16,975 --> 00:52:19,142
How can you say that Sir? She has
caused such a big loss for us...

480
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:23,392
She must apologise. And to tell you,
she is quite a madcap.

481
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,392
Even in her own house...
- Aunty! Can I speak?

482
00:52:26,892 --> 00:52:28,517
Yes... go ahead... apologise.

483
00:52:33,058 --> 00:52:37,225
You know sir,
When I listen to film songs...

484
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,475
I tend to get a little filmi.

485
00:52:40,183 --> 00:52:43,142
And that Khandala number
is one of my favourites.

486
00:52:45,225 --> 00:52:47,350
Shut up!
- What am I saying?

487
00:52:47,725 --> 00:52:49,725
What did you want to say and
what are you saying?

488
00:52:52,058 --> 00:52:53,017
Apologise.

489
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:57,933
You?
Come on leave right now from here.

490
00:53:00,225 --> 00:53:02,683
Me?
- No... no... not you.

491
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:10,392
Oh! Sir, I was responsible for
smashing your big pot.

492
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,600
Vase.
- Yes, vase... shaz whatever it was.

493
00:53:12,975 --> 00:53:14,725
I'm ready to pay you the
money for it.

494
00:53:15,683 --> 00:53:17,350
By the way how much
was it for?

495
00:53:17,683 --> 00:53:20,558
Now... I don't know...
Sayeeda, Why don't you explain.

496
00:53:20,808 --> 00:53:23,267
Shut up!
- Shut up?

497
00:53:23,725 --> 00:53:25,933
This is all because of you.
- Because of me?

498
00:53:26,975 --> 00:53:32,933
No... no... not because of you.
God, everything is going wrong.

499
00:53:34,308 --> 00:53:36,517
You see sir...

500
00:53:36,892 --> 00:53:40,933
Bauji always says that no one becomes
small by asking for forgiveness.

501
00:53:41,975 --> 00:53:45,517
And the one who forgives
owns a big heart...

502
00:53:46,058 --> 00:53:48,933
You have a big heart don't you, Sir?
- Now...

503
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,308
So you have forgiven me?
- Yes... I have.

504
00:53:55,392 --> 00:53:58,600
Big businesses of big people.
Ok I'll take your leave now.

505
00:53:59,892 --> 00:54:01,600
Please say a big hello to Madam.

506
00:54:01,892 --> 00:54:03,892
May the Lord protect
Greetings. To you too!

507
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,142
Quiet now...

508
00:54:24,892 --> 00:54:29,850
Pot... No, Not a pot... a vase.

509
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,683
Sayeeda... Take her now...

510
00:54:32,058 --> 00:54:36,017
Come on now... Come on...
- Not a pot... a vase. Sorry.

511
00:54:43,892 --> 00:54:44,892
A pot!

512
00:54:47,308 --> 00:54:48,725
Isn't this that Laddoo's school?

513
00:54:49,058 --> 00:54:50,850
- C'mon lets go and hit him.
- Yes... C'mon.

514
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:07,517
These are the same goons
I was talking about.

515
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,517
Hey, you speak Hindi, don't you?

516
00:55:41,017 --> 00:55:42,267
What? And you didn't do anything?

517
00:55:42,475 --> 00:55:44,517
They were too many of them Didi...
I couldn't do anything.

518
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:48,225
Here you roam around like a don.
What happened to you there?

519
00:55:48,558 --> 00:55:50,392
Oh! Didi.
- Oh! Didi.

520
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:52,683
But what was the need for
her to go into the school?

521
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,600
Lord Almighty!
What are you saying?

522
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:57,600
She just entered the school...
not murdered anyone.

523
00:55:57,975 --> 00:55:59,725
What was the need for them
to say all those things?

524
00:55:59,933 --> 00:56:01,892
If I was there I would have caught
each one of them and bashed them up.

525
00:56:02,767 --> 00:56:05,058
Yes. They have hurt my sister.

526
00:56:05,517 --> 00:56:07,475
Let me meet that
Laddoo and that Fattoo...

527
00:56:09,725 --> 00:56:11,517
I vow on Sachin Tendulkar that
I don't hang them upside down...

528
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:14,058
in the middle of Chandni Chowk
I won't call myself Bauji's daughter.

529
00:56:14,308 --> 00:56:15,267
Anjali!

530
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:18,308
You don't know, Bauji...
Rich in money but poor at heart...

531
00:56:18,558 --> 00:56:20,017
Can never find place near the Lord...

532
00:56:21,433 --> 00:56:23,308
That's a good line.
Did you write it yourself?

533
00:56:23,558 --> 00:56:24,558
Yes.

534
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,475
Greetings to you.
- Greetings.

535
00:56:30,225 --> 00:56:32,475
Anjali, they have come to
our house for the first time...

536
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,725
Get them something to eat.

537
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,725
I'm sure they have had
their meals before coming...

538
00:56:36,933 --> 00:56:38,725
Haven't you seen the size?

539
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:42,392
Don't worry sir we have eaten.

540
00:56:42,767 --> 00:56:44,725
How can you say that? I'll just
get you something in a minute.

541
00:56:44,933 --> 00:56:47,183
No. No sir,
Please don't take any trouble.

542
00:56:47,642 --> 00:56:50,350
And you also... don't bother.

543
00:56:52,558 --> 00:56:54,267
What's the name?
- Rohan!

544
00:56:54,558 --> 00:56:55,850
Not yours, hers...
- Pooja...

545
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:57,558
You are a real Laddoo. Come on.

546
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,683
You must never hurt
anyone's feelings.

547
00:57:07,308 --> 00:57:09,058
Specially that of a young girl...
and not...

548
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:12,017
when she's so beautiful.
Come on, say Sorry now.

549
00:57:15,017 --> 00:57:16,975
Besides, Someone has told me that...

550
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,850
apologising doesn't make
anyone smaller.

551
00:57:20,392 --> 00:57:23,683
And the one who forgives
owns a big heart.

552
00:57:25,892 --> 00:57:27,183
Isn't it?

553
00:57:31,017 --> 00:57:32,975
What are you looking at?
C'mon, apologise, Laddoo.

554
00:57:46,725 --> 00:57:50,475
If those two can become friends,
why can't we?

555
00:57:50,808 --> 00:57:52,267
Friends?
- Yes...

556
00:57:52,475 --> 00:57:54,975
I just want to be friends with you...
Do you have a problem?

557
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:59,392
Really?
Friends, ji? C'mon just do it.

558
00:58:02,392 --> 00:58:04,475
I can't see Bauji...
He went to get some food...

559
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:06,058
Bauji is inside...

560
00:58:12,725 --> 00:58:16,683
I'm telling you, Rukhsar...
There's something fishy going on.

561
00:58:18,058 --> 00:58:19,767
Anjali, you think he's...
- What?

562
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:23,100
He is...
- Yes... even I think the same.

563
00:58:23,642 --> 00:58:25,267
Don't you think?
- Correct.

564
00:58:25,642 --> 00:58:28,600
Even you think the same, don't you?
- You are on the mark Rukhsar.

565
00:58:30,433 --> 00:58:32,600
He wants to take away
my shop from me.

566
00:58:32,975 --> 00:58:33,933
Oh Allah!

567
00:58:34,225 --> 00:58:37,392
What do I do with this girl?
I'm saying that he might be in...

568
00:58:37,642 --> 00:58:39,183
Iove with you...
- Love?

569
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:41,892
Wow, Rukhsar begum,
you are really great!

570
00:58:42,642 --> 00:58:44,308
You think all the girls in Delhi
that he will be in love with me?

571
00:58:46,142 --> 00:58:48,100
No one loves me
here in Chandni Chowk...

572
00:58:48,433 --> 00:58:50,600
Why would that Yashvardhan's
son be interested in me?

573
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:52,725
Don't joke it away now,
I'm telling you.

574
00:58:53,017 --> 00:58:54,975
Ya ya...
you keep telling...

575
00:59:03,558 --> 00:59:05,350
Take her away.
- What are you saying?

576
00:59:05,558 --> 00:59:07,267
It was a joke.
- Stop it.

577
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,558
So you don't want to
buy the sweetmeats?

578
00:59:12,558 --> 00:59:14,267
When did it shift?

579
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:16,183
Red Fort shifted to Agra
a long time ago and...

580
00:59:16,392 --> 00:59:18,142
the mental asylum from there
has shifted here.

581
00:59:18,558 --> 00:59:21,183
Not a dime in the pocket and wants to
know the whereabouts of the Red Fort.

582
00:59:25,975 --> 00:59:27,600
Bharat Sweet Shop.
Sweets for all occasions...

583
00:59:27,975 --> 00:59:30,517
whether an engagement or wedding.
- Both will happen in due course...

584
00:59:30,808 --> 00:59:32,225
what's the hurry?
- Who's that?

585
00:59:32,392 --> 00:59:34,683
Who? It's me, who else?
- Who's me?

586
00:59:35,058 --> 00:59:37,350
What do you mean, who?
It's me your new friend.

587
00:59:40,058 --> 00:59:43,017
You know, the children have made
a plan to go to the fair...

588
00:59:43,558 --> 00:59:46,058
I was thinking if you could join us,
it would be great fun!

589
00:59:46,308 --> 00:59:47,225
What fair?

590
00:59:47,392 --> 00:59:49,392
The fair at Chandni Chowk,
which else?

591
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,267
This fair?
Don't you think...

592
00:59:52,517 --> 00:59:54,725
its importance would reach too high
if you visited this fair?

593
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,808
Actually, my importance will increase
manifold, if you could join me.

594
00:59:59,517 --> 01:00:01,517
Tomorrow at 4 in the evening.

595
01:00:01,892 --> 01:00:03,517
Bye.
- Bye Shye.

596
01:00:14,558 --> 01:00:17,058
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty
on a moonlit night in

597
01:00:17,267 --> 01:00:19,225
Chandni Chowk in a silver spoon,
some Chatni. C'mon say it.

598
01:00:19,558 --> 01:00:20,725
Stop it!

599
01:00:24,392 --> 01:00:27,058
Wearing a suit and his boots
Kanhaiyya has arrived to play a band.

600
01:00:27,892 --> 01:00:29,517
Wow! You sing very well.

601
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,517
Yes... By the way,
do you always wear such clothes?

602
01:00:33,058 --> 01:00:35,350
Yes... When I wear clothes,
I wear these.

603
01:00:35,558 --> 01:00:37,350
Otherwise most of the time
I'm in the nude...

604
01:00:37,558 --> 01:00:39,850
No... no... I asked because
we have a proverb that says,

605
01:00:40,267 --> 01:00:42,350
'He who wears a kurta from
Lucknow and Pathani salwar...

606
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:44,850
stands for a true man and the one
who doesn't, who knows? '

607
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,350
Very good! By the way your hair
looks beautiful when left loose.

608
01:00:50,558 --> 01:00:53,725
Isn't it a coincidence that both
our fathers share the same birthday?

609
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:56,475
Twins?
- Of course. One with a large heart...

610
01:00:56,725 --> 01:00:58,683
the other with a large pocket
to pay the bills.

611
01:01:05,517 --> 01:01:07,475
Let them be.
They look nice.

612
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:16,475
Bangles? 'Fair are my wrists...
make me wear those green bangles... '

613
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:20,142
'... Make me yours, my beloved... '

614
01:01:21,517 --> 01:01:23,350
You... Sorry, I mean Mr...

615
01:01:23,558 --> 01:01:25,850
Ah! Don't be formal...
Say ‘you'... makes me feel closer.

616
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,892
Closer? This is getting too much...
Now listen to me Mr. Raichand...

617
01:01:31,517 --> 01:01:33,642
- I want to say something to you...
- I'm listening...

618
01:01:34,517 --> 01:01:38,475
What I want to say is that
I can't give you what you want.

619
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,183
Why not?
- I just can't.

620
01:01:41,517 --> 01:01:43,017
At least give it a try.

621
01:01:43,308 --> 01:01:45,225
I can't give...
Bauji won't allow it...

622
01:01:45,517 --> 01:01:46,975
I'll ask for it from Bauji...

623
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:49,475
Lord save me! Why would
Bauji give you our shop?

624
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:53,058
What's the big...? Shop?
What shop?

625
01:01:53,767 --> 01:01:56,683
Our Bharat Sweetmeat shop, which else?
- What shop are you talking about?

626
01:01:57,433 --> 01:01:59,725
It was alright till friendship but
what is all this intimacy about?

627
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:03,558
You sneaked into my house.
Lord save me, even that is over.

628
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:05,892
After all there's a limit
to friendship, isn't there?

629
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:09,392
Shut up!

630
01:02:11,892 --> 01:02:13,850
There are many bonds
other than friendship.

631
01:02:15,225 --> 01:02:19,392
Bonds that we don't understand...
that we don't need to understand.

632
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,725
I hope it's not hurting you.

633
01:02:23,892 --> 01:02:27,558
Bonds that are nameless...
that are just to be experienced.

634
01:02:29,558 --> 01:02:31,183
I hope it's not hurting you.

635
01:02:32,225 --> 01:02:34,392
Bonds that don't
have any boundaries...

636
01:02:34,933 --> 01:02:38,392
no limits.
I hope it's not hurting you.

637
01:02:40,433 --> 01:02:43,392
Bonds that bind the
hearts together...

638
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:47,642
bonds of passion...
bonds of love.

639
01:02:51,433 --> 01:02:56,683
Hurt you? Me too!

640
01:03:01,392 --> 01:03:03,350
And one more thing...

641
01:03:03,725 --> 01:03:07,350
I'm definitely going to
take over your sweetmeat shop!

642
01:03:42,058 --> 01:03:44,017
"The sun dims into twilight"

643
01:03:44,725 --> 01:03:47,017
"The moon beams simmer brightly"

644
01:04:12,308 --> 01:04:16,267
"I stand still as the earth
moves around me"

645
01:04:18,308 --> 01:04:22,267
"The heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper"

646
01:04:23,558 --> 01:04:28,267
"Is it the call of first love?"

647
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:35,600
"My love, is it the
call of first love?"

648
01:04:49,308 --> 01:04:54,267
"The sun dims into twilight,
moon beams simmer brightly"

649
01:05:01,683 --> 01:05:06,642
"I stand still as the earth
moves around me"

650
01:05:07,892 --> 01:05:12,183
"The heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper"

651
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:18,017
"Is it the call of first love?"

652
01:05:19,058 --> 01:05:25,183
"My love, is it the call
of first love?"

653
01:06:07,225 --> 01:06:12,392
"Savour these beauteous moments,
when everything changes"

654
01:06:12,725 --> 01:06:17,475
"Our dreams blend into
the realms of reality"

655
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:24,558
"I wonder if our love,
travelling through centuries..."

656
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:30,142
"has bound us in its silken threads"

657
01:06:31,558 --> 01:06:36,517
"Let this season of love
remain eternal"

658
01:06:37,308 --> 01:06:42,600
"let us meet through lives
and lives, like today"

659
01:06:43,975 --> 01:06:47,517
"I stand still as the earth
moves around me"

660
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:54,142
"the heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper"

661
01:06:54,725 --> 01:07:00,058
"Is it the call of first love?"

662
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:07,475
"My love, is it the call
of first love?"

663
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:58,017
"The colours of our souls
has melted into one"

664
01:08:00,058 --> 01:08:07,017
"I can't say which of me is you
and which of you is me"

665
01:08:09,058 --> 01:08:16,017
"O beloved, it's the waves
of the your love that drown me"

666
01:08:17,058 --> 01:08:21,975
"before transporting me to the shore"

667
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:28,975
"It's the thirst of the ocean,
It's the dream of the night"

668
01:08:29,975 --> 01:08:35,017
"The hearts of the flames
have been set afire"

669
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:41,308
"I stand still
as the earth moves around me"

670
01:08:42,475 --> 01:08:47,017
"the heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper"

671
01:08:48,392 --> 01:08:52,308
"My love, is it the
call of first love?"

672
01:08:53,558 --> 01:08:59,933
"My love, is it
the call of first love?"

673
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:06,600
"The sun dims into twilight,
moon beams simmer brightly"

674
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,725
She's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely mad.

675
01:10:16,683 --> 01:10:19,933
She makes strange faces,
she talks a lot.

676
01:10:20,975 --> 01:10:23,933
And she has some lovable mannerisms.

677
01:10:24,975 --> 01:10:27,933
And wherever she goes
she breaks a vase a pot

678
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:30,350
Pot?
- That's what she calls them.

679
01:10:31,725 --> 01:10:34,267
But whenever I'm next to her,
I don't know what happens to me.

680
01:10:37,725 --> 01:10:40,683
But she's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely...

681
01:10:40,892 --> 01:10:41,933
Mad.

682
01:10:44,975 --> 01:10:46,725
What's the name
of this mad hatter?

683
01:10:50,975 --> 01:10:52,433
I wanted to know your opinion.

684
01:10:52,642 --> 01:10:56,058
I'm very happy with this alliance.
Naina is a very nice girl.

685
01:10:56,642 --> 01:10:58,433
Have you spoken to Rahul
about this?

686
01:10:58,642 --> 01:11:01,600
What's the need to speak to Rahul?
He can't take these family decisions.

687
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:05,850
Naina will be the daughter-in-law
of this house... our house!

688
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,267
DJ... Who will do all
this for me there?

689
01:11:33,892 --> 01:11:36,892
Dad, Why can't I stay with
all of you here?

690
01:11:37,975 --> 01:11:40,183
Why are you sending me
to the boarding school?

691
01:11:41,725 --> 01:11:43,683
Traditions, my child...
traditions...

692
01:11:44,725 --> 01:11:47,350
Your grandfather went there,
I did, so did bhaiyya.

693
01:11:48,683 --> 01:11:50,142
You can't break the traditions
of the house, can you?

694
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:51,308
No...

695
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:05,808
Always remember
one more thing...

696
01:12:06,433 --> 01:12:08,058
Mom loves me more than
she loves you.

697
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:32,475
You have given me so much already...
I can't take all these.

698
01:12:32,725 --> 01:12:36,475
Sayeeda... If Rahul and Rohan
can be like your sons...

699
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:38,808
then don't have a right
over your daughter?

700
01:12:39,142 --> 01:12:41,600
Of course you have...
But all this is too much...

701
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,558
Just tell me what time
is the actual wedding?

702
01:12:48,558 --> 01:12:50,558
Rohan... listen to me carefully.

703
01:12:54,017 --> 01:12:55,517
Take care of your food and sleep.

704
01:12:56,017 --> 01:12:57,725
Rohan, he has reached
his school.

705
01:12:58,433 --> 01:13:00,392
Hey! What's all this?

706
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,058
Tomorrow is Rukhsar's wedding...
So the two of us...

707
01:13:03,433 --> 01:13:05,600
Congratulations to you Sayeeda!

708
01:13:05,892 --> 01:13:08,475
If you need anything just ask for it
- Thank you sir...

709
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:10,892
I'd be very happy if you and bhabhiji
could attend the wedding tomorrow...

710
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,392
I have asked Rahul to attend the
wedding, he will be there.

711
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,100
Ok.

712
01:13:22,058 --> 01:13:23,725
Rahul baba must have come now...

713
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:25,725
Let me just check.
I'll just be back.

714
01:13:38,142 --> 01:13:39,725
Listen to me.

715
01:13:42,767 --> 01:13:44,517
Tomorrow is a big day for Sayeeda.

716
01:13:44,892 --> 01:13:48,808
I think we should go too...
- How can we go there, Nandini?

717
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:54,725
I can understand... But still we...
- We cannot go there.

718
01:13:56,517 --> 01:14:01,058
Please think about it again...
- I said it, didn't I? That's it!

719
01:14:36,058 --> 01:14:38,017
Eh! What happened to Chandni?

720
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:43,183
Haldiram, What happened?
- What happened?

721
01:15:02,642 --> 01:15:05,933
Listen... let me say a couplet.

722
01:15:07,225 --> 01:15:09,767
'Kurta from Lucknow or a pathani salwar
does not make a man...

723
01:15:10,517 --> 01:15:12,267
He who gives away his
heart stands for a true man...

724
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:14,267
and the one who doesn't...
who knows? '

725
01:15:27,642 --> 01:15:29,350
"Oh the brides decorated hands"

726
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,767
"Oh the brides bejewelled finery"

727
01:15:32,392 --> 01:15:35,100
"Oh she looks like a floral ornament"

728
01:15:36,892 --> 01:15:38,600
"Oh the brides kohled eyes"

729
01:15:39,392 --> 01:15:40,933
"Oh she looks the
most beautiful of them all"

730
01:16:03,808 --> 01:16:05,933
"Oh the bridesmaid..."

731
01:16:06,225 --> 01:16:08,225
"She looks like a silken thread"

732
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:14,850
"she peeps from behind,
and steals a glance"

733
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:31,267
"Whether she admits it or nay,
she's stolen my heart"

734
01:16:31,725 --> 01:16:33,517
"Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord"

735
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,892
"These lanes of my childhood,
I shall never depart"

736
01:16:50,183 --> 01:16:53,517
"Put some sense,
into this crazy man's head"

737
01:17:04,017 --> 01:17:07,892
"He is hurling himself onto me"

738
01:17:08,308 --> 01:17:10,475
"Oh lord, this young man oh my lord"

739
01:17:40,517 --> 01:17:42,475
"Whether thy lips speak or not..."

740
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,808
"your eyes divulge the story"

741
01:17:45,517 --> 01:17:49,475
"You can't hide love in disdain..."

742
01:17:50,225 --> 01:17:53,642
"you can't hide love in disdain..."

743
01:17:54,517 --> 01:17:58,558
"A veiled silence speaks
more than a thousand words"

744
01:17:59,433 --> 01:18:03,392
"Words don't always
do justice, my friend"

745
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,142
"What's in the heart,
only the heart knows"

746
01:18:06,392 --> 01:18:07,892
"Or then the lord"

747
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:11,850
"Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord"

748
01:18:13,142 --> 01:18:16,767
"Oh my lord,
this young man, oh my lord"

749
01:18:52,225 --> 01:18:56,517
"You can't demand,
a hand in betrothal"

750
01:18:57,267 --> 01:19:01,308
"pairs are ordained,
already in heaven"

751
01:19:01,767 --> 01:19:05,350
"Pairs are ordained,
already in heaven"

752
01:19:06,058 --> 01:19:10,350
"Leading a wedding procession,
I will take you from your doorstep"

753
01:19:11,058 --> 01:19:15,350
"It's been destined so,
"Oh go away and stop day dreaming"

754
01:19:19,975 --> 01:19:23,642
"Oh my lord,
this young man, oh my lord"

755
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:32,850
"Oh the bridesmaid...
she looks like a silken thread"

756
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:37,725
"She peeps from behind,
and steals a glance"

757
01:19:47,725 --> 01:19:51,933
"Whether she admits it or nay,
she's stolen my heart"

758
01:19:54,642 --> 01:19:58,350
"Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord"

759
01:19:59,225 --> 01:20:03,058
"Oh lord,
this young man oh my lord"

760
01:20:03,725 --> 01:20:07,350
"Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord"

761
01:20:10,267 --> 01:20:11,517
Agreed!

762
01:20:14,642 --> 01:20:15,600
Agreed!

763
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,142
Agreed!
- Even I agree.

764
01:20:41,933 --> 01:20:44,600
You love her don't you?
- Yes, Papa.

765
01:20:45,725 --> 01:20:47,350
Didn't I tell you, Nandini?
What did I tell you?

766
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:52,350
I'm very happy,
today Rahul... very happy.

767
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,058
Just promise me that
you will keep her happy too.

768
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:56,142
You will keep my daughter-in-law
very happy.

769
01:20:57,392 --> 01:20:59,267
You will keep Naina very happy.

770
01:21:23,308 --> 01:21:25,267
You face has fallen as
if we are already married.

771
01:21:26,683 --> 01:21:28,975
By the way this expression appears
only after a man gets married.

772
01:21:32,392 --> 01:21:35,267
Eh Rahul, What's the matter?

773
01:21:37,308 --> 01:21:39,017
What's her name?

774
01:21:39,683 --> 01:21:40,850
Naina!

775
01:21:42,225 --> 01:21:45,017
I wish that was the name.
But it isn't.

776
01:21:49,642 --> 01:21:51,267
Naina... it's just...
- Rahul!

777
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:56,183
Ever since I can remember
I have loved you...

778
01:21:56,558 --> 01:22:01,183
Loved you very much.
But it isn't your fault.

779
01:22:03,225 --> 01:22:08,100
Just because I dreamt of marrying you
doesn't mean you have to marry me.

780
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:13,017
And if you are worried
that I will miserable...

781
01:22:13,433 --> 01:22:14,975
yes I will be.

782
01:22:15,308 --> 01:22:16,975
I will feel very bad...
it will hurt

783
01:22:17,225 --> 01:22:21,183
a lot too.
But life doesn't stop, does it Rahul?

784
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,183
Perhaps a few years from now
I can laugh at the fact that...

785
01:22:27,975 --> 01:22:31,933
I loved a certain Rahul
who could not become mine.

786
01:22:33,225 --> 01:22:38,850
Because he was never mine!
And my love story remained incomplete.

787
01:22:43,517 --> 01:22:45,183
But do me a favour Rahul.

788
01:22:48,225 --> 01:22:50,225
Please complete your love story.

789
01:22:52,308 --> 01:22:54,808
You will, won't you Rahul?
For my sake.

790
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:03,142
Now say something quickly
before I cry more.

791
01:23:05,183 --> 01:23:06,475
Even me.

792
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:30,142
Raichand.

793
01:23:34,308 --> 01:23:38,392
The name and the respect has been
given to us by our ancestors.

794
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:46,475
To honour and respect
them is our foremost duty.

795
01:23:49,058 --> 01:23:54,808
And I will never tolerate
an ordinary girl becoming a hurdle...

796
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,058
in performing that duty.

797
01:24:00,392 --> 01:24:02,850
You didn't even think once...

798
01:24:04,725 --> 01:24:10,475
about the background of the girl,
her status... her breeding.

799
01:24:13,058 --> 01:24:15,850
You didn't give a thought to whether
the girl will be able to understand...

800
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:17,725
our culture... our traditions.

801
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:21,892
Will the girl ever understand
our rituals... our rites?

802
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,850
Will the girl understand our
ethics and principles?

803
01:24:27,850 --> 01:24:29,725
Will she adhere to
the values of our family?

804
01:24:29,975 --> 01:24:31,058
Will she...?

805
01:24:33,475 --> 01:24:37,433
How did you even dare to think
that she can be a part of our family?

806
01:24:39,433 --> 01:24:42,308
That she can be a
part of my family?

807
01:24:45,267 --> 01:24:47,058
How did you think?

808
01:24:50,683 --> 01:24:55,017
Where did I think, Papa?
I didn't think at all.

809
01:24:58,058 --> 01:25:03,350
I just loved... love.

810
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,267
Love?

811
01:25:14,058 --> 01:25:18,350
It's such a pity that. I made
a mistake in knowing my own son

812
01:25:22,058 --> 01:25:24,017
I thought he knew me.

813
01:25:26,642 --> 01:25:28,600
That he understands
the traditions of this family.

814
01:25:29,058 --> 01:25:31,725
He understands my emotions...
he understands every breath of mine.

815
01:25:37,058 --> 01:25:42,683
I was so wrong... so wrong.

816
01:25:49,767 --> 01:25:51,725
I was really proud of you.

817
01:25:52,392 --> 01:25:54,933
You were my self-respect.
You were my strength.

818
01:25:59,558 --> 01:26:05,933
You have taken all that away
from me... everything.

819
01:26:11,558 --> 01:26:13,142
You have hurt me,

820
01:26:17,975 --> 01:26:19,725
You have hurt me.

821
01:26:51,975 --> 01:26:53,933
I never wanted to hurt you.

822
01:26:57,225 --> 01:26:59,225
I only wanted to bring you happiness.

823
01:27:01,892 --> 01:27:03,892
What have I done?

824
01:27:07,558 --> 01:27:09,558
How could I bring tears to your eyes?

825
01:27:11,725 --> 01:27:13,517
How could I bring tears?

826
01:27:16,558 --> 01:27:18,392
Don't ever forgive me.

827
01:27:21,225 --> 01:27:23,683
Please don't say that
I have hurt you.

828
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:27,600
Don't forgive me.

829
01:27:29,892 --> 01:27:32,517
I will do as you say
just as you say.

830
01:28:22,225 --> 01:28:23,808
Bauji... Bauji...

831
01:28:24,183 --> 01:28:27,142
Please don't leave us and go.

832
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:31,225
Get up Bauji...
Don't leave us, Bauji...

833
01:29:07,433 --> 01:29:09,392
Will the girl be able to understand
our culture, our traditions.

834
01:29:10,225 --> 01:29:12,308
Will the girl ever understand our
rituals... our rites?

835
01:29:12,558 --> 01:29:14,725
Will the girl understand
our ethics and principles?

836
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,058
Will she adhere to
the values of our family?

837
01:30:55,725 --> 01:30:57,058
Today...

838
01:31:03,725 --> 01:31:09,142
today you have proved that
you are not my blood.

839
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,058
You are not my blood.

840
01:31:32,892 --> 01:31:42,683
You have proved that
you are not mine.

841
01:31:46,517 --> 01:31:47,475
Papa!

842
01:31:49,767 --> 01:31:51,892
You have lost the right
to call me that!

843
01:31:59,642 --> 01:32:07,350
Made me a stranger in a moment.
Made me a stranger in just a moment.

844
01:32:39,975 --> 01:32:42,267
Does that mean I have no
place in this house anymore?

845
01:33:39,892 --> 01:33:41,850
I am right... am I not, mother?

846
01:33:49,558 --> 01:33:51,558
I'm right, am I not?

847
01:33:57,517 --> 01:34:03,933
Then let me go... Can I go?

848
01:34:10,517 --> 01:34:13,183
"Through smiles or through tears"

849
01:34:14,183 --> 01:34:20,808
"We shall never part,
through smiles nor through tears"

850
01:34:58,225 --> 01:35:03,392
"My blessings live with you..."

851
01:35:04,142 --> 01:35:09,392
"to protect you from evil eyes"

852
01:35:10,683 --> 01:35:15,392
"My wishes for you..."

853
01:35:16,725 --> 01:35:19,683
"wherever you go"

854
01:35:22,433 --> 01:35:27,725
"May happiness and joy,
kiss your feet forever"

855
01:35:28,517 --> 01:35:31,142
"It's all your blessings"

856
01:35:31,767 --> 01:35:37,058
"Whether smiles or tears,
we shall never part"

857
01:35:37,725 --> 01:35:41,058
"through smiles or through tears"

858
01:36:11,058 --> 01:36:18,350
Promise me that you will never let
tears come to his eyes... promise me.

859
01:36:32,725 --> 01:36:34,017
Now go!

860
01:36:38,725 --> 01:36:40,308
Rahul... we didn't take
blessings from father.

861
01:36:41,725 --> 01:36:46,350
We don't have father's blessings...
Rahul we didn't...

862
01:37:07,017 --> 01:37:10,267
Go Sayeeda.
Go with my son.

863
01:37:11,725 --> 01:37:13,267
Wherever he goes...

864
01:37:15,308 --> 01:37:18,017
I don't want him to miss the warmth
of a mother's affection.

865
01:37:19,725 --> 01:37:22,850
If you want to be someone in life...
if you want to achieve something...

866
01:37:23,308 --> 01:37:26,267
if you want to win,
always listen to your heart.

867
01:37:28,392 --> 01:37:31,267
And if even that doesn't
give you any answers...

868
01:37:31,642 --> 01:37:36,267
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

869
01:37:38,058 --> 01:37:44,850
And then you will cross all the hurdles
all your problems will vanish.

870
01:37:46,308 --> 01:37:48,767
Victory will be yours.
Only yours.

871
01:37:52,308 --> 01:37:54,183
You will remember all this,
won't you Rohan?

872
01:37:54,642 --> 01:37:59,392
Why are you going, Bhaiyya?
Why? Please don't go.

873
01:38:02,267 --> 01:38:07,850
Promise me Rohan that after today
you will never ask anyone...

874
01:38:08,225 --> 01:38:10,600
why I left and where I went...
promise me.

875
01:38:21,892 --> 01:38:23,517
Take care of mother.

876
01:38:27,225 --> 01:38:29,183
Get selected in the cricket team.

877
01:38:46,975 --> 01:38:49,933
And thus Yash's ego and
Rahul's stubborn stand broke...

878
01:38:50,975 --> 01:38:55,600
the family into two...
broke the family into two...

879
01:40:38,183 --> 01:40:42,142
I will bring you back Bhaiyya.
I will bring you home Bhabhi.

880
01:40:43,183 --> 01:40:45,642
To your home... our home.

881
01:41:03,283 --> 01:41:04,617
Nandini...
- Yes?

882
01:41:08,367 --> 01:41:10,658
You have forgotten me
as soon as your son has arrived.

883
01:41:37,533 --> 01:41:39,658
Where is Rohan?

884
01:41:40,492 --> 01:41:42,450
I don't know where he
left early this morning.

885
01:41:42,617 --> 01:41:45,950
Greetings for Id.
- Greetings for Id.

886
01:41:46,283 --> 01:41:49,658
Greetings to you too.
Wow... you are glowing.

887
01:41:50,033 --> 01:41:51,950
I feel so happy that you have come.
Greetings for Id.

888
01:41:52,283 --> 01:41:54,908
God! How big he has grown.
- Yes... Both have grown quite a lot.

889
01:41:55,283 --> 01:41:56,783
Stop it now...
- Just a joke.

890
01:41:57,117 --> 01:41:58,908
What's his name, Haldiram?
- Ghasitaram!

891
01:41:59,242 --> 01:42:04,533
Hello! Salutations.
Greetings for Id.

892
01:42:04,908 --> 01:42:07,200
Greetings to you too.
- Recognise me?

893
01:42:10,367 --> 01:42:13,533
Well...
- I'm from... there.

894
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:15,367
Ok... yes yes.

895
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:18,450
He's just spinning yarns. He's just
come to have some free drinks.

896
01:42:21,492 --> 01:42:24,575
I don't seem to see your mother.
- That reminds me...

897
01:42:24,992 --> 01:42:26,992
What's the news about Anjali?
- They are all very well.

898
01:42:27,367 --> 01:42:30,200
I just spoke to them in the morning.
- Please give them lots of our love.

899
01:42:30,575 --> 01:42:33,992
Rukhsar!
- You all chat... I’ll be back.

900
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:39,992
What a life Anjali is leading!
From Chandni Chowk to...

901
01:42:40,908 --> 01:42:43,867
Yes. From Chandni Chowk to...?
- To...

902
01:42:44,242 --> 01:42:45,908
To... where?
- What where? Chandni Chowk?

903
01:42:46,242 --> 01:42:48,200
That's in Delhi.
- You said she went somewhere.

904
01:42:48,575 --> 01:42:51,950
Where did she go?
- Brother... Where she went?

905
01:42:52,367 --> 01:42:55,992
Where did she go?
- Where did she go? Where she went...

906
01:42:56,658 --> 01:42:58,450
Where did she go?
- Where did she go?

907
01:42:58,867 --> 01:43:01,117
Where- did- they- go?
- Where-did-they-go?

908
01:43:01,492 --> 01:43:03,950
Didn't you say they went somewhere?
Probably America or somewhere...

909
01:43:04,283 --> 01:43:06,783
Oh! Have they gone to America?

910
01:43:07,908 --> 01:43:10,450
But they didn't live there earlier.
- Exactly.

911
01:43:10,908 --> 01:43:12,617
Where did they live earlier?
- In Chandni Chowk.

912
01:43:12,992 --> 01:43:15,617
After that... Where?
- America... Didn't you just say?

913
01:43:16,033 --> 01:43:17,950
And in between?
- In between whom?

914
01:43:18,183 --> 01:43:20,017
In between the two...
- What is between the two?

915
01:43:20,392 --> 01:43:22,808
What is between the two?
- The place between the two...

916
01:43:23,183 --> 01:43:25,142
What's the place between the two?
What is he talking about?

917
01:43:25,517 --> 01:43:28,683
Wonder where these people come from.
- I'm trying to tell you, the place...

918
01:43:29,058 --> 01:43:31,183
What place are you talking about?
- What place? Where?

919
01:43:31,558 --> 01:43:33,225
Silence! Come here.

920
01:43:36,058 --> 01:43:37,683
Haldiram has lost his marbles.

921
01:43:38,058 --> 01:43:41,017
She has gone to London.
Someday even I will go there.

922
01:43:53,058 --> 01:43:54,808
You have just come back, son.
And you want to go away again?

923
01:43:55,058 --> 01:43:56,600
I feel incomplete here, Dad!

924
01:43:56,975 --> 01:44:00,933
Why don't you study for MBA here?
There are a lot of universities here.

925
01:44:01,975 --> 01:44:05,933
Why do you want to go to London?
- Traditions, Dad... Traditions.

926
01:44:07,975 --> 01:44:10,600
Grandfather went there, you did...

927
01:44:11,975 --> 01:44:16,183
So did Bhaiyya... So how can I break
the traditions of this house?

928
01:44:34,933 --> 01:44:36,892
So what shall I bring
back for the mother?

929
01:44:38,558 --> 01:44:40,308
What does a mother's heart yearn for?

930
01:44:42,558 --> 01:44:46,517
Mother's heart? It only yearns
for her son's happiness...

931
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:54,850
no matter where he is... no matter
how he is... just happiness...

932
01:45:06,725 --> 01:45:13,225
And a son's happiness is in
his mother's laughter... her smile...

933
01:45:15,475 --> 01:45:17,767
something that he
isn't able to see.

934
01:45:22,558 --> 01:45:26,767
I promise, mother.
The laughter will return...

935
01:45:28,558 --> 01:45:34,142
that smile will return.
It's a son's promise.

936
01:45:40,225 --> 01:45:41,892
And a brother's!

937
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,892
Your heart aches when your dear ones
go far distances, doesn't it?

938
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:19,558
And when dear ones create distances
in between, it aches even more.

939
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:51,392
Has your princess woken up?
- Oh yes... Pooja!

940
01:49:52,225 --> 01:49:55,183
No one knows her by that name. Call
her what she is called by everyone...

941
01:49:55,767 --> 01:49:56,892
Poo!

942
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:53,308
You have no right to
look so beautiful.

943
01:51:01,933 --> 01:51:03,892
She has arrived, the cunning vixen,
to drop her daughter.

944
01:51:05,142 --> 01:51:07,600
After seeing your face in the morning
how can I call it a lovely day?

945
01:51:13,725 --> 01:51:16,100
Liar! Liar! Come here...

946
01:51:21,558 --> 01:51:24,100
Who is it, Anjali?
- Your future daughter-in-law.

947
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:26,808
Come, let me serve you
some cornflakes.

948
01:51:47,142 --> 01:51:49,433
Anjali... Anjali I need to talk to you.
- What?

949
01:51:50,267 --> 01:51:52,558
This song that you sing every morning.
- So?

950
01:51:54,142 --> 01:51:55,683
It feels very nice.

951
01:51:58,058 --> 01:52:01,517
But the neighbours around
were complaining.

952
01:52:01,892 --> 01:52:05,058
I don't sing for them do I? I sing so
that my son learns about our country.

953
01:52:05,808 --> 01:52:08,517
Our Krish has learnt everything.
Say that you have!

954
01:52:08,892 --> 01:52:10,850
Yes... I have learnt everything.
- He has learnt nothing...

955
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:13,392
he knows nothing about our country.
Our religion, our traditions...

956
01:52:13,725 --> 01:52:16,558
our heritage... Move out of my way.
Our country has...

957
01:52:16,933 --> 01:52:18,850
Oh stop it Mummy!
What country? Country!

958
01:52:19,058 --> 01:52:22,058
Eh! The country best in the world
is our India... don't ever forget!

959
01:52:25,767 --> 01:52:28,850
OK... I won't say anything.
He's already half an Englishman...

960
01:52:29,225 --> 01:52:31,433
when he turns a full one
don't complain to me.

961
01:52:33,850 --> 01:52:38,350
Yes... become just like her!
How do they say it? How do they talk?

962
01:52:53,558 --> 01:52:55,683
Wouldn't it have been better
to have lived in Chandni Chowk?

963
01:53:12,017 --> 01:53:14,267
Let me knot it for you, Jeej!
- Aaaah!

964
01:53:17,017 --> 01:53:20,475
What happened?
- What kind of clothes have you worn?

965
01:53:21,017 --> 01:53:22,975
It's become too long hasn't it?

966
01:53:26,017 --> 01:53:27,183
What now?

967
01:53:30,725 --> 01:53:32,308
Where's the back?

968
01:53:33,183 --> 01:53:35,100
Didi, don't wait for me.

969
01:53:43,808 --> 01:53:46,142
Anjali, Daijaan, come here.

970
01:53:46,517 --> 01:53:49,642
How do you allow Pooja to
go out wearing such little clothes?

971
01:54:09,725 --> 01:54:12,017
By the way even the two of you
are looking decent today, I think...

972
01:54:58,642 --> 01:55:00,850
You had worn this even the
day before, hadn't you?

973
01:55:02,892 --> 01:55:04,517
It suits you a lot!

974
01:55:25,642 --> 01:55:27,600
Poo... the whole college
runs after Robbie.

975
01:55:32,683 --> 01:55:34,392
He's not my type!

976
01:55:34,892 --> 01:55:37,850
Who is your type?
And when will you meet him?

977
01:55:39,975 --> 01:55:41,850
He might meet me anywhere... anytime.

978
01:55:45,558 --> 01:55:47,850
He could be right here somewhere.

979
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:53,642
Oh God! Who is this... disturbing
Poo so early in the morning!

980
01:56:24,808 --> 01:56:28,850
Who is this who hasn't turned to
give me a second look? Who is he?

981
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:26,600
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty
on a moonlit night in Chandni Chowk...

982
02:02:26,808 --> 02:02:28,600
in a silver spoon,
some Chatni...

983
02:02:31,225 --> 02:02:32,183
some chatni.

984
02:02:49,683 --> 02:02:53,767
Do you know Rohan, Didi always says
that a married woman is the union of...

985
02:02:54,142 --> 02:02:55,892
a wife and a daughter-in-law.

986
02:02:56,892 --> 02:03:01,100
She is a good wife, but she hasn't
managed to be an ideal daughter-in-law

987
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:06,392
And your brother?
Not a day passes...

988
02:03:07,142 --> 02:03:09,392
not a moment passes when he
doesn't remember his parents.

989
02:03:10,558 --> 02:03:14,683
But he never says anything. He has
put up their photograph in the house.

990
02:03:16,142 --> 02:03:18,183
But not once has he
turned towards it.

991
02:03:20,392 --> 02:03:23,392
We have made a small world for
ourselves here, Rohan.

992
02:03:24,392 --> 02:03:27,392
If you look from afar
it's filled with happiness...

993
02:03:29,142 --> 02:03:32,683
but the closer you go,
you will find a lot of sorrow.

994
02:03:36,517 --> 02:03:40,392
Why have you come, Rohan?
Why now?

995
02:03:45,225 --> 02:03:51,850
I had promised bhaiyya that I will
never ask where he went or why he went

996
02:03:55,392 --> 02:03:59,433
But today I have realised that
he doesn't think of us as his own.

997
02:04:02,350 --> 02:04:05,975
That is a pain I can't bear...
can't bear.

998
02:04:07,475 --> 02:04:09,642
I have left some broken
bonds back home, Pooja

999
02:04:11,808 --> 02:04:14,308
that can only attain the status
of a family through my elder brother.

1000
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:23,100
I have come to take my brother back...
take my sister-in-law back...

1001
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:28,308
But I can't do this on my own.

1002
02:04:31,142 --> 02:04:32,975
I will need your support Pooja.

1003
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:39,308
Will you support me?

1004
02:04:46,267 --> 02:04:51,642
No... No... never!
- He is Sonia's brother.

1005
02:04:52,058 --> 02:04:54,475
He's not my brother... And I didn't
even know that Sonia had a brother.

1006
02:04:54,850 --> 02:04:56,725
So Sonia, when was this
brother of yours born?

1007
02:04:56,975 --> 02:04:58,558
Brother? Who's brother?

1008
02:05:01,267 --> 02:05:03,225
My first brother from India
has come.

1009
02:05:03,975 --> 02:05:08,225
I mean first cousin.
He can't stay with me...

1010
02:05:17,683 --> 02:05:21,225
It's only a matter of few days.
At least meet him once.

1011
02:05:24,017 --> 02:05:25,975
My house isn't a charitable institution
that anyone can stay here.

1012
02:05:26,267 --> 02:05:28,225
Daijaan, please explain to her...
- Why are you troubling him? Why?

1013
02:05:28,392 --> 02:05:29,725
Oh stop it Aunty.

1014
02:05:30,808 --> 02:05:32,892
C'mon, In such a big house can't he...
- Can't stay.

1015
02:05:33,267 --> 02:05:36,058
This big house has you wearing
really small clothes... that's why.

1016
02:05:36,392 --> 02:05:39,600
I don't want any young man staring at
you... And I'm the boss of this house.

1017
02:05:39,975 --> 02:05:42,017
And I ring all the bells.
Gosh! What is it?

1018
02:05:43,017 --> 02:05:44,975
What is it? I was just
saving you from an evil eye!

1019
02:05:45,350 --> 02:05:48,892
Who's evil eye?
This whole family is mad.

1020
02:05:49,267 --> 02:05:52,225
All the mad people from Chandni Chowk
have moved in here.

1021
02:05:54,933 --> 02:05:59,392
Didi, Sonia's brother has just
arrived, he has no place to stay.

1022
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:03,850
Can't we give him a
small place in this big house?

1023
02:06:04,892 --> 02:06:06,975
Pooja, You know Rahul, don't you?

1024
02:06:09,933 --> 02:06:12,725
Didi, he has come from India.

1025
02:06:15,225 --> 02:06:20,392
From India...
- My great India... remember?

1026
02:06:22,225 --> 02:06:24,183
Listen to me...
- No... no...

1027
02:06:25,225 --> 02:06:27,975
Just listen to me...
he has come from India.

1028
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:30,517
So? Should I make him sit on my head?
Do you know the population of India?

1029
02:06:30,892 --> 02:06:32,850
If all of them shift here, where
will we sleep? Let me do one thing.

1030
02:06:33,225 --> 02:06:36,975
I'll go to Heathrow and stand there to
invite everyone arriving from India...

1031
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:39,975
saying, 'Please come to my house.
My wife is mad! '

1032
02:06:43,225 --> 02:06:45,350
He is coming today,
he's coming now, right now!

1033
02:06:46,225 --> 02:06:48,308
He is waiting outside and
I'm calling him in...

1034
02:06:53,225 --> 02:06:54,183
Listen...

1035
02:06:57,142 --> 02:06:58,100
Excuse me...

1036
02:07:07,225 --> 02:07:14,100
"We shall never part,
through smiles nor through tears..."

1037
02:07:14,892 --> 02:07:18,850
"we shall never part,
through smiles nor through tears."

1038
02:07:37,142 --> 02:07:42,433
"How helpless are we,
what is this trial by fire..."

1039
02:07:43,142 --> 02:07:48,808
"we stand so close
yet we are so far"

1040
02:07:49,475 --> 02:07:52,892
"If you are the body,
I am the soul."

1041
02:07:55,725 --> 02:07:59,058
"I'm your blood..."

1042
02:08:01,683 --> 02:08:04,100
"we meet and yet we don't..."

1043
02:08:04,558 --> 02:08:07,308
"Oh what an illusion."

1044
02:08:07,850 --> 02:08:13,058
"It's all your blessings,
whether smiles or tears..."

1045
02:08:13,392 --> 02:08:19,767
"we shall never part,
through smiles or through tears."

1046
02:08:38,058 --> 02:08:39,558
My name is Rahul.

1047
02:08:45,808 --> 02:08:47,517
My name is Yash.

1048
02:09:02,017 --> 02:09:06,017
He will stay with us.
Take his luggage...

1049
02:09:48,517 --> 02:09:50,767
And this is your room!

1050
02:09:57,017 --> 02:10:00,683
And listen...
if you ever need anything...

1051
02:10:01,725 --> 02:10:04,892
want anything...
don't bother asking me for it!

1052
02:10:08,642 --> 02:10:11,225
Listen...
- What is it?

1053
02:10:23,933 --> 02:10:26,892
If you want to live in this house
you will have to follow the rules...

1054
02:10:27,267 --> 02:10:30,558
and regulations of the house.
No coming late and try and...

1055
02:10:30,933 --> 02:10:34,725
leave as soon as possible.
Dinner at 8 p.m. Or starve the night

1056
02:10:35,058 --> 02:10:37,892
And... stay away...

1057
02:10:41,933 --> 02:10:45,892
This is too much... Eh!
What are you staring at?

1058
02:10:47,683 --> 02:10:51,350
Say more, Please... it feels nice.
- Eh! Feels nice? Am I singing a song?

1059
02:10:51,725 --> 02:10:54,642
Why do you keep calling me
Eh'? I have a name...

1060
02:10:56,392 --> 02:10:59,892
I know, but I can't say it.
- Why can't you say it?

1061
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:03,350
I said, that I can't say it. Didn't I?
- Oh!

1062
02:11:03,725 --> 02:11:07,225
So you don't want to take my name
as a sign of respect. That's great.

1063
02:11:07,725 --> 02:11:09,683
In that case I should return
the respect too.

1064
02:11:09,933 --> 02:11:12,475
Can I call you Bhaiyya?
- Call your father that!

1065
02:11:12,850 --> 02:11:17,517
Don't you drag my father into this...
actually you can... you have the right

1066
02:11:21,058 --> 02:11:24,558
He got scared! Poo,
I think this one's a little...

1067
02:11:29,933 --> 02:11:32,017
I'm mad? You wear this jacket.

1068
02:11:40,933 --> 02:11:43,767
Rohan, we were waiting for
your call for such a long time.

1069
02:11:50,058 --> 02:11:52,683
Seems like both of you
are right here with me.

1070
02:11:57,017 --> 02:11:57,975
Mad!

1071
02:11:58,433 --> 02:12:00,517
The campus is giving me
an accommodation after a week.

1072
02:12:00,892 --> 02:12:02,975
Right now I'm living with
an Indian family.

1073
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:05,642
Why, an Indian family?

1074
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:09,517
They are very nice people.
When I met them I felt like...

1075
02:12:09,892 --> 02:12:11,850
I have known them for years.
A laughing, happy and...

1076
02:12:12,225 --> 02:12:15,850
contented family,
like we are... we were...

1077
02:12:28,892 --> 02:12:34,350
Is he going to pay for the bill?
Go eat your food... even that's free...

1078
02:12:50,892 --> 02:12:52,850
There goes Madonna
early in the morning.

1079
02:12:59,975 --> 02:13:02,433
If you are here, who is singing
this prayer in the morning?

1080
02:13:03,475 --> 02:13:05,767
Goddess Saraswati herself
has incarnated in the house?

1081
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:13,767
What has happened to
Saraswati here?

1082
02:14:18,475 --> 02:14:20,725
Look what we have done, Pooja?
We have woken them up so early.

1083
02:14:21,142 --> 02:14:22,517
Come on... take their blessings.

1084
02:14:22,725 --> 02:14:27,683
Salutations Didi... Salutations Jeejaji
- Salutations to you too... Who is this?

1085
02:14:29,017 --> 02:14:30,517
You are not able to recognise her
because...

1086
02:14:30,725 --> 02:14:32,725
You are seeing her fully clothed for
the first time. It's your sister-in-law.

1087
02:14:33,017 --> 02:14:34,308
You mean our Poo?

1088
02:14:37,725 --> 02:14:40,225
Have a laddoo!
Mother has sent them.

1089
02:14:41,475 --> 02:14:43,433
I thought I should
keep them as offerings.

1090
02:14:43,725 --> 02:14:45,350
Let me do the tika for you.

1091
02:14:49,725 --> 02:14:51,350
Won't you get your tika done?

1092
02:14:53,058 --> 02:14:55,642
Back home no one leaves
the house without a tika.

1093
02:14:56,683 --> 02:14:58,642
Mother says it's an auspicious
start for the day.

1094
02:15:00,683 --> 02:15:05,642
Mother says?
So then... do it.

1095
02:15:40,683 --> 02:15:42,433
Now who has done this?
- Me of course.

1096
02:15:42,725 --> 02:15:44,642
I enjoy puncturing tyres.

1097
02:15:46,017 --> 02:15:47,975
Was that a joke?
- It was... so?

1098
02:15:54,683 --> 02:15:55,892
No I don't want...

1099
02:15:56,183 --> 02:15:59,350
A guest is equal to a God. And you
can't refuse a lift offered by God.

1100
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:01,392
Come on go now.
- I'll take a taxi.

1101
02:16:01,600 --> 02:16:03,350
Give me the money you would have
paid the cab.

1102
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:07,142
That I am.

1103
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:09,392
Listen... Please come back home
early in the evening.

1104
02:16:09,725 --> 02:16:11,350
Why?
- Just!

1105
02:16:13,058 --> 02:16:14,558
I have finished...
now let's leave.

1106
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:36,558
By the way are you
interested in cricket?

1107
02:16:37,267 --> 02:16:38,225
Why?

1108
02:16:38,433 --> 02:16:40,892
Because there's a match.
India v/s England... at the oval.

1109
02:16:44,058 --> 02:16:46,017
It must be the last over.

1110
02:16:46,517 --> 02:16:48,475
Is it a stolen car?
- No.

1111
02:16:49,058 --> 02:16:50,558
Is it yours?
- Yes.

1112
02:16:50,892 --> 02:16:52,558
Then do what pleases you.

1113
02:17:12,225 --> 02:17:14,517
Don't say anything now. Anything
can happen at the last minute.

1114
02:17:14,892 --> 02:17:16,308
You can never bank on India.

1115
02:17:24,058 --> 02:17:29,225
Did you call me 'bhaiyya'?
- Why? Should I?

1116
02:17:29,683 --> 02:17:32,517
Why? Just drive the car carefully.

1117
02:17:36,892 --> 02:17:39,725
Hey! We won...
- We will win!

1118
02:17:51,725 --> 02:17:53,725
Like every year
Poo will decide on the boy...

1119
02:17:53,892 --> 02:17:56,767
who will escort her to the prom.

1120
02:18:03,308 --> 02:18:06,933
You will be given marks on ten.
To go to the prom with me...

1121
02:18:07,142 --> 02:18:10,100
you have to be brilliant in
three departments.

1122
02:18:59,392 --> 02:19:01,183
You are not so bad.

1123
02:19:01,642 --> 02:19:04,600
I wasn't talking about myself.
I was giving you points.

1124
02:19:14,683 --> 02:19:16,642
I will go only with
him to the prom.

1125
02:19:18,725 --> 02:19:20,350
Where will he go?

1126
02:19:48,725 --> 02:19:49,933
Just fell.

1127
02:20:00,017 --> 02:20:03,642
I'm leaving... I'm leaving.

1128
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:10,767
Listen...
I want to say something to you.

1129
02:20:12,683 --> 02:20:14,642
Say it fast.
I don't have time.

1130
02:20:15,350 --> 02:20:17,308
Should I say it?
- Say it.

1131
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:23,058
Should I?
- Please say.

1132
02:20:23,850 --> 02:20:25,808
You have...
- Yes?

1133
02:20:26,350 --> 02:20:28,808
You have...
- Say it please.

1134
02:20:30,350 --> 02:20:32,308
Both...
- Both of us.

1135
02:20:33,350 --> 02:20:35,100
Both...
- Both...

1136
02:20:35,392 --> 02:20:38,308
Both... Both of your
shoes are not matched.

1137
02:20:45,350 --> 02:20:48,017
That's the latest fashion.
I don't think you know.

1138
02:21:09,683 --> 02:21:11,642
Please tell Didi
not to wait for me.

1139
02:21:33,350 --> 02:21:34,475
Where are you?

1140
02:21:52,392 --> 02:21:59,558
"From the moment
I set my eyes on you..."

1141
02:22:01,850 --> 02:22:05,225
"I marked you to be mine"

1142
02:22:11,308 --> 02:22:18,600
"Don't turn your back on me,
you are mine, only mine"

1143
02:23:03,433 --> 02:23:07,517
"From the moment I set
my eyes on you..."

1144
02:23:08,225 --> 02:23:11,892
"I marked you to be mine"

1145
02:23:12,683 --> 02:23:16,642
"Don't turn your back on me,
you are mine, only mine"

1146
02:23:16,892 --> 02:23:21,308
"Please say it, you are my soniya"

1147
02:23:44,308 --> 02:23:48,183
"From the moment I set
my eyes on you..."

1148
02:23:48,892 --> 02:23:52,600
"I marked you to be mine"

1149
02:23:53,308 --> 02:23:57,725
"Don't turn your back on me,
you are mine, only mine"

1150
02:23:58,058 --> 02:24:02,100
"I accede, you are my soniya"

1151
02:24:50,350 --> 02:24:57,350
"I'm wounded by your love,
that's what makes me act the way I do"

1152
02:24:59,433 --> 02:25:06,017
"That's a nice line to fool me
But it won't work on me"

1153
02:25:08,392 --> 02:25:12,392
"It has taken years for us
to meet each other"

1154
02:25:13,058 --> 02:25:17,017
"Hope these moments last forever"

1155
02:25:17,475 --> 02:25:21,392
"this moment of bliss intoxicates me"

1156
02:25:21,892 --> 02:25:25,933
"Please say it once, you are my soniya"

1157
02:25:30,558 --> 02:25:35,017
"I accede, you are my soniya"

1158
02:26:11,683 --> 02:26:16,975
"Your presence drives me crazy,
I can't think straight"

1159
02:26:21,017 --> 02:26:27,683
"I place you on my eyelashes,
so you are in my dreams forever"

1160
02:26:29,725 --> 02:26:33,975
"I want to hold you tight"

1161
02:26:34,475 --> 02:26:38,433
"I am yours forever, I vow today"

1162
02:26:39,058 --> 02:26:42,975
"Let's both vow at this moment,
that we'll never love each other less"

1163
02:26:45,683 --> 02:26:49,683
"Please say it, you are my soniya"

1164
02:27:26,183 --> 02:27:30,225
"You, you, you are my sonia,
Hey you are, you are my soniya"

1165
02:27:34,933 --> 02:27:37,892
One minute, child...
one minute... What happened?

1166
02:27:44,933 --> 02:27:46,892
Mr. Vajpayee had called for you...
he wants you back in India.

1167
02:27:56,017 --> 02:27:57,975
It's his...
- What's the date today, dad?

1168
02:27:58,225 --> 02:27:59,433
6th September.

1169
02:28:01,225 --> 02:28:04,058
Pooja, Couldn't you wear
decent clothes at least today?

1170
02:28:04,392 --> 02:28:05,850
You came in these strange
black clothes.

1171
02:28:06,058 --> 02:28:07,642
Do you know everyone was
staring at us in the temple?

1172
02:28:07,892 --> 02:28:11,558
If everyone was staring at me instead
of God then it's not my problem.

1173
02:28:17,225 --> 02:28:20,183
Did you hear that, Rahul? She speaks
nonsense even on Bauji's birthday?

1174
02:28:20,392 --> 02:28:22,017
Today is father's birthday.

1175
02:28:25,225 --> 02:28:27,225
Today is bauji's birthday?

1176
02:28:38,392 --> 02:28:40,642
Look at her... From Poo to Parvati...
What happened to you?

1177
02:28:46,892 --> 02:28:48,850
Please take it...
it's the offering from the prayer

1178
02:28:52,892 --> 02:28:54,767
But aren't offerings on
birthday done for the...?

1179
02:28:55,308 --> 02:28:57,767
I know. But Bauji
was a very fun loving man...

1180
02:28:58,142 --> 02:29:01,100
he said even after I go
always remember me on a happy day.

1181
02:29:02,058 --> 02:29:04,767
That's why every year on his birthday
Pooja and I've a special prayer for him

1182
02:29:05,225 --> 02:29:07,767
If he had to see Pooja like this today,
he would've been unconscious.

1183
02:29:10,808 --> 02:29:14,183
You must feel sad that he
is no longer with you now.

1184
02:29:15,142 --> 02:29:16,558
Yes... we do.

1185
02:29:18,267 --> 02:29:20,558
It's important to have the warmth of
elders in a house...

1186
02:29:22,183 --> 02:29:25,767
or else a family always feels
incomplete... Isn't it?

1187
02:29:35,142 --> 02:29:36,767
Don't you miss him?

1188
02:29:41,225 --> 02:29:42,767
Don't you miss?

1189
02:29:45,892 --> 02:29:47,558
Don't you miss Bauji?

1190
02:29:50,892 --> 02:29:53,767
You guys haven't had
your breakfast... Pooja, Krishi...

1191
02:29:54,058 --> 02:29:55,683
Come on... Please come.

1192
02:29:59,392 --> 02:30:00,975
Even you are coming aren't you?

1193
02:30:47,892 --> 02:30:49,350
I forgot.

1194
02:30:52,183 --> 02:30:55,350
The one who is not here
is etched in my memory and the one...

1195
02:30:56,975 --> 02:31:00,392
who is right here,
I forgot about him.

1196
02:31:03,058 --> 02:31:04,850
What present should I give you?

1197
02:31:06,725 --> 02:31:08,725
Just return my Nandini back to me.

1198
02:31:12,725 --> 02:31:17,433
We have lost each other
in this big house.

1199
02:31:21,058 --> 02:31:25,017
Just get back my Nandini for me.

1200
02:31:29,058 --> 02:31:31,058
I want nothing else.

1201
02:31:35,142 --> 02:31:36,267
Nothing else.

1202
02:31:41,975 --> 02:31:42,933
Listen...

1203
02:32:14,142 --> 02:32:16,892
What's the matter?
Your affection is quite overwhelming.

1204
02:32:18,017 --> 02:32:21,433
Yes... That's because you are
looking extremely...

1205
02:32:22,183 --> 02:32:24,350
what do they call it? 'Sexy'.

1206
02:32:29,850 --> 02:32:31,142
Krishi will see.

1207
02:32:32,475 --> 02:32:35,433
By the way, that should have been
my line... Go now.

1208
02:32:36,017 --> 02:32:37,975
My bag and my coat.
- I'll just get it.

1209
02:32:43,683 --> 02:32:45,725
Listen, day after tomorrow
it's Karwa Chauth...

1210
02:32:46,017 --> 02:32:47,433
Wow! So what am I supposed to do?

1211
02:32:47,683 --> 02:32:51,642
You don't do anything. Like every year
there's party for indians

1212
02:32:55,725 --> 02:32:57,308
You are leaving?

1213
02:33:04,058 --> 02:33:05,225
What is it?

1214
02:33:13,267 --> 02:33:14,558
He keeps popping up everywhere.

1215
02:33:26,892 --> 02:33:29,892
So Karwa Chauth!
- Yes... it's day after tomorrow.

1216
02:33:31,308 --> 02:33:34,267
So you must have received the Sargi.
- Sargi?

1217
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:40,683
Sargi... Don't you know what sargi is?
It's a ritual for karwa chauth...

1218
02:33:40,933 --> 02:33:42,892
it's something that every mother-in-law
sends for her daughter-in-law.

1219
02:33:45,392 --> 02:33:47,392
Hasn't your mother-in-law
sent it for you?

1220
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:57,517
Some elder person of your family
must be sending it to you.

1221
02:33:58,558 --> 02:34:00,017
No...

1222
02:34:05,683 --> 02:34:09,517
Don't worry. This year
you will get your sargi.

1223
02:34:15,267 --> 02:34:18,017
My mother... she will
explain everything to you.

1224
02:34:26,558 --> 02:34:28,517
Greetings to you, my child!
- Greetings.

1225
02:34:29,558 --> 02:34:32,308
My son speaks so much about
your family that I feel almost like

1226
02:34:33,558 --> 02:34:35,517
I'm there with all of you.

1227
02:34:36,725 --> 02:34:38,892
He has become a part of
our small family.

1228
02:34:40,433 --> 02:34:42,308
I hope he is not
troubling you too much.

1229
02:34:45,558 --> 02:34:47,517
Dear child, Sargi is something that...

1230
02:34:47,683 --> 02:34:49,850
every mother-in-law sends
for her daughter-in-law.

1231
02:34:52,475 --> 02:34:56,433
Some sweets, a few almonds and...

1232
02:34:58,475 --> 02:35:06,017
signs of marital bliss...
and lots of love.

1233
02:35:15,475 --> 02:35:17,433
I'll send it to you.

1234
02:35:18,767 --> 02:35:20,725
I will think I have sent.
It to my daughter-in-law.

1235
02:35:34,933 --> 02:35:38,767
OK my child I'll hang up now!
- OK.

1236
02:36:11,392 --> 02:36:16,517
At times why do even strangers
seem like they are your own?

1237
02:36:35,142 --> 02:36:38,100
And why is it, at times...

1238
02:36:38,725 --> 02:36:40,725
that even our own people
become strangers?

1239
02:36:47,558 --> 02:36:51,392
Listen... Even I have kept
the karwa chauth fast today.

1240
02:36:55,683 --> 02:36:57,308
For whom?

1241
02:36:59,892 --> 02:37:02,308
What's going on there?
- Something that doesn't happen here.

1242
02:37:04,350 --> 02:37:06,725
Karwa chauth fast?
That too for me?

1243
02:37:07,725 --> 02:37:10,975
Why? Who am I of yours?

1244
02:37:17,058 --> 02:37:19,017
You don't have the guts
to tell your brother and bhabhi...

1245
02:37:19,225 --> 02:37:22,308
how you are related to them...
Trying to be a great tiger before me!

1246
02:37:23,475 --> 02:37:24,892
Let go of my hand.

1247
02:37:25,225 --> 02:37:27,100
Why has he held her hand?
- Let go of my hand.

1248
02:37:27,350 --> 02:37:28,642
I let go.

1249
02:37:29,808 --> 02:37:33,767
What if I tell them?
Today in the presence of everyone...

1250
02:37:35,225 --> 02:37:40,308
what if I tell them the truth,
what will you do?

1251
02:37:40,725 --> 02:37:43,558
I don't think you will be able to.
You are scared.

1252
02:37:45,683 --> 02:37:47,433
What if I do?

1253
02:37:48,017 --> 02:37:50,475
Then I will tell
everyone what's in my heart.

1254
02:37:51,475 --> 02:37:55,517
Really? Is that so?
- It's a bet.

1255
02:37:56,267 --> 02:37:58,517
Don't bet with me,
you might regret.

1256
02:38:00,267 --> 02:38:03,475
Maybe that's what I want.

1257
02:38:06,225 --> 02:38:08,058
But looking at you...

1258
02:38:10,267 --> 02:38:12,225
I wonder if all this is a dream.

1259
02:38:12,683 --> 02:38:13,642
Dream?

1260
02:38:15,558 --> 02:38:18,017
Yes... How can anyone
be so frightened?

1261
02:39:46,225 --> 02:39:47,308
Your turn.

1262
02:39:53,475 --> 02:39:58,433
"My trinkets tinkle...
they say I am yours"

1263
02:40:10,142 --> 02:40:15,892
"I can't spend a minute without you,
Oh I am yours"

1264
02:40:21,183 --> 02:40:24,475
"Take me away...
oh darling take me away"

1265
02:40:48,225 --> 02:40:55,433
"My trinkets tinkle...
they say I am yours,"

1266
02:40:57,142 --> 02:41:02,433
"I can't spend a minute without you,
Oh I am yours"

1267
02:41:03,142 --> 02:41:06,642
"Take me away,
oh darling take me away."

1268
02:41:13,100 --> 02:41:19,517
"Your trinkets tinkle...
they say I am yours..."

1269
02:41:22,767 --> 02:41:27,100
"can't spend a moment without you,
Oh I am yours"

1270
02:41:27,683 --> 02:41:31,350
"Take me away, oh darling,
take me away"

1271
02:42:10,058 --> 02:42:13,808
"I can't think of a life
without you,"

1272
02:42:15,058 --> 02:42:19,017
"I spend sleepless nights
counting stars in the sky,"

1273
02:42:19,725 --> 02:42:24,058
"my heart keeps calling out to you,
my bindiya makes a sign,"

1274
02:42:27,017 --> 02:42:34,017
"The shimmering bindiya,
shines like a star next to the moon,"

1275
02:42:39,433 --> 02:42:43,392
"My anklets call out to you,
try to make up to you as you sulk,"

1276
02:42:43,933 --> 02:42:48,850
"Oh my loved, my beloved.
Try and understand..."

1277
02:42:49,058 --> 02:42:51,392
"what I'm trying to say"

1278
02:42:52,183 --> 02:42:58,975
"Your trinkets tinkle,
they say I am yours"

1279
02:43:02,225 --> 02:43:06,350
"Can't spend a moment without you,
Oh I am yours."

1280
02:43:07,017 --> 02:43:10,308
"Take me away, oh darling,
take me away."

1281
02:43:41,517 --> 02:43:43,975
"May we be in
marital bliss forever..."

1282
02:43:46,433 --> 02:43:48,975
"may our soul mates be
with us forever"

1283
02:43:51,392 --> 02:43:55,892
"Now that you have entered my world,
never leave"

1284
02:43:56,350 --> 02:44:00,892
"Take my hand and ask me
to be yours forever"

1285
02:44:06,392 --> 02:44:12,892
"Oh darling you look so beautiful,
seems like you have been made for me"

1286
02:44:15,933 --> 02:44:20,392
"Your beauty shines so brightly,
that it shames the moon"

1287
02:44:23,725 --> 02:44:28,267
"Go away you liar, I'm not taken in"

1288
02:44:28,642 --> 02:44:32,892
"Don't flatter too much,
your giving yourself away"

1289
02:44:43,225 --> 02:44:47,642
"I wish from the bottom of my heart,
may your pair be forever"

1290
02:44:47,933 --> 02:44:55,183
"Oh my love, my beloved, wish
we spent our lives together forever"

1291
02:45:00,892 --> 02:45:08,225
"Your trinkets tinkle,
they say I am yours"

1292
02:45:10,892 --> 02:45:15,392
"Can't spend a moment without you,
Oh I am yours"

1293
02:45:15,892 --> 02:45:19,183
"Take me away, oh darling,
take me away"

1294
02:47:15,525 --> 02:47:16,983
You are mad!

1295
02:47:17,858 --> 02:47:19,317
My son has turned into
a complete Englishman.

1296
02:47:19,525 --> 02:47:21,150
No. Not at all.

1297
02:47:21,525 --> 02:47:24,525
Really, Aunty... Sometimes
I wish we were living in India.

1298
02:47:25,858 --> 02:47:29,192
And Krishi would sing the
same songs that I grew up singing.

1299
02:47:30,858 --> 02:47:35,233
But we are here and I have become
'mummy' from a mother.

1300
02:47:36,150 --> 02:47:38,233
Why do you think so, Anjali?
Whatever the tongue...

1301
02:47:38,525 --> 02:47:40,025
the culture is yours, isn't it?

1302
02:47:40,233 --> 02:47:45,317
Still... It's not the same, Aunty...
...Just see... Coming!

1303
02:47:49,942 --> 02:47:50,900
Mad!

1304
02:47:51,983 --> 02:47:55,775
By the way, D... j... Daijaan,
What are these children doing?

1305
02:47:57,483 --> 02:48:01,150
There's a function in Baba's school.
They are rehearsing for that.

1306
02:48:01,983 --> 02:48:04,692
All of us are going for it.
You will come with us, won't you?

1307
02:48:10,608 --> 02:48:12,233
I'll just be back.

1308
02:48:22,858 --> 02:48:24,442
What do I do with this?

1309
02:48:36,275 --> 02:48:38,233
What are you doing?
I'll manage myself.

1310
02:48:38,525 --> 02:48:40,442
Leave it Daijaan,
I'll manage myself.

1311
02:48:41,483 --> 02:48:45,233
I'll do it myself... Daijaan...
Daijaan... DJ!

1312
02:48:52,817 --> 02:48:56,817
My little child! My child!

1313
02:48:59,817 --> 02:49:04,358
I knew it...
My heart kept telling me

1314
02:49:05,733 --> 02:49:11,775
that it was my Baba. Oh Allah!
How big you've grown up to be.

1315
02:49:16,650 --> 02:49:20,108
You hid it from your DJ too?
You didn't even tell me?

1316
02:49:20,775 --> 02:49:23,650
Why? My child, why?

1317
02:49:24,400 --> 02:49:31,358
Didn't I keep telling you, Anjali?
See, it's my little child!

1318
02:49:33,108 --> 02:49:37,692
It's my child.
You have come back to me.

1319
02:49:47,400 --> 02:49:48,692
My child!

1320
02:50:04,525 --> 02:50:05,817
Just coming!

1321
02:50:18,358 --> 02:50:19,650
Just coming!

1322
02:50:43,025 --> 02:50:44,483
Oh! Where is Didi?
Where's she gone?

1323
02:50:54,358 --> 02:50:56,108
Oh my God! Is this our table?

1324
02:50:56,358 --> 02:50:58,150
They do this all the time.
Look at this, Aunty,

1325
02:50:58,358 --> 02:51:00,817
They give the front seats to the
shining white army and seat us behind.

1326
02:51:01,025 --> 02:51:03,150
Why do they do it
always? No... Aunty,

1327
02:51:03,483 --> 02:51:05,317
Where is that silly principle?

1328
02:51:11,358 --> 02:51:13,025
She has arrived, the cunning vixen.

1329
02:51:17,692 --> 02:51:20,317
Is she the Queen of England that
she's got the table in the front?

1330
02:51:26,358 --> 02:51:29,317
Please go you silly woman...
Hope your table starts shaking...

1331
02:51:29,525 --> 02:51:31,108
hope your chair breaks to pieces.

1332
02:51:35,358 --> 02:51:37,108
Should we sit?

1333
02:51:44,358 --> 02:51:46,067
Already there have been a
lot of complaints.

1334
02:51:46,358 --> 02:51:48,567
Even last year at this function
you had created a ruckus!

1335
02:51:49,025 --> 02:51:51,525
Krishi is performing... Very nice...
what's the big deal?

1336
02:51:53,192 --> 02:51:55,442
You just shut up and stop
this Englishwoman act of yours!

1337
02:51:55,650 --> 02:51:57,233
Anjali, she's right!
- You keep quiet.

1338
02:51:57,483 --> 02:52:00,233
My son's on stage...
I will at least whistle once.

1339
02:52:00,608 --> 02:52:02,567
No... No...
- Just one whistle...

1340
02:52:24,067 --> 02:52:28,567
How sweet my son looks!
He looks just like you, sweetoo!

1341
02:52:33,692 --> 02:52:35,233
God, Please protect my son.

1342
02:52:35,650 --> 02:52:37,983
Eh! Your son is just performing...
not fighting a war on the border.

1343
02:52:38,275 --> 02:52:40,233
Just see!
- Just see!

1344
02:52:45,983 --> 02:52:48,233
My son! My son!
- Even mine.

1345
02:52:51,275 --> 02:52:52,567
Now sing your, 'Do Re Mi'.

1346
02:55:20,400 --> 02:55:22,025
Did you do this?

1347
02:55:45,400 --> 02:55:48,650
Now tell me something...
You must have been a little nervous?

1348
02:55:48,983 --> 02:55:51,775
I was a little nervous.
But someone said something to me...

1349
02:55:52,108 --> 02:55:53,775
and everything was alright.

1350
02:55:54,900 --> 02:55:56,983
What did the person say?
- Just a minute.

1351
02:55:59,025 --> 02:56:02,775
If you want to be someone in life...
if you want to achieve something...

1352
02:56:03,275 --> 02:56:05,692
If you want to win, always
listen to your hear.

1353
02:56:06,233 --> 02:56:07,983
And if even that doesn't
give you any answers...

1354
02:56:08,192 --> 02:56:11,483
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

1355
02:56:12,400 --> 02:56:15,317
And then you will
cross all the hurdles...

1356
02:56:16,025 --> 02:56:18,983
all your problems will vanish,
victory will be yours...

1357
02:56:20,025 --> 02:56:21,317
only yours.

1358
02:56:25,400 --> 02:56:29,358
Who said this? Papa?
- No. He.

1359
02:56:59,942 --> 02:57:01,900
Did you take care of mother?

1360
02:57:08,942 --> 02:57:10,900
Did you get selected
in the cricket team?

1361
02:57:20,942 --> 02:57:23,608
How did you manage
to lose so much weight?

1362
02:57:32,233 --> 02:57:36,900
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?

1363
02:57:37,317 --> 02:57:41,567
Come back home, Bhaiyya.
Please come back home.

1364
02:57:42,942 --> 02:57:44,900
Come back home, Bhaiyya.

1365
02:57:46,858 --> 02:57:48,692
Has Papa sent you?

1366
02:57:57,858 --> 02:58:00,442
Rohan, now this is my family.

1367
02:58:02,192 --> 02:58:05,317
These are my people.
This is my world!

1368
02:58:10,608 --> 02:58:15,150
And the home you are talking about
was never mine in the first place...

1369
02:58:18,858 --> 02:58:20,858
and will never be.

1370
02:58:24,858 --> 02:58:27,483
You go back now... just go back.
You...

1371
02:58:29,858 --> 02:58:33,817
I have seen you again,
that's enough for me.

1372
02:58:35,192 --> 02:58:36,817
Go back.

1373
02:58:44,317 --> 02:58:49,650
Do you know Bhaiyya,
you often said when I was a child

1374
02:58:52,192 --> 02:58:54,192
That mother loved you more than me.

1375
02:58:58,192 --> 02:58:59,775
I never liked it then.

1376
02:59:02,192 --> 02:59:03,775
I used to get angry.

1377
02:59:07,233 --> 02:59:09,567
But today, I would like to tell you,
that you were right.

1378
02:59:12,817 --> 02:59:14,775
Mother loves you more than me.

1379
02:59:17,817 --> 02:59:22,775
She loves you too much.
And she will always.

1380
02:59:25,817 --> 02:59:28,775
She will always
- I know.

1381
02:59:34,900 --> 02:59:36,775
He hasn't forgotten Dad's words.

1382
02:59:42,817 --> 02:59:44,567
He will never come back.

1383
02:59:49,817 --> 02:59:53,692
He will come Rohan.
He will definitely come back.

1384
02:59:55,108 --> 02:59:57,067
I know my brother-in-law well.

1385
02:59:58,733 --> 03:00:01,025
Just get him to meet
mother and father.

1386
03:00:06,733 --> 03:00:08,692
Will you be able to do that?

1387
03:00:20,275 --> 03:00:23,108
You know, dad...
I had a strange dream last night.

1388
03:00:24,150 --> 03:00:26,692
I dreamt that you and Mom had come
to London to surprise me.

1389
03:00:28,150 --> 03:00:29,483
Then?
- What then, dad?

1390
03:00:29,733 --> 03:00:32,025
The alarm went off... I mean...

1391
03:00:32,733 --> 03:00:34,692
why would you and Mom come to
London to surprise me?

1392
03:00:40,900 --> 03:00:42,192
I'll speak to you later

1393
03:00:52,067 --> 03:00:53,692
The work's done.

1394
03:01:08,733 --> 03:01:10,567
Guess where we are.
- Where, dad?

1395
03:01:14,483 --> 03:01:17,483
Is it ever possible that my son dreams
of something and I don't turn it true.

1396
03:01:19,025 --> 03:01:21,108
Tell me where you are right now,
we want to meet you just now...

1397
03:01:22,733 --> 03:01:24,483
You are meeting me
after such a long time.

1398
03:01:25,983 --> 03:01:29,317
Present? Now...
at this time... here...

1399
03:01:29,650 --> 03:01:31,608
You meet me at 5 p.m. At
the Blue water Shopping mall.

1400
03:01:32,150 --> 03:01:34,108
But tell me what
you want, my child.

1401
03:01:34,483 --> 03:01:37,442
You will find what
I want right there, Dad.

1402
03:01:55,358 --> 03:01:56,775
What's happening here?
- I'm looking for the receipts.

1403
03:01:57,025 --> 03:01:58,983
What receipts?
- To return the clothes.

1404
03:01:59,358 --> 03:02:01,317
If you have to return them, why do you
buy them in the first place?

1405
03:02:01,733 --> 03:02:04,442
The country best in the world
is our India... Right Mom?

1406
03:02:04,692 --> 03:02:05,650
Mother's stooge!

1407
03:02:11,025 --> 03:02:13,150
Did you tape that? That Indian serial,
Kyon Ki Saas Bhi kabhi bahu thi.

1408
03:02:13,567 --> 03:02:15,442
What a brilliant twist!
The son dies.

1409
03:02:15,692 --> 03:02:18,650
Oh God! Really? Oh No...
You have given away the suspense.

1410
03:02:21,692 --> 03:02:23,650
What are you doing?
- It's fine till the hugs

1411
03:02:23,900 --> 03:02:26,358
- but he keeps kissing me too.
- You have never kissed me so much.

1412
03:02:26,692 --> 03:02:28,650
Come home, darling... and see.

1413
03:07:00,650 --> 03:07:04,317
Lies! You lied to me.

1414
03:07:05,817 --> 03:07:08,275
Yes... I lied to you, Dad.

1415
03:07:09,692 --> 03:07:11,650
What would I have achieved even if
I had told truth.

1416
03:07:12,692 --> 03:07:14,317
I wouldn't be able to break
your ego.

1417
03:07:15,858 --> 03:07:17,858
What else is it if not ego, Dad?

1418
03:07:18,358 --> 03:07:21,400
That separates a mother from her child
that takes away...

1419
03:07:21,692 --> 03:07:24,900
a brother from his sibling... that
throws a father away from his son...?

1420
03:07:25,192 --> 03:07:28,608
He is not my son!
I don't believe that he is my son.

1421
03:07:29,567 --> 03:07:31,525
Has he fulfilled the duties
of a son? He didn't.

1422
03:07:32,692 --> 03:07:35,775
He did, Dad... he did.

1423
03:07:39,150 --> 03:07:40,900
He always fulfilled them.

1424
03:07:43,025 --> 03:07:47,317
He only made one mistake... Love.

1425
03:07:49,358 --> 03:07:51,900
If that is a crime according to
your law, so be it.

1426
03:07:53,692 --> 03:07:56,483
But isn't it your duty as an elder
to forgive him for his mistake?

1427
03:08:00,067 --> 03:08:02,025
But you came down to punishing him.

1428
03:08:06,275 --> 03:08:08,233
What kind of punishment is this, Dad?

1429
03:08:12,275 --> 03:08:14,025
What punishment is this?

1430
03:08:21,442 --> 03:08:23,025
Just look into my eyes and say that...

1431
03:08:23,275 --> 03:08:25,233
you don't feel the pain
of parting with him.

1432
03:08:27,192 --> 03:08:29,025
Say that you don't remember him.

1433
03:08:30,525 --> 03:08:32,233
Say that you don't love him.

1434
03:08:34,608 --> 03:08:37,317
Say it, Dad. Say it.

1435
03:08:37,983 --> 03:08:42,567
I don't love him.
I don't love him.

1436
03:08:43,817 --> 03:08:45,483
I said it, didn't I?

1437
03:08:59,483 --> 03:09:04,150
God has blessed you
with everything, Dad... Everything.

1438
03:09:07,817 --> 03:09:09,567
I just wish he had given you a heart!
- Shut up!

1439
03:09:11,108 --> 03:09:12,442
You irreverent child!

1440
03:09:20,192 --> 03:09:21,983
You love him.

1441
03:09:25,650 --> 03:09:29,150
You love him a lot.
You love him a lot.

1442
03:09:32,192 --> 03:09:38,150
I have got my answer.
You really love him.

1443
03:09:41,775 --> 03:09:43,442
Let's go back, Rahul.

1444
03:09:44,192 --> 03:09:48,483
It's too much now...
This is not our country.

1445
03:09:49,150 --> 03:09:53,608
These are not our people.
We have set up a house here...

1446
03:09:54,150 --> 03:09:57,108
but have you ever wondered
what kind of a home is this...

1447
03:09:59,150 --> 03:10:02,108
that doesn't have a mother's
warmth or a father's blessings?

1448
03:10:05,400 --> 03:10:09,108
Let's go back, Rahul.
Mother and Father are here...

1449
03:10:10,150 --> 03:10:15,567
They are right here.
They are elders.

1450
03:10:18,150 --> 03:10:22,692
They are a little angry with us.
But we will ask for forgiveness.

1451
03:10:25,150 --> 03:10:29,108
Rahul... I know
they are as incomplete without us...

1452
03:10:30,150 --> 03:10:32,108
as we are without them.

1453
03:10:33,150 --> 03:10:36,108
We will ask for forgiveness, Rahul.
Let's go back.

1454
03:10:41,525 --> 03:10:43,358
You will never understand.

1455
03:10:47,858 --> 03:10:51,817
To turn a stranger into your own...

1456
03:10:52,483 --> 03:10:54,442
and then to turn him back
to a stranger...

1457
03:10:57,150 --> 03:10:59,108
you can never understand the pain.

1458
03:11:01,317 --> 03:11:04,275
I agree they are elders...

1459
03:11:07,150 --> 03:11:09,442
but even they don't have the right
to break a heart.

1460
03:11:13,150 --> 03:11:15,442
Even they don't have
a right to break a heart.

1461
03:11:38,275 --> 03:11:40,233
I think we should call him back.

1462
03:12:23,192 --> 03:12:27,817
Yash, It was her last wish
to have Rahul...

1463
03:12:29,067 --> 03:12:32,275
Just wait for a while... I
know he will definitely come.

1464
03:12:34,233 --> 03:12:37,025
We don't need to wait
for anyone... Rohan.

1465
03:13:40,358 --> 03:13:42,358
Rahul and Anjali are leaving.

1466
03:13:46,025 --> 03:13:47,983
They are leaving tomorrow from here.

1467
03:13:50,317 --> 03:13:52,275
They haven't even come home.

1468
03:13:58,025 --> 03:13:59,317
If you say to them...

1469
03:14:18,192 --> 03:14:23,233
Do you know mother always
says that...

1470
03:14:24,942 --> 03:14:26,692
a husband is God.

1471
03:14:28,358 --> 03:14:32,275
No matter what he says...
no matter what he thinks...

1472
03:14:33,233 --> 03:14:34,900
he is always right.

1473
03:14:36,608 --> 03:14:40,650
You brought Rahul home one day...
right.

1474
03:14:42,942 --> 03:14:50,858
We gave him lots of love... right.
He became a part of our family.

1475
03:14:54,150 --> 03:14:59,817
He became my life...
right... absolutely right!

1476
03:15:03,733 --> 03:15:08,650
Then... one day he left home
and went away.

1477
03:15:11,275 --> 03:15:12,233
Wrong

1478
03:15:14,858 --> 03:15:18,817
You let him leave... wrong

1479
03:15:21,858 --> 03:15:26,817
You separated a mother from
her child... wrong.

1480
03:15:30,192 --> 03:15:36,150
Our family shattered
to pieces... wrong.

1481
03:15:40,608 --> 03:15:42,817
Then how does a husband become God?

1482
03:15:47,942 --> 03:15:50,108
God can't do any wrong can he?

1483
03:15:56,150 --> 03:16:03,567
My husband is just a husband...
just a husband... Not God.

1484
03:16:08,608 --> 03:16:10,025
Not God.

1485
03:16:12,983 --> 03:16:14,275
Nandini!

1486
03:16:15,817 --> 03:16:21,358
I said it... Didn't I?
That's it!

1487
03:17:01,983 --> 03:17:03,942
Ever since the day you left,
Bhaiyya...

1488
03:17:04,900 --> 03:17:06,692
mother has only seen you
through His eyes.

1489
03:17:09,525 --> 03:17:10,692
He is the one who gave a mother...

1490
03:17:10,858 --> 03:17:13,150
the strength to stay away
from her son.

1491
03:17:15,733 --> 03:17:17,692
Please swear on Him, Bhaiyya...

1492
03:17:19,733 --> 03:17:21,692
that you will come home
at least once.

1493
03:17:23,692 --> 03:17:25,025
Just once, Bhaiyya.

1494
03:17:26,733 --> 03:17:31,233
Even if it is for a moment.
Even if it is for a day.

1495
03:17:33,900 --> 03:17:35,692
Let Bhabhi feel
at least once that

1496
03:17:35,900 --> 03:17:37,858
she is the daughter-in-law
of this family.

1497
03:17:39,733 --> 03:17:41,692
She is a part of the family.

1498
03:17:42,733 --> 03:17:44,817
At least let your shadow fall
on the photograph...

1499
03:17:45,067 --> 03:17:47,692
that has kept your memory alive in
mother's eyes for the last ten years.

1500
03:17:53,692 --> 03:17:58,608
Just once, Bhaiyya.
Then you can leave

1501
03:18:00,483 --> 03:18:04,650
No one will stop you.
No one will stop you.

1502
03:18:09,775 --> 03:18:11,733
On the strength of that one memory...

1503
03:18:12,067 --> 03:18:16,817
that one moment... Mother
can lead her entire life.

1504
03:18:20,858 --> 03:18:23,025
Can't you do just this
much for mother?

1505
03:22:42,817 --> 03:22:45,108
You took my words so much to heart
that you went away.

1506
03:22:47,192 --> 03:22:51,983
Didn't even look back once.
Didn't come back even once.

1507
03:22:53,858 --> 03:22:55,358
Didn't come back.

1508
03:22:57,192 --> 03:22:59,192
Where did you call
me back, Papa?

1509
03:23:02,817 --> 03:23:04,650
Did I have to call you back?

1510
03:23:05,817 --> 03:23:07,525
Am I not elder?
Do I have to call you back?

1511
03:23:07,775 --> 03:23:09,150
Am I not elder?

1512
03:23:11,483 --> 03:23:13,358
I thought you didn't love me.

1513
03:23:14,400 --> 03:23:16,275
I thought you didn't
think of me as your son.

1514
03:23:16,567 --> 03:23:20,108
How could you think that?
How could you?

1515
03:23:21,858 --> 03:23:26,358
I brought you into this house for
the first time with these hands.

1516
03:23:28,400 --> 03:23:31,358
You completed our family.
You fulfilled all our dreams.

1517
03:23:33,150 --> 03:23:34,317
How did you think...?

1518
03:23:34,525 --> 03:23:38,358
I thought you didn't love me...
didn't love me.

1519
03:23:40,400 --> 03:23:44,692
I love you very much,
my son... love you very much.

1520
03:23:47,483 --> 03:23:53,317
Just... just couldn't say it.

1521
03:23:55,525 --> 03:24:00,317
In these ten years I have thought
about you every moment every day.

1522
03:24:01,608 --> 03:24:05,567
I thought of you so much that,
I felt like embracing you and...

1523
03:24:05,817 --> 03:24:07,775
telling you how much I love you.

1524
03:24:13,358 --> 03:24:15,108
Just couldn't say it.

1525
03:24:19,358 --> 03:24:23,275
Elders' anger is a part of...
their love, my son.

1526
03:24:25,233 --> 03:24:29,025
You took it so much to heart that
you got angry and left home...?

1527
03:24:31,025 --> 03:24:32,983
And I didn't even call you back.

1528
03:24:34,692 --> 03:24:38,025
Why would you call me?
I should have come on my own.

1529
03:24:38,358 --> 03:24:40,692
Yes...
- I should have come on my own.

1530
03:24:42,608 --> 03:24:46,025
Why didn't you come?
Why didn't you?

1531
03:24:46,608 --> 03:24:49,650
This is your home...
You are the elder son of the family...

1532
03:24:50,025 --> 03:24:51,983
You are my son... my son.

1533
03:24:55,442 --> 03:25:02,567
And now I have grown old my son.

1534
03:25:04,525 --> 03:25:06,233
I have grown old.

1535
03:25:09,358 --> 03:25:10,983
At least forgive me now.

1536
03:25:13,608 --> 03:25:18,733
At least forgive me
now... At least now.

1537
03:25:57,192 --> 03:25:59,192
Come here, son.

1538
03:26:08,525 --> 03:26:09,775
Son...

1539
03:26:11,525 --> 03:26:16,150
At times the youngsters
in the house show the right...

1540
03:26:16,525 --> 03:26:18,525
path to the elders in the family.

1541
03:26:21,192 --> 03:26:25,150
I kept you away from your brother
for years.

1542
03:26:30,525 --> 03:26:34,483
Please forgive me if you can.

1543
03:26:35,942 --> 03:26:38,150
Forgive me... forgive me.
