1
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,378
<i>You are an obsession.
I cannot sleep.</i>

2
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,246
<i>I am your possession.
Unopened at your feet.</i>

3
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,083
<i>There's no balance,
no equality.</i>

4
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,886
<i>Be still, I will not
accept defeat.</i>

5
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:37,053
<i>I will have you,
Yes I will have you.</i>

6
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:41,259
<i>I will find a way
and I will have you.</i>

7
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:45,360
<i>Like a butterfly,
a wild butterfly.</i>

8
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,940
<i>I will collect you
and capture you.</i>

9
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,941
I don't think
this is goth night.

10
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,011
This place sucks!

11
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,272
Indeed!

12
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,145
<i>Who do you want me to be
to make you sleep with me?</i>

13
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,817
I'm going
to the bathroom.

14
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:03,184
There's an idea for a
poem I want to write!

15
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,622
<i>Who do you want me to be
to make you sleep with me?</i>

16
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,660
Hey!
Watch it, fat ass!

17
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,292
<i>#I need you, I need you,
by sun or candlelight</i>

18
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:19,565
<i>You protest.
You want to leave</i>

19
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:23,335
<i>Stay.
There's no alternative</i>

20
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,844
<i>Your face appears again.
I see your beauty there</i>

21
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:31,349
<i>But I see danger,
stranger beware.</i>

22
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:35,319
<i>A circumstance
in your naked dreams.</i>

23
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,619
<i>Your affection is
not what it seems.</i>

24
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:43,719
<i>You are an obsession.
You're my obsession.</i>

25
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,960
<i>What do you want me to be
to make you sleep with me?</i>

26
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,060
<i>You are an obsession.
You're my obsession.</i>

27
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,506
<i>What do you want me to be
to make you sleep with me?</i>

28
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,403
I want to leave,
I don't belong here.

29
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,037
It's fun cause we're together.

30
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,082
No it's not!

31
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:43,046
What's with that solid gold
dancer with his ass in the air?

32
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,417
The dazzle dancer?

33
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,287
Yeah, why don't you
guys get married!

34
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,622
<i>I don't even
know if he's gay.</i>

35
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,593
<i>He's got like frosted hair.</i>

36
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,133
George Michael has frosted hair
and he's like totally straight.

37
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,136
Adam, you're 21,
you're like almost 30.

38
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,671
You need to more aggressive.

39
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,433
What do I say?

40
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,202
Just be yourself.

41
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,106
What's that?

42
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,202
Tell him you liked his dancing.

43
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,876
<i>Oh my God, yeah, that F.I.T.
Fag in training was there...</i>

44
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,215
<i>and of course Keith was there.</i>

45
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,312
<i>Let Carrie tell the story, she
tells it so much better than you.</i>

46
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:22,351
I'm standing there talking
to Keith Herring and this guy...

47
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,896
starts comparing him to Warhol.

48
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,660
It was so embarrassing.

49
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,235
He hates those
comparisons, you know.

50
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,308
<i>God, it's so tragic.</i>

51
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,470
Well I guess Bela Lugosi
ain't dead after all.

52
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:47,578
He is dead, people
like you killed him.

53
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,177
Oh, chill out.

54
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,523
- Oh.
- How did it go?

55
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,322
Oh God, I'm such a loser.

56
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,989
You are not, would I be
friends with a loser?

57
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:01,999
Hey!

58
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,495
Sorry about my
friend Carrie.

59
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,098
I'm Maura Bid and
this is Rex Havoc.

60
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,172
Cool look, Rex.

61
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,941
Yeah, my last
boyfriend was a goth,

62
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,212
are all of you as wild
and nasty as he was?

63
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,219
The night decrees its own
appreciations for some mortals...

64
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,384
treading the river Styx.

65
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,220
So you don't like to dance?

66
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,560
Not to this music.

67
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,259
Yeah, well it is Danceateria.

68
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,201
Yeah, more like Danceaqueeria.

69
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,607
What is that,
is that like a rib?

70
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,741
Yeah, you want one?

71
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,218
Na, na, I don't have much of an
appetite if you catch my drift.

72
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,347
Hey, you all want a bump?

73
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,652
The bump?

74
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,660
We're goths, we don't
dance, we're dead.

75
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:07,199
No, no, a bump of coke.

76
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,527
Drugs?

77
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,683
<i>Look at me, look at me.</i>

78
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,223
Whew!
Whoa!

79
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,504
I am so sorry.

80
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,736
It's alright, at least it's
not the same one as last time.

81
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,834
Hey, Rex.

82
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,037
Oh my God,

83
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,412
he totally looks like the
guy from the Ah-Ha video!

84
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,008
Well, he can
'Take On Me' anytime.

85
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,753
Do you think he
still has some cocaine?

86
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,688
Oh my God, you're like totally
addicted after like one bump!

87
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,350
No, I'm not.

88
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,889
It was fun, it wasn't like
I thought it would be.

89
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,522
Well it gave me the
total Hershey squirts.

90
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,567
I hear they cut it
with baby laxatives.

91
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,568
Well, you said you wanted
to lose some weight.

92
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,871
Hi.

93
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,203
Hey, you okay?

94
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,709
Yeah, just my wrist.

95
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,036
Where do you live?

96
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,080
Brooklyn.

97
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,878
Me too, me too.

98
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,212
Sun's coming up,
you want to watch it...

99
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,946
from the
Brooklyn Bridge?

100
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,716
Well I can't just
leave my friend Rhonda.

101
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,519
Good night.

102
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,860
- Good luck.
- Stop it!

103
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,055
So?

104
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,132
Okay.

105
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,860
All right.

106
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,896
Yeah, I go to A.M.D.A., you
know that theatre school uptown.

107
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,232
We're doing
The Sound of Music,

108
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,897
I'm up for the
part of the Captain.

109
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,237
<i>Perhaps I had a
wicked childhood.</i>

110
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,037
Wow.

111
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,908
<i>Perhaps I had a
miserable youth...</i>

112
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,071
Someday I'm going
to dance on Broadway.

113
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,170
Watch this...

114
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,874
Ew!

115
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,418
Well, don't give up you've
obviously got a huge talent.

116
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,509
Whew!

117
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,713
Oh my God, just kidding.

118
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,535
Give it here.

119
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,203
Hey, you know
somehow I feel like...

120
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,543
I've known you my whole life.

121
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,207
Really, it's not just the drugs?

122
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,480
Oh no, this is way
bigger than drugs.

123
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,781
Oh my God, I know.

124
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,353
<i>When I saw you
dancing up there,</i>

125
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,227
I knew you were the one.

126
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,061
I knew I was the one too.

127
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,568
Where have you
been my whole life?

128
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,605
I've been looking for you.

129
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,900
Here I am.

130
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,635
This is so fun.

131
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,535
I love you.

132
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,637
I love you too.

133
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,948
What's your name again?

134
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,517
Watch this.

135
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,521
Wow!

136
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,863
<i>Oh good, more cocaine.</i>

137
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,868
You have such an awesome body,
do you like exercise and stuff?

138
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:38,875
Yeah, I think I'm
the only gay guy...

139
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,378
in the whole world
that works out.

140
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,443
Hey, what's that
muscle called on your arm?

141
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,352
Huh?

142
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,424
Here?

143
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,117
Tricep.

144
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,285
What about those, those ones.

145
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,386
Pecs.

146
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,557
Yeah, like that?

147
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,827
Lats...

148
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:14,980
Abs, quads, gluts...

149
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,449
Oh my God I'm like the
luckiest guy in the

150
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,848
whole world right now.

151
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,510
You are so f'ing hot.

152
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,986
Bicep.

153
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,636
Whoa...

154
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,759
Puppy don't look.

155
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,716
<i>You are an obsession.
I cannot sleep.</i>

156
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,052
<i>I am your possession.
Unopened at your feet.</i>

157
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:09,560
<i>There's no balance,
no equality.</i>

158
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,621
<i>#Be still, I will not
accept defeat.</i>

159
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,325
Sorry, sorry.

160
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,561
<i>Yes I will have you.</i>

161
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,764
<i>I will find a way
and I will have...</i>

162
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,111
Hey.

163
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,518
I thought you left.

164
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,251
Oh, no I just came up
for some fresh air.

165
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,984
But if you can't beat
them join them right?

166
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,722
Can I have a hit of that?

167
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,821
Isn't this retro music awesome?

168
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,662
It reminds me of slumber
parties in grade school.

169
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:56,904
Wow!

170
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,476
Somebody needs a drink!

171
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,478
No, no, I'm straight, sober.

172
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,512
Really?

173
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,479
Wow.

174
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,413
I would hate to be
sober, that sucks ass.

175
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,452
I don't see why sober
people still get to smoke.

176
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,545
Nicotine is such a drug.

177
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,851
Yeah, but nicotine doesn't
make me wander through gay bars...

178
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,984
pinching my nipples and moaning,
"pick me, pick me" to hot guys.

179
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,119
Wow.

180
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:21,427
Sounds like you did a lot
of coke or crystal or crack.

181
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,297
And now you're an AA.

182
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,768
But you don't go to crack
meetings because they're too...

183
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,998
hard core and you're just a nice
Jewish boy at heart who can only...

184
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,007
let lose when he's fucked up.

185
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,543
You have a lot of guilt which
is why you need chemicals...

186
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,203
to squelch your conscious.

187
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,411
You realize you just said
all that out loud, right?

188
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,077
Oh, I'm studying acting
so I pick up on...

189
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,280
people's personalities,
you know?

190
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,448
Guys think they're
so mysterious,

191
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:49,460
but most are just
really transparent.

192
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,293
Well I appreciate the completely
superficial deconstruction...

193
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,060
of my character but
I think I'm a little more...

194
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,566
complex than you think.

195
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,040
Hi everybody.

196
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:07,579
My name is Mary and I used
to be a bipolar crack addict.

197
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,307
But now I'm just bipolar.

198
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,882
Yeah!

199
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,546
<i>Welcome, welcome, welcome
to the midnight...</i>

200
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,678
<i>whip that crack fellowship.</i>

201
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,122
This is a crack meeting,
tonight's topic is crack.

202
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:27,662
Okay.

203
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,529
Ah...

204
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:50,915
Happy birthday.

205
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:06,664
Yeah, hello!

206
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,003
Hey honey, just calling to wish
you know who a happy Bert-day.

207
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,373
Well I'd put him on the phone
but he's in a cake hole.

208
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,311
<i>I should be reported
to the Humane Society.</i>

209
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,212
<i>Oh please, I've eaten more
than that in one sitting.</i>

210
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,807
Remember my sister's wedding,
she's still mad

211
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,443
she didn't get a piece.

212
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,679
<i>Right.</i>

213
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,779
And besides one of the many
advantages of being a dog...

214
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,721
is that get to eat like a pig.

215
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,521
Hey, fatso, ready to go on?

216
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,868
Speaking of pigs, Lou just
propositioned me again.

217
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,270
Hey, hey everybody
having a good time?

218
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,865
Let me hear you say 'yeah'!

219
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,371
All right.

220
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,745
Oh, I'm hanging by a thread here
the audiences have been really...

221
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,511
tough and I'm sweating
like Whitney Houston...

222
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,745
going though customs.

223
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:55,751
<i>Uh...</i>

224
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,583
Maybe you might want to,
you know,

225
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,089
come up with some new material,

226
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,091
you know, since
you lost the weight.

227
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,785
What are you talking about?

228
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,991
<i>Help me Rhonda, yeah,
get her out of my pants.</i>

229
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,395
Thank you.

230
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,832
Oh shit, he's singing a song.

231
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,403
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
Rhonda Gernon...</i>

232
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,337
and her fabulous fun bags.

233
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,909
Whew!

234
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,749
I know what
you're thinking.

235
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,286
Doesn't she have a pretty face?

236
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,255
And what a personality!

237
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:36,124
If only I didn't get my dresses
made by Omar the tent maker.

238
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,360
I'm so fat,
I eat with a forklift.

239
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,804
I'm so fat, when I
back up, my ass beeps.

240
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,900
<i>Fashioned from
actual ceramic chips...</i>

241
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,001
<i>recovered
at Ground Zero.</i>

242
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,377
<i>This commemorative plate will
make a fitting addition to...</i>

243
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,383
<i>your other 9/11 collectibles.</i>

244
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:37,114
<i>Featuring an American bald
eagle, look at her there</i>

245
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,656
<i>- In all her majestic glory
- Oh my God.</i>

246
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,894
<i>With a gorgeous
single cubic zirconia tear...</i>

247
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,463
<i>running down her furrowed face.</i>

248
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,758
<i>Look at that, now...</i>

249
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:47,388
Oh!

250
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,498
Geez!

251
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:53,868
Somebody...

252
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,874
Help!

253
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,777
Help me!

254
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,577
Oh my God, somebody help me!

255
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,948
Sir, animals
are not allowed here,

256
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,418
hospital policy.

257
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,011
What do you mean
'hospital policy'?!

258
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,057
You are going to have to
keep your voice down sir.

259
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,321
Now there is a very good animal
hospital over on First Avenue.

260
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,090
I'm not on First Avenue, I'm
on Tenth Avenue and there are...

261
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,759
doctors here, medical equipment,
and he has a heart and brain...

262
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,460
and lungs just like
a normal person.

263
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,367
Sir, please come with me.

264
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,939
There was an accident,
I stabbed him.

265
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,372
I stabbed him accidentally.

266
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,044
Hello.

267
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,980
<i>We have another dog
stabber down here.</i>

268
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,552
Sir the hospitals doesn't admit
animals, we have told you.

269
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:46,454
This is not an animal,
this is my child.

270
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,322
I'm a single gay man in New
York, don't you understand?!

271
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,658
Rob, Rob, it's okay.
It's okay.

272
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,062
Sir, bring the
dog on back, okay.

273
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:58,927
Thank you.

274
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,240
At least there is
still one caring person...

275
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,314
left in the
medical establishment.

276
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,381
Sir.

277
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,197
<i>What is this
National Freak Day?</i>

278
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,568
<i>We've got a lady yelling
at her vagina out there.</i>

279
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,800
Ah, the pictures are back.

280
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,972
The dog has a bruised
rib which was...

281
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,981
I'm sorry I can't hear you.

282
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,108
Oh, sorry.

283
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,918
X-rays, yeah your dog has a
bruised rib which the knife...

284
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,857
must have grazed
while it entered.

285
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,827
See there's a little clouding
in the abdomen region which...

286
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,522
we'd expect in a puncture wound.

287
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,962
Is he bleeding internally?

288
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,627
Yeah, a little, but you know
nothing life threatening.

289
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,695
Oh thank you, thank you so much.

290
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,139
I can't thank you
enough for helping us.

291
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,478
Quite all right.

292
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,343
You want to go see him now?

293
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,780
- Yeah.
- Right this way.

294
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,585
Hi, oh...

295
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,193
You know I have to say that
his fat protected him...

296
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,490
from the knife,
although in the long run...

297
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,156
you might want
to put him on a diet.

298
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,996
Oh, yeah, I don't
know why he's so fat.

299
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,807
- I'm Adam, by the way.
- Oh, I'm Doctor Hicks, Steven.

300
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,972
Are you a veterinarian?

301
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,706
Actually I'm a shrink,
I do outpatient...

302
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,782
mental health services here.

303
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,873
I went to medical school, I
was going to be a veterinarian,

304
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,419
I actually love animals.

305
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,886
Why didn't you?

306
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,890
I couldn't stand the idea of
dealing with neurotic...

307
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,460
pet owners on a daily basis.

308
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,461
Oh, sorry.

309
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,463
It's okay.

310
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,125
It is sad how people attribute
human qualities to animals...

311
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,362
instead of just eating their
flesh or wearing their fur.

312
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,675
So Adam, let's
talk about you now.

313
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,268
Me?

314
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,544
You want to tell me what
drove you to stab your dog?

315
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,415
Oh, it was an accident.

316
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:34,886
Look I love this dog
more than I love myself.

317
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,895
I know it sounds dumb,
but I'm not crazy.

318
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,965
I know you're not crazy.

319
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,261
You know actually it's
refreshing to meet somebody who

320
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,804
loves someone or
something that much.

321
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,536
Oh.

322
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,510
Hey, greetings
gay doctor roommate!

323
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:58,844
Tough day at the 'orifice'?

324
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,113
A woman who thinks God
speaks through her vagina.

325
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,653
Oh, wait, Polly?

326
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,416
Oh no...

327
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,719
no please.

328
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,851
Blond, thirties, five-eight.

329
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,486
You had sex with
a homeless woman?

330
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,758
It was kind
of sweet actually,

331
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,562
it's not the way
you make it sound.

332
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,162
For God's sake.

333
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,436
We actually cuddled a lot,
it was very intimate.

334
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,240
Yeah, well she
was probably cold.

335
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,475
You know homeless
people have needs.

336
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,108
You know they need
love like other folks.

337
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:40,754
I helped her, I provided a
service for her actually,

338
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,226
you know for five minutes her
vagina stopped talking to her.

339
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:48,356
Michael I'm going to take
a shower for both of us.

340
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,897
Well, your mother would be
happy, marrying a doctor.

341
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,267
- Is he Jewish?
- I don't think so.

342
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,365
Whatever, I'll never see
him again unless I go insane.

343
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:03,278
Adam, we're like in our
thirties, we're almost 40,

344
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,646
you need to be more aggressive.

345
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,480
Why don't you go
back to the hospital?

346
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,144
- No!
- Why not?

347
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,983
He already thinks I'm
a crazy pet person.

348
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,494
You're the only person I know
that showers before the gym.

349
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,825
Well, I need to blow
off some steam.

350
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:23,390
- Among other things.
- Uh-huh, that's right.

351
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:28,030
God, you gay guys are so lucky.

352
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,007
You get to connect
and make love...

353
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,407
to someone
different every night.

354
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,446
Yeah.

355
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,277
If women were as promiscuous
as you there'd be like

356
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,748
orgies in the street.

357
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,342
Thanks to you there already are.

358
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,287
Oh no, I brought her back here.

359
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,123
Well, have fun having
gay, anonymous sex...

360
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,924
in the low self esteem room.

361
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:56,997
Thanks.

362
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,848
Hey, you're hot,
I wish I had your body,

363
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,849
but like with my face.

364
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,347
I wish you did too.

365
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,720
God, don't you just love this
gym it feels so good to sweat

366
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,986
out the tina, you
know what I mean?

367
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:27,156
Actually I don't, I don't use
drugs and neither should you.

368
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,323
Ew!

369
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,766
It sounds like somebody had
a bad experience with drugs.

370
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,700
Excuse me?

371
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,068
No, it's okay, I'm
just really observant.

372
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,141
I notice things that
other guys might not.

373
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,368
Is that so?

374
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,273
Yeah.

375
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,969
I'm going to be an
actor so I pick up...

376
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,910
on people's personalities.

377
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,675
You don't do drugs
because you have...

378
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,445
what they call...
'control issues'.

379
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,816
You're like totally afraid to be
out of control of your body...

380
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,116
or let someone see you in a
less than perfect light.

381
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,454
You're really afraid of
letting your hair down,

382
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,050
unless it has to
do with sex,

383
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,323
and then you can
completely cut lose and...

384
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,225
Hey!

385
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,899
Sorry, sorry.

386
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,228
Ew!

387
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,995
Dogs are so gross!

388
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,067
<i>How can someone love
something that shits...</i>

389
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,402
<i>right in front of them?</i>

390
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,293
Excuse me,

391
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,861
could you eat any of
these birds if you had to?

392
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:19,706
You know, like if terrorists
poisoned the food supply.

393
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:33,288
Oh look everyone, we have a duck
in flight directly above us.

394
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,937
Oh my God!
Quick, somebody call 911!

395
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,183
Long live the NRA!

396
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,313
I am so sorry, this
usually doesn't happen.

397
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,619
Hey, you okay?

398
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,791
Yeah, I'm fine,
I just bruised a rib.

399
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,336
Oh my God, it is you.
It's you the dog guy.

400
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,268
- Hi.
- Hey.

401
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,603
Wow.
What a coincidence.

402
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:29,308
How is your dog,
speaking of bruised ribs?

403
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,041
He's all better.

404
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,346
He pees on the floor
sometimes, or is that me?

405
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,490
So what do you do,

406
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:43,390
like bird watching
tours around here?

407
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,589
Yeah, you thought you were the
only one to deal with crazies.

408
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,430
That was actually
pretty heroic of you,

409
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:54,267
you know, tackling that guy,
getting all dirty.

410
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,863
Oh well, it was heroic
of you to save my dog...

411
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,237
and I don't mind
you getting dirty.

412
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,310
Oh, I know.

413
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,436
You know, I'm really sorry, I
was such a mess at the hospital.

414
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:02,843
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

415
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,209
Here, let me do something.

416
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,873
Wait a minute, come here.

417
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,679
It's all right,
just... here.

418
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,122
Here, look at me.

419
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,595
There, that's better.

420
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,795
So listen, I'm going to be an
aggressive type person here...

421
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,666
and, uh, take you out to
dinner some time.

422
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,466
Oh, you don't have to do that.

423
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,007
- No, I want to.
- Really, it's fine.

424
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,940
- No, I want to.
- Really, it's okay.

425
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,807
- Really, I want to.
- Really, it's fine.

426
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,574
- But I want to.
- It's all right.

427
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:37,670
I'd kind of like to.

428
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,113
Oh, I don't know, it's fine.

429
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:39,945
But I'd like to.

430
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,143
Really you should...

431
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,881
I know...
let me ask you out to dinner.

432
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,889
No, that's okay.

433
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,288
No, I'm serious I want to.

434
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,257
No, you don't have to.

435
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,054
But I want to.

436
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:50,923
I'm flattered but...

437
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,462
No, really come on I want to.

438
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,054
Listen, I should take you
out to dinner to thank you...

439
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,463
for what you
did for Burt.

440
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,899
Oh...

441
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,698
if it's just
about your dog, I mean,

442
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,672
you know, it's really
not necessary.

443
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:09,736
If you're asking me on a date,
like a romantic type thing,

444
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,578
you know then I would maybe
have to say yes to such...

445
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,585
an aggressive type person.

446
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:21,755
Well it just so happens to be
a romantic date type thing,

447
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,727
so yeah, that's right.

448
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,730
- Okay.
- Okay.

449
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,424
Okay, yeah good.

450
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,067
Um.

451
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:31,897
Wow.

452
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,561
How about tomorrow night?

453
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,070
Tomorrow night's great, where?

454
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,266
Uh...

455
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,935
how about right here in the
park, you know the bath house.

456
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:41,811
The Boat House?

457
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:48,515
Um, I know, Sona.
Sona on 6th at 6.

458
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,178
Yeah, okay, great.

459
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,880
- Good.
- All right.

460
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,891
Okay, well I'll see you there.

461
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,017
- Okay.
- Okay.

462
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:56,957
- All right.
- Bye.

463
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:57,652
Bye.

464
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,193
Bye.

465
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,765
Are you sure you
want to do this?

466
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,065
Will you chill out, you
sound like a jealous wife.

467
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,731
Well you know you're going
to have to change your whole

468
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,240
lifestyle, you know.

469
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:14,743
He's got a dog, you're going
to have to hide all the knives.

470
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:18,077
Michael, it's just a date, okay.

471
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:22,381
Look, I'm 36 years old,
maybe I'm tired of one hot...

472
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,784
sexual encounter after another.

473
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,686
Maybe I want to find out what
it's like to have okay sex...

474
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,691
with the same person
on a regular basis.

475
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,493
I'm very disappointed
in you, Steve.

476
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,162
Obviously you're not the
person that I thought you were.

477
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,043
Michael, I can still see you.

478
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,750
Okay, one apple
martini, diet coke.

479
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,154
You, uh,
you don't drink?

480
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,624
No, I'm on antibiotics.

481
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:05,821
Anything... communicable?

482
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,596
Oh, no, no, nothing
communicable.

483
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,297
No, it's been awhile since
I've communicated with anyone.

484
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:17,306
You mean since uh,
since you've had sex?

485
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:18,932
How long?

486
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,271
Oh, you know,
I don't know...

487
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,175
not that long,
like six months.

488
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,550
Wow.

489
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:31,645
Although I did meet this one guy
on the phone sex line who came over,

490
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:34,919
but he lied about what
he looked like, you know.

491
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,153
When he showed up
he was like 20 years older...

492
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:42,097
and 50 pounds heavier
than he said... and short.

493
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,536
Well he was a dwarf, or a
midget, I get them confused.

494
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:49,434
Yeah.

495
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:54,136
He had crossed eyes
and burns on his face.

496
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:59,314
No ears.

497
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,282
I think he might have
been born with a hair lip,

498
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,854
but that could have been
from the fire, you know.

499
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,684
Yeah.

500
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,850
I don't think he should have lied
about those things, you know?

501
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:10,958
No.

502
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:15,428
I told him that too
right after we had sex.

503
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,129
Thank you.

504
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:30,341
You know I have to tell you I
don't go on dates very often.

505
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,713
But you know ever since I saw
you at the E.R.,

506
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,082
you seem familiar
some how?

507
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,484
Hmm.

508
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:38,850
Did you grow up on Long Island?

509
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,889
Uh-uh.

510
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,619
- Texas.
- You don't have an accent.

511
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,592
Where did you go to college?

512
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:48,996
I went to NYU briefly
but it didn't work out.

513
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:55,300
I don't know, I guess it's
just one of those things, huh?

514
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:59,069
Oh, well I was in a porn
movie once, maybe you saw it.

515
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,101
Really?

516
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,305
No.

517
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,419
Okay.

518
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,384
Really?

519
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,824
No.

520
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,589
No, no.

521
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:19,993
No.

522
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,803
So you're an ornithologist?

523
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:30,670
No, I just watch
birds for a living.

524
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,437
Yeah, business can be
slow in the winter,

525
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,513
but it's a steady paycheck and
I'm trying to keep it simple...

526
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,309
right now.

527
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,610
Keep it simple?

528
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,610
Yeah.

529
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,781
Listen, I don't
have an infection.

530
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:55,693
I'm in recovery and part of
that is being honest about that.

531
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,997
Good for you, Adam.
Good for you.

532
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,866
Listen I deal
with a lot of people...

533
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,769
who have addictive
personalities.

534
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,967
Hey, wake up, it's not
over till the fat lady sings...

535
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,841
and I ain't sung yet.

536
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:17,315
Boy, tough crowd.

537
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,084
Remember ladies and gentlemen,
if you throw any...

538
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,024
wilted vegetables
I will simply eat them.

539
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,197
Although pork
ribs are my favorite,

540
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,095
feel free to throw those.

541
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,565
Isn't it funny how the
more ribs you eat...

542
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,829
the less you
can see of your own?

543
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,998
You know,
I know her, I think.

544
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,575
Are those chocolate covered
crickets I hear in the audience?

545
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,614
- Yeah.
- She was funny.

546
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,314
Well you're sweet to say
that but really she wasn't.

547
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,687
Ah, thanks for coming.

548
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,259
Yeah.

549
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,954
Ah, what a shitty
audience, right?

550
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,257
This is Steve.

551
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,299
Oh, the doctor with the heart
of gold, nice to meet you.

552
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,733
I know you, right, don't I?

553
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,237
Well, I was just on stage.

554
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,565
Wait a minute.

555
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,108
Oh my God.

556
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,736
Marie's...
Marie's Crisis.

557
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,644
- You're the cocktail waitress...
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

558
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,943
I work there on weekends,
this place doesn't really pay,

559
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:20,745
so...

560
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,615
Right, I guess
you don't recognize me.

561
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,881
I'm too self absorbed
to notice other people.

562
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,014
I'm sorry did you say something?

563
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,229
Okay.

564
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,862
Excuse me I'm going
to take care of some business.

565
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,440
Okay.

566
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,508
He's so cute.

567
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,634
I know, I know he's
so cute and we've been...

568
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:47,802
having like the best time.

569
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,073
Like the more I talk to him the
more it's like I've known him...

570
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,205
my whole life.

571
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,339
Past lives.

572
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,178
Yeah.

573
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,048
You're about as funny
as a heart attack.

574
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,712
Oh, thanks dad!

575
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,121
Okay, well here I am.

576
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,296
Oh.

577
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,695
What!

578
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,427
Well aren't you worried about
getting gay bashed or yelled at?

579
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,970
No!

580
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,767
No, my God nothing like
that's ever happened to me.

581
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,104
Yeah, it's just like every time
I expressed affection in public...

582
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,542
some asshole from Jersey
throws a beer bottle at me.

583
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,205
Wow.

584
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,011
Sounds like you've
had really bad luck.

585
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,626
Oh... Burt, Burt,
Burt, look at you.

586
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,722
Give me five!
Hey!

587
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,232
Look at you, you're
all better now.

588
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,276
Oh!

589
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,863
Did you come?

590
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,959
No, I think your dog
is licking my foot.

591
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,764
Oh.

592
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,430
Burt, go to your bed, go!

593
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,909
I'm sorry.

594
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,537
I don't think he understands
what's happening to his daddy.

595
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,547
Do you understand what's
happening to his daddy?

596
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:40,955
No.

597
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:49,162
- Yes, yeah.
- Come here.

598
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,706
<i>Bells will ring,
and angels sing.</i>

599
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:08,144
<i>there's something
in the air.</i>

600
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:11,847
<i>Cupid brings
the start of spring,</i>

601
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,517
<i>with something to declare.</i>

602
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,821
<i>And now it's
love, love, love...</i>

603
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:22,763
<i>So delightfully, it's
love, love, love, love, love.</i>

604
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:31,899
<i>Romeo was smitten,
Aphrodite bitten.</i>

605
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,843
<i>Juliet was reeling,
now I know the feeling.</i>

606
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,814
<i>My heart's palpatatin',
hyperventilatin',</i>

607
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:43,478
<i>#from the kissing and the smackin',
aphrodisiacking.</i>

608
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,283
<i>I'm in
love, love, love.</i>

609
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,794
<i>What a gas to be in love,
love, love, love, love.</i>

610
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:55,730
<i>Love, love,
love, like it has to be,</i>

611
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,927
<i>in love, love,
love, love, love.</i>

612
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:04,100
<i>Who'd of thought that you and
me'd be talking L-O-V-E?</i>

613
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:08,304
<i>You can guarantee
that we both agree.</i>

614
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,437
<i>I know it seems askew,</i>

615
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:14,245
<i>and relatively new to me,
you'll say I do</i>

616
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,220
<i>because we're both in
love, love, love.</i>

617
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:23,191
<i>What a gas to be in love,
love, love, love, love.</i>

618
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:27,594
<i>Love, love, love,
like it has to be</i>

619
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,792
<i>in love, love,
love, love, love.</i>

620
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,803
<i>Two ships in the night,</i>

621
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,565
<i>became a cruise
ship of delight,</i>

622
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:39,575
<i>on an ocean of anomoniquity.</i>

623
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,508
<i>The owl is on the prowl</i>

624
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:43,512
<i>and though the
pussycat did scowl.</i>

625
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:47,243
<i>She winked her eye and
said come sail with me.</i>

626
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:56,550
<i>And then
it's love, love, love.</i>

627
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,597
<i>So delightfully it's love,
love, love, love, love.</i>

628
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:05,601
<i>Love, love, love
it's so right for me</i>

629
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:09,571
<i>in love, love,
love, love, love.</i>

630
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:13,131
<i>Love, love, love.</i>

631
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:17,476
<i>Love, love, love.</i>

632
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,745
<i>Love, love, love...</i>

633
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:26,345
You know I actually wanted
to be a dancer at one point.

634
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,788
Really?

635
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,884
I was a theatre major,
couldn't deal with Bohemia,

636
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,361
such a messy lifestyle,
very, very messy.

637
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,431
What are you doing?

638
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:35,499
What are you doing?

639
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,363
When was your last relationship?

640
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:43,099
Um, by relationship what
exactly do you mean?

641
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:49,613
Your last boyfriend, lover,
homosexual lifetime...

642
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,408
commitment partner companion?

643
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,982
I've never really
had a long term one.

644
00:40:56,086 --> 00:41:00,489
No one's really held my interest
for that long, you know?

645
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,422
Great.

646
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,324
No, wait a minute,
wait a minute, now.

647
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,261
You know when I was a kid
I figured I'd grow up,

648
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,958
meet a nice guy,
have a big wedding.

649
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:15,095
It all had to be a
certain way, you know.

650
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,697
Like in the movies I'd seen.

651
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,503
Yeah, me too.

652
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,578
You know, I'd always watch those
movies and I'd superimpose...

653
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,670
myself over the man
and then the woman,

654
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,840
you know,
I'd go back and forth.

655
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,976
Like in one scene I'd be Julia
Roberts and then in the next...

656
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:32,578
scene I'd be, you know
like Julia Roberts.

657
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:36,249
Really?

658
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,021
I'm Meg Ryan.

659
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,028
Hi Meg.

660
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,688
Yeah, you're blonde.

661
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,768
Ah, Julia come on.

662
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,871
Hey, you ever gone
gay two stepping over...

663
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,635
at the Big Apple Rodeo
in Midtown?

664
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,972
Two stepping, no I
can barely one step.

665
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,841
What do you wear to
something like that?

666
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,576
Oh my God, it's ho-down.

667
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:15,996
All right come
here, come here, come here.

668
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,192
I don't know how to do this.

669
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,201
Relax, okay, it's really easy.

670
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:23,433
All you do, okay look at this,
you go, quick quick step, step.

671
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,634
Quick, quick step,
step, exactly.

672
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,608
It's just a repetition of the
same move except we're...

673
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,110
going to be going that way,
all right?

674
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,510
- Okay.
- Ready, here we go.

675
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,105
And quick, quick step.
Good.

676
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,411
Quick, quick, exactly.

677
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:34,882
Ow!

678
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,680
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry.

679
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,654
It's okay, sorry, let's
keep going all right?

680
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,692
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

681
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:47,389
It's all right, look you'll
get the hang of it, all right.

682
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,022
Let's just keep
going, here we go.

683
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,727
Here we go, and
quick, quick step.

684
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:52,597
Good.

685
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,069
That's good.

686
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,538
Hey, Steve.

687
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:01,110
Hey, Andy.

688
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:04,840
This is uh... Adam.

689
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,975
Looks like someone's having
a little bit of trouble here.

690
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,680
Yeah, well I'm Jewish,
you know give me a bottle dance...

691
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:12,983
and I'm fine.

692
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,958
Well, I teach private lessons,
so if you ever want to take it...

693
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:20,394
seriously at all,
you just let me know.

694
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,022
Actually, Andy is a
really great instructor.

695
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,830
Not that you ever
needed any instructing.

696
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,064
Your dancing's not bad either.

697
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,403
Shalom cowboy...

698
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,479
Oh my God,
I'm terrible at this.

699
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:46,249
No, you just started, now
come on, try and relax.

700
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,585
All right, here we go.

701
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,959
Now, this is much better.

702
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,837
This is just like any slow song.

703
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,876
That's right, except in heels.

704
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,439
I tried to be a
good dancer once.

705
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,039
What happened?

706
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,518
Have you ever been
to a sober dance?

707
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,749
I hate to point this out
but dancing is 90% beer.

708
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,285
What about dirty dancing?

709
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,030
Wow, you're
in a mood.

710
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,569
You're like a different
person tonight.

711
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:37,038
Well, I'm happy.
I'm dating someone.

712
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,438
That guy Andy is really hot.

713
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:43,710
I guess.

714
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:47,875
But uh...
he's not my boyfriend.

715
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,878
You are.

716
00:44:55,292 --> 00:45:00,320
<i>Never did I know
I'd feel the way I do.</i>

717
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:05,425
<i>You changed my
life in so many ways.</i>

718
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:09,632
<i>And the moment that
we kissed, you showed me...</i>

719
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,710
<i>You sure he said boyfriend?</i>

720
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:17,804
<i>He didn't say, boy
do I need a friend?</i>

721
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,246
Yeah, I don't know
what to say to him.

722
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,546
You know I look at him sometimes
and I have these feelings like...

723
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,713
I cherish him, but then
I always feel like I'm waiting...

724
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,053
for the other shoe to drop
like it always has.

725
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:31,525
He seems to be moving awfully
fast for a psychiatrist.

726
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:34,722
I mean the whole idea of this
romantic myth stuff is a recipe...

727
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,392
for disaster, he's a
shrink, he should know this.

728
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,128
Yeah, he is a shrink.

729
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,228
I think he knows more
about this stuff than us.

730
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,830
He has a degree,
we just have Oprah.

731
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,373
Oprah has made it impossible
for me to have a close...

732
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,880
relationship with
anyone, besides Oprah.

733
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:55,247
He's so normal and
I'm just, I'm such a freak.

734
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,518
We're really different.

735
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:00,055
I think that's good.

736
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:03,718
The thing about you gay guys
is that you're just obsessed...

737
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,522
with finding carbon
copies of yourself.

738
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,621
At least with guys and girls
we know we'll never figure...

739
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:12,224
each other out so we just say,
"Oh, he's just being a man"

740
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,804
or "Oh, she's just on the rag."

741
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,463
I guess.

742
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,638
Have you had a fight yet?

743
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:20,675
No.

744
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,304
Is that weird?

745
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:27,178
Well you do have some
things in common,

746
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,878
he 'two-steps' and
you 'twelve-step'.

747
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,487
You know maybe your
comedy is like my love life.

748
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:39,494
You know if you stop trying so
hard it will come, you know?

749
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:44,898
But fat jokes are my forte
and being fat is the only...

750
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,266
funny thing that
ever happened to me.

751
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:53,709
It's the only... thing some
idiot off the street...

752
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,870
would find
interesting about me.

753
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,159
Who are these for?

754
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:14,719
My friends Jeff and Jeff are
bringing their new foster child.

755
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,493
Ah, kids.

756
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,830
I saw some of those on TV once.

757
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:21,302
Ever think about having kids?

758
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:24,397
No, I already have one, myself.

759
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,738
I love children.

760
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,835
I can't imagine anybody
not loving kids.

761
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,174
Would you stop it?

762
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:31,579
Come here.

763
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:36,211
Hello.

764
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,412
<i>Hi!</i>

765
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,684
Hi. I'm Michael.

766
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,691
So Steve tells me
you used to be fat?

767
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:51,393
Oh Adam told me you
used to be short.

768
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,529
Were you like fat
or... circus fat?

769
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,277
You know you really ought to be
standing when you insult a lady.

770
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,971
Oh, wait, you already are.

771
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,882
What did you do with
all that loose skin,

772
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:12,285
did you like donate it to
a burn unit or something?

773
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,881
No, I gave it to the little
people, the real little people,

774
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,587
not the fake little
people like you.

775
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,363
Wow.

776
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,303
Cute kid, huh?

777
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,433
Wonder if she's gay.

778
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:41,782
Look, I just wanted to let you
know that I think it's cool...

779
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:45,514
that you and Steve are
hanging out and you know,

780
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,147
doing your gay love thing.

781
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,750
Awe, thanks Michael,
that's sweet.

782
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,022
Yeah.

783
00:48:55,832 --> 00:49:01,998
I just, you know before he
met you he was such a whore.

784
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,699
Sorry, whore's get paid.

785
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:06,867
He was a slut.

786
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:11,073
He used to go to like the gym
every night and just go in...

787
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,877
the shower and hook up with
like hundreds of guys,

788
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:17,078
like the hottest guys in
New York for the taking.

789
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:21,647
To be honest with you, I can
never really understand...

790
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:26,422
why he would like give
up all that easy lovemaking,

791
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,191
but you know I
understand that you,

792
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,426
you know guys want
equal rights, so.

793
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,804
<i>Your best friend is cute.</i>

794
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,272
She's kind of a
bitch though, right?

795
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,074
Yeah.

796
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,045
What time do your folks get in?

797
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,847
They should be here
in about an hour.

798
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,649
Did you put away Michael's porn?

799
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:53,745
Yeah.

800
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,017
Did you put away Michael?

801
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:58,185
He's at a three stooges
convention at the Javitz Center.

802
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:00,092
Oh, I hope they like me.

803
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,256
Honey, you'll be fine.

804
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:04,391
They're the ones that should be
worried about what you think,

805
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,866
they're entering our world.

806
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,231
When you're
a born again Christian...

807
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,565
your world follows you.

808
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,230
Yeah, but they're not
that religious anymore.

809
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,399
Look, I've been
out for ten years,

810
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,136
they've had plenty of time
to get used to the idea...

811
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,735
that eventually
I'd meet somebody, huh?

812
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,251
Ew, Fags!

813
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:32,621
Welcome to the West Village
asshole, better get used to it!

814
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,671
Asshole.

815
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:53,041
You know, Jesus was a Jew.

816
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,744
That's right, he sure was.

817
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:58,753
Uh, would anybody care
for some wine?

818
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,186
That would be delightful.

819
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,656
Open that box of
Zinfandel we brought.

820
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,554
Show him what we
bought at the airport.

821
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:17,203
Now it's not for dinner,
it's just for decoration.

822
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:22,711
It was made from actual ceramic
chips recovered from the site.

823
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:23,939
Here we go.

824
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:28,143
Mom, dad, here we are.

825
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,548
Don't you want some?

826
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,518
Oh, no I'm an alcoholic.

827
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:34,146
He's in recovery.

828
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,796
Excuse us for a
minute, mom, dad.

829
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,498
I feel like I have a sign
under my neck that reads,

830
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,067
"I eat your son's ass".

831
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:48,626
Look, stop it, just act
like you normally do, okay?

832
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,535
We have to show them that there's
nothing wrong with being gay.

833
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,803
Look, they're in New
York now, not Texas.

834
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:57,175
Good lordy these
windows are so big!

835
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,214
I feel like I could
just fall right out.

836
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,183
Not exactly a ton of
privacy though is there?

837
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:14,090
Mom, dad, I just wanted to say
that normally Adam and I are...

838
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:20,102
very affectionate with each
other and we don't feel that...

839
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:25,038
it would be fair to us, or really
to you if we behaved in a way...

840
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:30,705
that somehow demonstrated that
we are in any way ashamed...

841
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,681
of our feelings for each other.

842
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,377
I think it's important that
we express our normal healthy...

843
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,944
affection for each
other in your presence.

844
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:44,583
Right?
And um, um...

845
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,030
Well, I just
wanted to say that.

846
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,392
Oh, well.

847
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:57,804
Don't not be ya'lls usual
selves, just cause we're here!

848
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,176
Yes.

849
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,205
We're all grown ups here.

850
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,583
Ew, fags!

851
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,660
So how would a person
find curtains for...

852
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,631
a window so big, son?

853
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:30,634
Well, you know, New York
is a very big city so...

854
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,231
<i>Cornholers!!</i>

855
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,008
How's that wine,
any left?

856
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,243
We don't have any
more boxes of wine,

857
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,343
I can open an actual bottle.

858
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,854
<i>Cocksuckers!!</i>

859
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,184
Cock screw's right
there on the counter.

860
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:52,627
Cork!

861
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,330
Got it, right here.

862
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:06,900
<i>Oh.</i>

863
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,653
Ah, I'm never having sex again.

864
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,312
No, they'll be fine.

865
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,650
No, they really liked you.

866
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,585
As your dad was leaving he
told me I was going to hell.

867
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,425
Yeah, well he only tries to
save the people he likes.

868
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,827
How come you never
talk about your family?

869
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,995
What are they, in the witness
protection program or something?

870
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,938
Uh, my family is really weird.

871
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,503
<i>They're not lucky.</i>

872
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,943
Adam, there's no such
thing as luck, okay?

873
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,912
Ah, yeah, there is.

874
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,384
Listen if you want to
meet them you can...

875
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,545
come with me to Hannukah
dinner in a few months.

876
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:54,749
If you still like me.

877
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,483
If I still like you?

878
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,898
Yeah, I know I'm just
making an assumption there.

879
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:07,464
Adam, come on.

880
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:10,899
I more than like you.

881
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,675
- Adam...
- I love you.

882
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,579
You just had to say
it first, didn't you?

883
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:24,780
I'm sorry, it's easier for
me to say it than to hear it.

884
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:28,847
Adam, I love you.

885
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,290
I love you.

886
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:36,020
I love, I love,
I love, love, love you...

887
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:43,199
Adam,
I do, I love you.

888
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,361
<i>Hey, it's Steve,
I am ridiculously in love</i>

889
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,022
<i>and therefore
extremely unreachable,</i>

890
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:11,930
<i>but leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

891
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,884
All right, this next comic
used to be really fat.

892
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:40,895
Which means now her pussy's
probably really tight because

893
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:43,522
no one's ever been in there.

894
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,294
<i>She's the hottest female
comic this side of...</i>

895
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:48,701
I can't think of any
hot female comics.

896
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:51,433
But even if you don't think
she's funny, and she's not,

897
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:55,068
then just turn her around
and look upon Rhonda Gernan...

898
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,669
and her amazing
heart shaped ass.

899
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,779
Thank you.
Wow.

900
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,222
You know, Lou, I always
knew you were crazy,

901
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:13,523
but in those pants I can see
your nuts and they're sad.

902
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,066
They're sad because
there's no one up there.

903
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:20,694
No pork, just beans.

904
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,602
No sausage for your
country breakfast.

905
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,136
No condiments for your meat.

906
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:32,445
No relish, no sauce.

907
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:35,040
Lou's so small.
Ask me how small he is?

908
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,150
<i>How small is he?</i>

909
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:38,880
Lou's so small his
last girlfriend...

910
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:40,683
was a pencil sharpener.

911
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,049
<i>Lou's so small
he doesn't get crabs,</i>

912
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,320
<i>he dates them.</i>

913
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:50,793
Lou's so small if he were a
drink he'd be a no pia colada.

914
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:53,835
<i>Knock, knock.</i>

915
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:55,097
Who's there?

916
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,338
Oh, I don't see anything,
I guess it's Lou's penis.

917
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:07,611
Well obviously there's
one man in the audience...

918
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:09,617
who's secure enough
with his masculinity...

919
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,380
to laugh at my jokes.

920
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,660
Hey.
Thanks for coming.

921
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:24,755
Oh yeah.

922
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,301
And laughing.

923
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:28,302
Yeah, hi.

924
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,971
You're, you're funny.

925
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,544
I just got fired.

926
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,546
All Lou did was complement
you on your ass,

927
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,445
why did you make fun of him?

928
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,518
Because in this heart
shaped ass is an asshole...

929
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,814
which is, I guess, what I am.

930
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,156
Gross.

931
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:50,226
It's good to see you have
fun with Gloria Steinam here.

932
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,161
You know I'm not with her,
she just sat next to me.

933
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,293
I'm not your mother.

934
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,495
Oh, well you kind
of look like her.

935
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,037
Well, that's good.

936
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:08,600
I'm late I've got to go
stare into a black hole.

937
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,838
You know I don't see
Steve as often as I used to...

938
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:12,881
ever since he
hooked up with Adam.

939
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,712
I think they're completely
wrong for each other.

940
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,217
Don't you agree?

941
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,878
Oh, come on their fags!

942
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:20,512
You know how it is.

943
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,955
Besides I think it's good,
Adam's luck has completely

944
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,893
changed since they met.
Why am I talking to you?

945
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:30,698
Hey, you want to get
a drink or something?

946
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,563
Like, it's so early.

947
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,966
You want to get a hot totty?

948
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,869
I try not to drink.

949
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:40,670
You don't get thirsty? You
know your body is 90% water.

950
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:42,369
Booze, it's the carbs!

951
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,809
Oh, right.

952
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,142
Are there
carbohydrates in pot?

953
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,091
Oh.

954
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,290
Wow, public access.

955
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:06,664
Do you believe they
get away with that?

956
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:19,838
Oh, hey look, American
Movie Classics.

957
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,713
You like that don't you?

958
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:24,787
Isn't it funny how the only
requirements for them to be...

959
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,913
a classic is that it
be over 40 years old.

960
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,151
I never thought of that.

961
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:35,661
You're funny.

962
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,324
Funny lady.

963
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:40,732
Oh my God,
I love that movie.

964
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:43,601
Oh my God me too, Steve makes
me watch it all the time,

965
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:49,702
except I think 'Funny Girl'
is much more satisfying.

966
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,337
Well, I think that's
the common opinion.

967
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:54,109
Yeah, that's the
common opinion...

968
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,191
Mmmm.

969
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:06,784
I've got the munchies.

970
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,983
My God what are you
doing, I can't eat that!

971
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:32,646
Oh, you can't have one pie?

972
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:34,848
<i>No I can't have one pie!</i>

973
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,050
One pie is like an
appetizer to me.

974
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,458
I eat that,
I unleash the beast!

975
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:45,764
Well then come on Rhonda,
unleash the beast!

976
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,666
I had a slip.

977
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,975
<i>- Thanks gents, have a good night.
- Thank you.</i>

978
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:41,716
All right, okay.

979
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,993
Ah, you know I don't think
this is such a good idea.

980
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,691
What is the big deal?
Look you met my parents...

981
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,358
I want to meet yours.

982
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:53,594
All I'm saying is that they're...

983
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:56,137
I know, I know
they're not lucky.

984
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,139
They're kind of cursed.

985
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:00,937
Well if they're anything as
dramatic as their son Adam,

986
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:03,341
focus, okay, relax.

987
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,277
You always exaggerate
everything.

988
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:06,370
Go.

989
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:08,313
Go in!

990
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,281
Okay?

991
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,545
Go, it's okay.

992
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:18,958
Hello.

993
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,790
We're here.

994
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:22,797
Welcome home!

995
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:30,299
Darn it, we just replaced
that thing last week.

996
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:31,703
Happy Hannukah.

997
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:43,277
Whoa!

998
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:46,443
You must be Steve.

999
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:47,284
Hi.

1000
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,483
Welcome, welcome,
welcome, welcome.

1001
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:55,292
I'm Adam's father, I'm Norm and
this is Sherry and this is...

1002
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,059
our beautiful daughter Ruth.

1003
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,929
Hi, it's so nice to meet...
Ooh!

1004
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:02,027
Uh-oh, did you bite your
tongue again sweetie?

1005
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:03,162
Mm-hmm.

1006
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:05,774
Hi.

1007
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,708
Hi, Ruth, Mr., Mrs. Bernstein.

1008
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,335
Thank you for having me.

1009
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,980
Please call me Sherry,
any boyfriend of Adam's...

1010
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,847
is a boyfriend of mine.

1011
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,682
And that's right.

1012
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:20,483
It's getting a little rare
having this one come around...

1013
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,319
and visit us once in awhile.

1014
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,790
I think he's
just a little embarrassed...

1015
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,861
about the Bernstein curse.

1016
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:28,931
Dad, there is no such thing.

1017
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,364
You like that?
Are you enjoying?

1018
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:37,837
<i>Mmm.</i>

1019
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,271
<i>Steve, matza?</i>

1020
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,172
Oh, yes, thank
you very much sir.

1021
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:43,810
Thank you.

1022
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,748
Seven more.

1023
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:54,652
I thought that
was shatter proof.

1024
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:56,019
All right.

1025
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,353
I'm sorry, I just
have to ask this,

1026
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:00,588
but are all of you
okay with this?

1027
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:03,324
Well, I used to charge
people a quarter...

1028
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:05,093
every time they asked
us that question,

1029
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:06,725
but nobody
could afford it.

1030
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,997
Lowered it to a nickel and
it still broke practically...

1031
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:10,868
everybody's bank.

1032
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:14,101
Happiness is accepting
life on life's terms.

1033
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:17,304
You know I mean no matter
what they happen to be.

1034
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:21,372
You just do your best with
what you've been given.

1035
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:24,248
Till we found out we
were luck challenged,

1036
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,652
we thought there was a
poltergeist or something.

1037
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,624
We were on 'In Search Of'
in the 70s...

1038
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:32,284
you know, with Spock.

1039
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:35,489
Oh, we still have the tape,
we'll show it to you...

1040
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:36,963
after we light the menorah.

1041
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,162
Mom, could we
get through a Hannukah...

1042
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,701
without watching that tape?

1043
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:43,101
Adam just hates that tape,
he was a real pizza face...

1044
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:44,536
back then you know.

1045
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,234
Too busy with all that
white face paint to clear.

1046
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:48,742
Anybody want coffee?

1047
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,813
White face paint?

1048
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:54,906
I was a goth in high school.

1049
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,508
Who would like coffee?

1050
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,917
Oh!

1051
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,648
Well, we're out of coffee.

1052
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,828
Uh, it's okay, it's kind
of late for coffee anyway.

1053
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,268
You know what?

1054
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:17,032
Let's spin the draidle
and open presents.

1055
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,436
Yeah!

1056
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:23,276
Well, now that you
have a special friend

1057
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,540
I want to see more
of you around here.

1058
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:26,444
Dad!

1059
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:30,645
Steve is Adam's lover.
God, you are so square.

1060
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:36,783
Oh, it was such a pleasure to
meet you Steve... oh, thank you.

1061
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:42,489
I'm so happy that my Adam has
found someone as nice as you.

1062
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:45,897
Oh, Sherry, look thanks
for making me feel so welcome,

1063
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,129
and oh, for
such an amazing meal.

1064
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,137
Well, it was made with love.

1065
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,570
You know, I hate to see
you waste money

1066
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,108
taking a taxi
to the train station.

1067
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,041
Don't you want us
to give you a ride?

1068
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,442
No!

1069
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:59,241
Thank you, no.

1070
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:38,911
I love you.

1071
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:55,404
<i>Why can't a lesbian
diet and put on makeup...</i>

1072
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:56,835
<i>at the same time?</i>

1073
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:57,963
<i>I don't know, why?</i>

1074
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:01,510
Cause you can't eat Jenny Craig
with Mary Kay on your face.

1075
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,877
Does anyone know
what mothballs smell like?

1076
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:08,176
Yes.

1077
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:11,879
Oh really, how did you get them
to spread their little legs?

1078
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,380
I have an audition
for a lesbian cruise ship...

1079
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,983
next week,
very excited about it.

1080
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:22,155
I like lesbians,
lesbians like me.

1081
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,698
Trying to cut down on
the fat jokes though.

1082
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,530
Mm, I still can't
even imagine you fat.

1083
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:30,264
Oh, I can, oh, honey, show
Steve that photo of you.

1084
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:31,229
No!

1085
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,703
Yeah, come on.

1086
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:35,902
No, I look like
a Long Island blimp...

1087
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:38,479
with a bad
Chinese lady perm.

1088
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:39,513
No.

1089
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,914
Speaking of Long Island, you
know we went to Long Island...

1090
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,851
last week, we went to
Adam's parents' house.

1091
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,947
Oh my God, I was there
once and a piece of space lab...

1092
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:51,026
splashed down into their pool.

1093
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,994
Oh my God!

1094
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:55,961
Actually...

1095
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,597
I'm going to
ask Adam to marry me.

1096
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,466
Oh my God!

1097
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:03,833
You're going to marry him!

1098
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,305
But you guys have only been
going out for a couple months.

1099
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,239
Actually it's almost
been a year Michael,

1100
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,403
besides my parents got
married on the third date...

1101
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:11,741
and they're still together.

1102
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:13,508
Well you're only as
monogamous as your options.

1103
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:16,414
I mean your parents live in
a trailer park in a field.

1104
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:17,349
Excuse me!

1105
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:20,013
Only as monogamous
as their options!

1106
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:22,784
You know it gets worse Michael,
I'm going to ask him to move in.

1107
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:24,450
Oh my God!

1108
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,352
I knew this day
was going to come.

1109
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:30,193
You know you said you needed a
place to crash for the night...

1110
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:32,767
and you've been living on
my couch for five years.

1111
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:34,859
Jesus, Michael, be
happy for them.

1112
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:38,702
I think it's great.

1113
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,638
He's going to flip out.

1114
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:42,404
He really loves you.

1115
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,570
I love him too, I do.

1116
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:48,806
You know it's funny when I was
a kid I just supposed I'd get

1117
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,910
married like everybody
else, but I don't know,

1118
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:55,513
turned out I was gay and I just
figured it wasn't in the cards.

1119
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:58,058
But I mean I don't even know
what I think of marriage anyway.

1120
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,253
Sometimes I think it's
a dying institution.

1121
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:03,559
Yeah, well it is,
then you fall in love.

1122
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:04,655
Exactly.

1123
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,160
Sometimes I look
at him and I think,

1124
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:11,364
this is not the person I
was supposed to end up with,

1125
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:16,137
but I don't know,
somehow it's all okay.

1126
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,109
So who gets to wear the dress?

1127
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,410
You do.

1128
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:31,350
Hi.

1129
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,893
Hey, good lookin'.

1130
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:35,586
Hey.

1131
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:37,928
Wait a minute, come
here, come here.

1132
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:48,399
I um, I want to take
you someplace. Okay?

1133
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,273
Oh God, please don't tell me
there's something...

1134
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:51,846
called three stepping.

1135
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:57,080
No, it's just my favorite
place in the city.

1136
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:58,118
You game?

1137
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,448
Yeah.

1138
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,917
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1139
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:17,767
The Brooklyn Bridge,
that's your favorite place?

1140
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:18,669
Uh huh.

1141
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:21,572
Let's go, come on, come on!

1142
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,445
God, I haven't
been here in years,

1143
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:36,456
it's getting harder to remember
where the towers were, you know?

1144
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:41,753
You were in New York on
that day, what was it like?

1145
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:47,234
Oh, I don't know,
it was just crazy.

1146
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:51,830
These are crazy times, makes
things like, I don't know,

1147
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,807
security, commitment,
more important.

1148
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,175
I can't believe
that you brought me here.

1149
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:07,414
My drug problem began
on this very spot.

1150
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:10,287
Well, no, actually it
began at Danceateria,

1151
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:11,984
this club in the 80's.

1152
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:15,689
This go-go boy coke head with
big old like Dee Snyder hair.

1153
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:19,256
He was part of some dance
troop, what was it called?

1154
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:21,165
Oh, the Dazzle Dancers.

1155
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,761
Well he fed me my first hit
of blow and we went back to

1156
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:29,435
my place and he shit right in
front of me, all over my carpet.

1157
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,105
Oh, my place looked like
something out of

1158
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:34,239
Willy Wonka after he left.

1159
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:37,946
Oh, and he was singing
some song from the...

1160
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,918
what was it from?

1161
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,014
<i>Like the Sound of Music.</i>

1162
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,126
Oh my God, how could
I have forgotten that?

1163
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:55,360
Oh my God.

1164
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,702
Oh my Jesus, oh my God.

1165
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:00,468
Honey.

1166
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:03,238
Oh my God.

1167
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:07,714
I have to get out of here,
all I can see is disaster.

1168
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,078
No, disaster!

1169
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:11,685
I need time to think Adam!

1170
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:13,277
Time to think!

1171
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,583
Think!

1172
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:21,526
Where are you going?

1173
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:26,093
So he just ran away
yelling "disaster"?

1174
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:26,997
Yeah.

1175
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:28,660
We were talking about
the World Trade Center...

1176
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:30,739
and what happened
and he just freaked out.

1177
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,305
Well, he is a doctor
in New York City.

1178
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,845
He was in Province Town on 9/11.

1179
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:42,477
Well, he'll call you
when he's ready.

1180
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:44,245
Everybody gets the
jitters before.

1181
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:49,290
Before what?

1182
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:50,983
The next big terrorist attack.

1183
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:25,651
Uh!

1184
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:26,785
Oh!!

1185
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:30,357
He just dumped me!

1186
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,160
What!

1187
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:32,028
In the shower.

1188
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,624
Oh my God!

1189
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:34,861
There ain't no God!

1190
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,198
Did he say why?

1191
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,034
Just that,
he wasn't ready...

1192
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,938
and he said I didn't
really know who he was!

1193
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,841
Oh my God, why is
this happening?

1194
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:45,777
It's the Bernstein curse!

1195
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:57,483
You know, you date...

1196
01:14:57,593 --> 01:15:00,858
You look for the person who has
the least amount of flaws...

1197
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,555
and then you find someone
who you think is about...

1198
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,188
as perfect as you can get.

1199
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:06,927
Oh, but of course there's
no such thing as perfection.

1200
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:09,595
Why do people project this
image of themselves...

1201
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:12,606
that's like completely
opposite from who they are?

1202
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,801
Maybe they're just
afraid they won't be...

1203
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:17,344
loved for who
they really are.

1204
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:19,441
But that's crazy.

1205
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:24,877
I mean you come home one day and
you think you know this person...

1206
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:26,454
and then all of a sudden
you realize you do not...

1207
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,489
know this person from Adam.

1208
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:32,487
I need to speak
with Steven Hicks.

1209
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:33,652
Are you one of his patients?

1210
01:15:33,762 --> 01:15:35,491
Don't make me go
Shirley McClaine on you.

1211
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:37,963
You better give that guy some
closure or he's going to...

1212
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,727
wind up in here
in a body cast.

1213
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,769
Look, look, I appreciate you
standing up for your friend,

1214
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:44,065
but I did give Adam
closure, all right?

1215
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:45,537
In a shower stall.

1216
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,973
All right, okay, I admit it
was perhaps a little abrupt...

1217
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:49,304
but what in the world...

1218
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:50,901
One minute you're telling
me you want to marry him,

1219
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:52,503
all that bullshit
about commitment...

1220
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:53,911
and you're a total slut.

1221
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,643
Look, you don't understand
the situation, okay?

1222
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:57,412
There are things about me you
just don't know, all right?

1223
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:59,009
Like what?

1224
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:02,579
Like... we just aren't
right for each other.

1225
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:03,680
We...

1226
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,282
He doesn't really love me.

1227
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,555
We were co-dependent and then...

1228
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:09,096
There are things
about being co-de,

1229
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:12,530
it's called depending
on another person.

1230
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:15,034
You act like you're so grown up
like you're so above it,

1231
01:16:15,137 --> 01:16:19,437
but you're an
asshole and a baby.

1232
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:22,476
You're an asshole
who's also a baby!

1233
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:27,779
I'm getting marriage advice
from some gay whore, great.

1234
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,452
All right, let me
get this straight.

1235
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:36,649
You meet Adam in 1987.

1236
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:42,493
You turn him into a coke head
and then you poop on him.

1237
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:44,925
All in the same night?

1238
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:46,728
It wasn't my fault.

1239
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,203
It was cut with...

1240
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:53,240
baby laxative.

1241
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:56,834
I've had some bad dates
but nothing like,

1242
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,674
you know, biohazard.

1243
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,714
How could we have
dated for so long...

1244
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:03,614
and never recognized
each other?

1245
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:06,916
Oh, it was the 80s,
it was a long time ago.

1246
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:13,320
You know you're like
Simon LeBon, in a boat,

1247
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:17,057
looking through the jungle for
the cat lady and you know...

1248
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:21,625
he was like the guy with a fiddle
and the suspenders singing;

1249
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:23,898
"Come On Eileen".

1250
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:30,267
Or you could just...

1251
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,472
You could tell
him who you were.

1252
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:35,744
No, no Michael.
No, he can't find out.

1253
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:40,345
Michael don't you dare say
a word to him, or Rhonda.

1254
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:42,150
Michael, do you hear me?

1255
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,225
I told you, I don't know,
I just know that he said...

1256
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,358
Adam isn't the one.

1257
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:54,901
- Michael.
- What?

1258
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:56,369
Michael.

1259
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:01,570
Michael,
is that the whole story?

1260
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,773
Well, there's the other thing.

1261
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,080
What?

1262
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,643
What other thing, Michael.

1263
01:18:12,754 --> 01:18:15,120
About Adam and Steve.

1264
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:19,958
It's kind of gross, I think I
should tell you after dinner.

1265
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,164
Why?

1266
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:24,630
What do you know Michael?

1267
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:35,534
<i>Ahhhhh!</i>

1268
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:40,877
And uh, then he broke up
with me... in the shower.

1269
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:46,086
Steve was
the go-go dancer!

1270
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,485
Excuse me, this is
a private meeting.

1271
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:49,147
Silence, sober one!

1272
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:50,690
What go-go dancer.

1273
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,259
From Danceateria!

1274
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,487
The Hershey squirtin'
coke head!

1275
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:57,963
Excuse me, you are
challenging our serenity.

1276
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:58,998
Shut up!

1277
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:00,534
Wait, from the 80's?

1278
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:03,134
Willy Wonka?

1279
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,800
Oh, my God.

1280
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,004
Oh, my God.

1281
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:12,874
Adam! Steve loves you, he just
can't get past his humiliation...

1282
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:15,506
over the diarrhea thing
and for turning you into...

1283
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:17,278
some gay John Belushi.

1284
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:19,512
That's why he broke up with you!

1285
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,179
But that is crazy.

1286
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:24,281
God, you're right, he is
totally unaware for a shrink.

1287
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:26,952
I'm telling you, they're
like preacher's kids.

1288
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:29,553
Cross talking is not allowed.

1289
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:30,926
Mary, please!

1290
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,829
He's so confused.

1291
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:36,335
No, he's just an
asshole and a baby.

1292
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,929
He's a baby who's
also an asshole.

1293
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:42,443
- Where are you going?
- Ah!

1294
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:52,385
Adam, if you imagine it,
you can achieve it.

1295
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:55,320
If you dream it,
you could become it.

1296
01:19:55,423 --> 01:20:01,692
<i>They said the good
ones are always taken.</i>

1297
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:06,894
<i>But I know that
that's not true.</i>

1298
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:12,907
<i>Cause if the good
ones are always taken,</i>

1299
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:19,106
<i>then how, oh how
did I find you?</i>

1300
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:39,861
<i>Well...</i>

1301
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:43,699
<i>you're walking down the
street happy as a pig in mud.</i>

1302
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:46,404
<i>Feeling simple and sweet...</i>

1303
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,635
<i>like a heifer
chewing her cud.</i>

1304
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,306
<i>Now I don't want
to burst your bubble...</i>

1305
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:54,143
<i>and make you fret.</i>

1306
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:59,208
<i>But I think that I smell
trouble so watch your step.</i>

1307
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:05,650
<i>If you're raring to go and
hopping back in the saddle.</i>

1308
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:10,922
<i>Next thing you know up a
creek without a paddle.</i>

1309
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:16,363
<i>If you think you want success
and all its trappings.</i>

1310
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:21,201
<i>But honey, life's
a mess, shit happens.</i>

1311
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:32,077
<i>They say that a life is
just a bowl of cherries.</i>

1312
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:34,420
<i>But they don't make
greeting cards...</i>

1313
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:37,355
<i>about dingleberries.</i>

1314
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:42,962
<i>Now you're embarrassed and
you won't let no one see you,</i>

1315
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:48,269
<i>'cause they don't write
love songs about diarrhea.</i>

1316
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:51,532
<i>You've got a foot in
tomorrow and foot in yesterday.</i>

1317
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,165
Not bad for a Dazzle Dancer.

1318
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:55,800
<i>You'll get
nothing but sorrow...</i>

1319
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:59,347
<i>cause you're
crapping on today.</i>

1320
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:04,179
<i>No matter what, you got
to keep on laughing.</i>

1321
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:09,386
<i>Just laugh with your mouth
shut, cause shit happens.</i>

1322
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:39,717
<i>You doing in it and you're
barefoot stepping in it.</i>

1323
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:41,152
<i>Thinking got
a master plan,</i>

1324
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:42,518
<i>then it all
just hits the fan.</i>

1325
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:43,750
<i>Life can throw
you for a loop.</i>

1326
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:45,052
<i>Then it covers
you in poop.</i>

1327
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,856
<i>Shit happens.
Shit happens.</i>

1328
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:49,123
<i>You ain't listening to me,</i>

1329
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:52,165
<i>then my gums
are just flapping.</i>

1330
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:57,828
<i>The moral of this
story, shit happens.</i>

1331
01:22:58,873 --> 01:22:59,805
<i>What?</i>

1332
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,004
<i>Shit!</i>

1333
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:02,340
<i>Huh?</i>

1334
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:04,006
<i>Shit!</i>

1335
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:05,306
<i>Can't hear you.</i>

1336
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:06,539
<i>Shit!</i>

1337
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,946
<i>Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit!</i>

1338
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:12,142
<i>Life's a game and you can win it
even when you're knee deep in it.</i>

1339
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:16,149
<i>Keep a fighting
and scrappin'...</i>

1340
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:17,622
<i>cause its spraying
and splattin'...</i>

1341
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:19,990
<i>shit happens.</i>

1342
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,625
Yeah!

1343
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,720
<i>Adam, Adam, wait up.</i>

1344
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:53,123
Adam, I'm sorry okay.

1345
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:54,286
I have nothing to say to you.

1346
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:57,661
Look, I felt like I created this
cocaine monster and unleashed

1347
01:23:57,766 --> 01:24:00,326
him onto the gay community
to wreak havoc on midgets.

1348
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:03,563
Adam, look... I gave you
your first bump of coke.

1349
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:04,330
I...

1350
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:08,534
I became incontinent
in front of you.

1351
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:10,110
Became incontinent?

1352
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,008
God, you are
such an old lady.

1353
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:13,637
<i>You're just embarrassed.</i>

1354
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,046
Yes, all right, yes I am.

1355
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:19,317
I'd be happy to course through
life having a lover who thought...

1356
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:21,082
I never went to
the bathroom at all.

1357
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,986
Who thought that some
little dove just came...

1358
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,150
and swept it all away
when I wasn't looking.

1359
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:26,950
Wait.

1360
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,723
What!
What do you want?

1361
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:30,798
I don't know, okay?

1362
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,367
I don't want some open
relationship like...

1363
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:34,435
all the gay couples I know.

1364
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:38,336
I don't want some, some gay version
of the straight couples I see!

1365
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:41,633
I don't see
what I want anywhere.

1366
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,045
Then just see me.

1367
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:52,552
You know we're just us,
we're not gay or straight...

1368
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:55,145
or Julia or Meg,
we're just two people...

1369
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:58,615
Adam and Steve.

1370
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:03,297
Maybe we should just accept
the fact that neither of those...

1371
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:05,423
people are
relationship material.

1372
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:10,361
That... they're both too damaged.

1373
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:13,635
We're in our thirties,
of course we're damaged.

1374
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:17,309
And you know what?
I am tired.

1375
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:20,677
I am tired of fighting you
and the whole world just so...

1376
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,807
I could have something
as radical and subversive...

1377
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:24,680
as a fucking boyfriend.

1378
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:27,352
Fuck you, Steve!

1379
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:31,051
I may be damaged goods but
I am goods nonetheless.

1380
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:50,210
It's not my fault!

1381
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:53,246
You wouldn't understand, she's
a woman, they have their ways!

1382
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:55,612
What, she hypnotized you
with her feminine wiles?

1383
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:59,050
Yes, yes, yes she
did, she did actually!

1384
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:05,757
What?

1385
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:07,293
What was I supposed
to do, Michael?

1386
01:26:08,696 --> 01:26:11,392
Every time he went to an
AA meeting, I'd feel guilty.

1387
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:14,832
Every time I used the
bathroom he'd stare at me...

1388
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:16,494
with a knowing look on his face.

1389
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:17,832
Get over yourself!

1390
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:19,600
The guy saw you take a dump.

1391
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:22,938
You'd eventually start changing
each other's diapers anyway.

1392
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:26,536
No, no, this is not how
it's supposed to be.

1393
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:29,310
You've got to stop with
that preconceived bullshit.

1394
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:31,612
You guys love each
other, don't you?

1395
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,710
I don't even know what
that means anymore.

1396
01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:57,868
<i>Fags!</i>

1397
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:04,882
<i>God made Adam and Eve,
not Adam and Steve!</i>

1398
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:11,748
Where, are you go...

1399
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:17,453
There you go, guys.

1400
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:23,737
I've got to go get limes
honey, I'll be right back.

1401
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:29,400
<i>You don't get much-a nothing
unless you give it a try.</i>

1402
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,673
<i>Rock the world a little, get
the thunder clapping.</i>

1403
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:36,238
<i>March yourself over there
and make things happen.</i>

1404
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:39,081
<i>Give yourself a
gift you can use.</i>

1405
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:42,088
<i>What the hell have
you got to lose?</i>

1406
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:47,059
<i>We're really all just
walking in each other's shoes.</i>

1407
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:53,862
<i>Step one; look.
Two; smile.</i>

1408
01:27:53,968 --> 01:28:00,032
<i>Three; say 'Hi'.</i>

1409
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:02,075
<i>Say 'Hi'!</i>

1410
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:09,909
Hi.

1411
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:11,543
Hi.

1412
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:15,419
This is Charlie, he uh...

1413
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:17,491
he lives across
the street from me.

1414
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:18,524
Hi.

1415
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:20,121
Hi.

1416
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:22,261
Go ahead.

1417
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:23,227
Ask him.

1418
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:25,255
Ask him.

1419
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:26,162
What's your name?

1420
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:29,029
Adam.

1421
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:31,299
What's mine?

1422
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:32,100
Steve.

1423
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:34,299
That's right Steve,
Adam and Steve.

1424
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:36,741
So see you were wrong.

1425
01:28:36,844 --> 01:28:40,974
God did make Adam and
Steve because here we are.

1426
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:43,209
Tell him, huh, tell him.

1427
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,013
Steve is sorry for the
way he treated you,

1428
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:46,711
he's sorry about everything.

1429
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,481
Well, I accept his apology.

1430
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:52,418
And...

1431
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:55,186
I'm sorry
I yelled at you,

1432
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:57,196
called you cornholers
in front of his parents.

1433
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:00,733
Okay.

1434
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:03,360
What else, what else!

1435
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,496
He wants to ask you
for your hand...

1436
01:29:05,606 --> 01:29:07,039
in one of them
gay marriages.

1437
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:13,380
A man marrying a man,
that's kind of gross.

1438
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:14,812
I know.

1439
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:20,379
Well you tell him that
personally I don't really...

1440
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:23,616
believe in marriage
and I don't really know...

1441
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:25,488
if I really believe
in him anymore.

1442
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:30,828
Whoa, that's harsh!

1443
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:41,568
Adam, please.

1444
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:46,437
I can't.

1445
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:48,412
Adam.

1446
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:53,647
I choose you, I choose you.

1447
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:57,985
I don't know why you would.

1448
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:11,498
<i>Perhaps I had
a wicked childhood.</i>

1449
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:18,403
<i>Perhaps I
had a miserable youth.</i>

1450
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:27,283
<i>But somewhere in my wicked,
miserable past,</i>

1451
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:34,954
<i>there must have been
a moment of truth.</i>

1452
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:43,794
<i>For here you are,
standing there, loving me.</i>

1453
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:49,804
<i>Whether or
not you should.</i>

1454
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:59,519
<i>So somewhere in my youth,
or childhood.</i>

1455
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:08,925
<i>I must have
done something good.</i>

1456
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:19,630
<i>Nothing comes from nothing,
nothing ever could.</i>

1457
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:29,748
<i>So somewhere in
my youth or childhood,</i>

1458
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:42,127
<i>I must have
done something good.</i>

1459
01:32:14,395 --> 01:32:16,659
Beloved family and
friends at this time...

1460
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:19,631
in the wedding
we do the ring ceremony.

1461
01:32:19,734 --> 01:32:23,830
Rhonda if you would give
me Adam's ring for Steve.

1462
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:25,064
Thank you.

1463
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:28,903
Michael if you would give
me Steve's ring for Adam.

1464
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:31,069
Thank you.

1465
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:32,543
Hold hands.

1466
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:37,315
Father Mother God we ask
just now for your blessing...

1467
01:32:37,418 --> 01:32:39,352
on these beautiful
wedding rings...

1468
01:32:39,453 --> 01:32:42,388
that they may symbolize
for Adam and Steve...

1469
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:45,857
in their union health and
happiness, strength and courage,

1470
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,520
joy and peace, abundance
and prosperity,

1471
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:51,530
and unconditional
loving for each other.

1472
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:52,860
So be it.

1473
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:56,459
Adam if you would place this
ring on Steven's hand...

1474
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,436
and repeat after me.

1475
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:01,201
Steve, with this
ring I thee wed.

1476
01:33:04,345 --> 01:33:07,246
Steve, with this
ring I thee wed.

1477
01:33:07,348 --> 01:33:11,114
Steve, if you would place
this ring on Adam's hand...

1478
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:13,118
and repeat after me.

1479
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,916
Adam, with this ring I thee wed.

1480
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:19,723
Adam, with this ring I thee wed.

1481
01:33:19,827 --> 01:33:25,732
Do you Adam Bernstein
take Steve Hicks...

1482
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:28,666
to be your beloved husband?

1483
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:31,063
I do.

1484
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:35,801
Steve Hicks, do you
take Adam Bernstein...

1485
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:38,071
to be your beloved husband?

1486
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:39,976
You bet your ass I do.

1487
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:44,541
And now by the power vested
in me by the state of New York,

1488
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:48,782
I now pronounce you
husband and husband.

1489
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:50,618
You may kiss your beloved.

1490
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:59,390
And now Adam in the
tradition of your family,

1491
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:00,762
we'll break the glass.

1492
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:06,970
Mazoltov!

1493
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:45,037
<i>Love is real.</i>

1494
01:34:48,282 --> 01:34:50,876
<i>Real is love.</i>

1495
01:34:54,255 --> 01:34:57,122
<i>Love is feeling,</i>

1496
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:02,491
<i>#feeling love.</i>

1497
01:35:06,133 --> 01:35:09,068
<i>Love is wanting,</i>

1498
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:15,135
<i>to be loved.</i>

1499
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:20,570
<i>Love is touch.</i>

1500
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:27,184
<i>Touch is love.</i>

1501
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:32,418
<i>Love is reaching,</i>

1502
01:35:35,596 --> 01:35:38,497
<i>reaching love.</i>

1503
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:44,231
<i>Love is asking,</i>

1504
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:50,541
<i>to be loved.</i>

1505
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:06,357
<i>Well...</i>

1506
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:10,328
<i>you're walking down the
street happy as a pig in mud.</i>

1507
01:36:11,799 --> 01:36:13,096
<i>Feeling simple and sweet...</i>

1508
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,259
<i>like a heifer
chewing her cud.</i>

1509
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:18,902
<i>Now I don't want
to burst your bubble...</i>

1510
01:36:19,006 --> 01:36:20,667
<i>and make you fret.</i>

1511
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:25,803
<i>But I think that I smell
trouble so watch your step.</i>

1512
01:36:27,681 --> 01:36:31,777
<i>If you're raring to go and
hopping back in the saddle.</i>

1513
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:37,354
<i>Next thing you know up a
creek without a paddle.</i>

1514
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:42,724
<i>If you think you want success
and all its trappings.</i>

1515
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:47,757
<i>But honey, life's
a mess, shit happens.</i>

1516
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:58,571
<i>They say that a life is
just a bowl of cherries.</i>

1517
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,380
<i>But they don't make
greeting cards...</i>

1518
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,712
<i>about dingleberries.</i>

1519
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:09,282
<i>Now you're embarrassed and
you won't let no one see you,</i>

1520
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:14,723
<i>'cause they don't write
love songs about diarrhea.</i>

1521
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:20,164
<i>You've got a foot in
tomorrow and foot in yesterday.</i>

1522
01:37:21,068 --> 01:37:22,262
<i>You'll get
nothing but sorrow...</i>

1523
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:25,532
<i>cause you're
crapping on today.</i>

1524
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:30,471
<i>No matter what, you go
to keep on laughing.</i>

1525
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:35,805
<i>Just laugh with your mouth
shut, cause shit happens.</i>

1526
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:06,179
<i>You doing in it and you're
barefoot stepping in it.</i>

1527
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,577
<i>Thinking got
a master plan,</i>

1528
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:08,943
<i>then it all
just hits the fan.</i>

1529
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:10,209
<i>Life can throw
you for a loop.</i>

1530
01:38:10,317 --> 01:38:11,648
<i>Then it covers
you in poop.</i>

1531
01:38:11,752 --> 01:38:14,186
<i>Shit happens.
Shit happens.</i>

1532
01:38:14,288 --> 01:38:15,619
<i>You ain't listening to me,</i>

1533
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:18,351
<i>then my gums
are just flapping.</i>

1534
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:23,959
<i>The moral of this
story, shit happens.</i>

1535
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:25,922
<i>What?</i>

1536
01:38:26,467 --> 01:38:27,434
<i>Shit!</i>

1537
01:38:28,135 --> 01:38:28,794
<i>Huh?</i>

1538
01:38:29,336 --> 01:38:30,598
<i>Shit!</i>

1539
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:31,796
<i>Can't hear you.</i>

1540
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:33,373
<i>Shit!</i>

1541
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:35,704
<i>Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit!</i>

1542
01:38:36,176 --> 01:38:38,474
<i>Life's a game and you can win it
even when you're knee deep in it.</i>

1543
01:38:41,615 --> 01:38:42,673
<i>Keep a fighting
and scrappin'...</i>

1544
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:44,080
<i>cause its spraying
and splattin'.</i>

1545
01:38:44,184 --> 01:38:46,709
<i>Shit happens.</i>

1546
01:38:51,058 --> 01:38:52,184
<i>Shit!</i>
