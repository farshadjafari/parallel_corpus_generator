Come on, sweetie pie.

00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:13,142
Morning, Elvis.
You're a pretty Elvis, aren't you?

4
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:15,517
Yes, you are.

5
00:01:15,588 --> 00:01:18,182
Yes, you are.

6
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:21,715
Jesus Christ, Ronnie, you know
I have to fucking work tonight.

7
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:23,452
Somebody around here
has got to make some money.

8
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,657
I'm all broken up here, bitch.
I can't work.

00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:29,099
- Yeah, and whose fault is that?
- Fuck you.

10
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:31,432
Oh, my God, you're pathetic.

11
00:01:31,504 --> 00:01:33,699
You know that new waitress
over at the Bingo Lounge?

12
00:01:33,773 --> 00:01:36,003
She's been giving me the freaky eye.

13
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:38,475
Oh, the whore with the big tits
hanging down to her knees?

14
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:39,738

Good. Well, have
a good fucking time.

- I will.
- I hope she likes cripples.

That's all that fucker does is cry.

Can't you see I'm making eggs over here?

30
00:02:22,254 --> 00:02:23,721
I'll pass.

32
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:28,257
Since now. They're chicken abortions,
and they're fucking gross.

33
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:30,158
They are not chicken abortions.

34
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:31,924

You know what, can you please
go upstairs and get your brother?

00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:37,562
Why do I always have to do it?

37
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:38,830
Just do it!

a nice little dumper.

- You heard me.

No, say it again, Ronnie!
Say it to my face!

That freak of yours,
he needs some serious discipline.

I mean, he runs around like a little bitch.

57

You leave him alone.
Keep your hands off him.

58
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:32,919
Give me a fucking break.
He's probably a queer.

59

end up cutting his dick and balls off

You were there. He was like,
"I'm not gonna fight you." I was like--

Yes!

87

I heard your sister got caught
selling blow jobs in the bathroom.

Shut up.

98

and let me suck her tits?

- Shut up! Shut up!
- Don't fucking yell in my face, you bitch!

and this goddamn school?

I cannot keep coming down here like this.

Look, Miss Myers,

120
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,956
I do not enjoy calling you down here
every five minutes.

121
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:24,325
Really?
It sure seems like you fucking do.

122
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:26,489
Can't you get control
over your school, principal?

123
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:29,830
Yes, I can get control.
I can control my school.

124
00:06:29,902 --> 00:06:32,700
There's something you gotta know.

125
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,437
Will you just relax a moment?
Please sit down and let me talk to you.

126
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:43,708
- Please. Please.
- Okay. What?

127
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:45,841
Please, sit down.

128

- Thank God.
- Hi, Jim. How are you?

129
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:49,845
Is this her?

130
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,687
Miss Myers, this is Dr. Loomis.
I took the liberty of calling him in.

131
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,221
- Happens to be a child psychologist--
- Thank you, Jim.

132
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:58,593
Psychologist?

133
00:06:58,664 --> 00:06:59,995
May I ask you,

134
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:03,398
has your son ever had any kind
of serious psychiatric evaluation?

135
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:05,937
Okay, I've had enough.
This is crazy.

136
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,666
- Miss Myers, please.
- I gotta get back to work.

137
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,207
- I gotta go.
- Please, ma'am.

138
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:12,038
We only want the best for the child.
Please don't take offense.

139
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:13,703
Please, sit down. Sit down.

140
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:14,803
Thank you.

141
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,542
Look, uh, Miss Myers...

142
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:19,277
we found this...

143
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,148
in Michael's school bag.

144
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:25,556
Come on. Big deal.
He found a dead cat.

145
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:28,957
And these.

146
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:31,519
What is that?

147
00:07:31,597 --> 00:07:33,758
I hope you're not squeamish, Mrs. Myers.

148
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:37,131
Oh, God.

149
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:39,170
Oh, this is really sick.

150
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,099
Are you saying Michael did this?

151
00:07:44,643 --> 00:07:46,201
Michael loves animals. He--

152
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:50,414
Why would he do this?

153
00:07:50,482 --> 00:07:55,977
Mrs. Myers, typically the thrill of hurting
or causing pain to smaller creatures,

154
00:07:56,055 --> 00:07:58,489
it's often an early warning sign.

155
00:07:58,557 --> 00:08:00,115
Early warning sign for what?

156
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:04,956
For much deeper and bigger problems.

157
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,362
[Mrs. Myers] What do you mean problems?
What is this?

158
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:10,095
[Loomis]
He's a very disturbed young man.

159
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:14,003
I have to evaluate him,
and I'd like to interview him.

160
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:16,974
I need to take him
through a series of tests.

161
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,669
[Mrs. Myers] Well, you can talk to him,
but what does--

162
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:20,473
what does evaluating him--
what does that mean?

163
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:24,642
[Loomis] Obviously, he's a very deranged
young mind that can do this to his pets.

164
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:26,685
[Mrs. Myers]
You don't know that he did that.

165
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:32,387
Fuck, man, if I get one more fucking detention,
I'll be fucking expelled.

166
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,857
My old man's gonna beat my ass.

167
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:36,918
We gotta get that piece of shit
on the weekend so we don't get in trouble.

168
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:39,020
Dude, if I see that Myers pussy,
he's fucking dead.

169
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,969
You want it?

170
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:57,572
Huh? Do you want it?

171
00:09:37,322 --> 00:09:38,687
Aah!

172
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:40,281
Ow!

173
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:44,727
What the fuck?

174
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:47,561

538

They will destroy you.

539

These eyes do not see
what you and I see.

543
00:42:23,553 --> 00:42:28,718
Behind these eyes
one finds only blackness,

544
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:31,784

545
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:36,060

00:54:52,401 --> 00:54:53,732
Look at this, Mom. Oh!

707
00:54:53,803 --> 00:54:55,600
- Laurie, stop!
- I'm sorry. Okay.

708
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:58,231
- Are you eating?
- No, I'll get something at school.

709
00:54:58,307 --> 00:55:00,002
- Oh, my God.
- [Dad] Oh, sure.

710
00:55:00,076 --> 00:55:03,341
Just let the faceless marauding
corporate monsters of America

711
00:55:03,412 --> 00:55:05,107
destroy everything
beautiful about this town.

712
00:55:05,181 --> 00:55:08,514
Corporate monsters or not,
Epic Mart's a lot cheaper.

713
00:55:08,584 --> 00:55:10,745
Oh, man, I gotta get out of here.

714
00:55:14,657 --> 00:55:17,649
- Thanks again for dropping that thing off.
- No sweat, Dad.

715
00:55:17,727 --> 00:55:20,287
Just shove the envelope
inside the mail slot, okay?

716
00:55:20,363 --> 00:55:21,591
Yeah, Dad, I know.

717
00:55:21,664 --> 00:55:23,154
They're coming by to look at it later, honey.

718
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:24,221
- So, it's very important that--
- Dad, okay.

719
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,530
<i>I understand.
Muy importante.</i>

720
00:55:26,602 --> 00:55:27,660
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

721
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:28,829
Have a good day.

722
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:32,671
Mason, you forgot your briefcase, honey.

723
00:55:32,742 --> 00:55:34,903
- Ah, shit.
- Ah, shit.

724
00:55:34,977 --> 00:55:36,410
I feel like "What round is it?"

725
00:55:39,148 --> 00:55:40,274
Yeah.

726
00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:44,342
Oh, uh, you think you could...
glue Mr. Bones' arms on or something?

727
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,753
- Have a good day, baby.
- Yeah. Top on my priority list.

728
00:55:51,294 --> 00:55:52,283
Hey, Laurie!

729
00:55:52,361 --> 00:55:53,419
- Wait up!
- Oh, God.

730
00:55:53,496 --> 00:55:56,397
- Leave me alone, Tommy.
- Wait.

731
00:55:56,465 --> 00:55:59,434
Definition: Stop walking.

732
00:55:59,502 --> 00:56:02,869
- Can I ask you something serious?
- Sure, why not?

733
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:05,305
Did you ever hear
about the Mexican Wolf Man?

734
00:56:05,374 --> 00:56:07,433
- No.
- Yeah, well, he's real.

735
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:09,034
- I saw him on TV last night...
- Yeah.

736
00:56:09,111 --> 00:56:12,877
And his name's Danny, and his face
is completely covered with hair.

737
00:56:12,949 --> 00:56:14,644
And he likes soccer.
I swear it! They showed--

738
00:56:14,717 --> 00:56:15,775
- Okay.
- He's a wolf!

739
00:56:15,851 --> 00:56:18,115
Tommy, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

740
00:56:18,187 --> 00:56:19,552
Lay off the candy corn, kid.

741
00:56:19,622 --> 00:56:22,147
Stop acting like I'm crazy. It's true!

742
00:56:22,224 --> 00:56:24,249
Tommy, I'm your babysitter.
You're crazy.

743
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:26,818
- I know this. You're crazy.
- Ooohhh!

744
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:55,112
[Laurie]
All right, gotta make a stop here.

745
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:58,381
[Tommy]
Whoa! What are you, insane?

746
00:57:58,454 --> 00:58:00,888
Oh, my gosh, Tommy,
I'm not even listening to you.

747
00:58:00,956 --> 00:58:02,981
You'd better listen to me.

748
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:04,253
He's right there.

749
00:58:04,326 --> 00:58:06,419
What are you, crazy?
You can't go in there.

750
00:58:06,495 --> 00:58:08,190
Oh, yes, I can.

751
00:58:08,264 --> 00:58:10,494
Hold my books, please?

752
00:58:11,934 --> 00:58:14,494
That's the devil's house.
The Boogey Man lives in there.

753
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:16,629
Yeah.
Oh, no, Tommy.

754
00:58:16,706 --> 00:58:18,799
Don't even joke about it.
I'm serious.

755
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:20,967
Oh, you're scaring me.

756
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:24,274
The Boogey Man will get me
or Danny the Wolf Man.

757
00:58:30,786 --> 00:58:32,413
Oh, no, Tommy.

758
00:58:32,488 --> 00:58:35,252
Oh, no!

759
00:58:35,324 --> 00:58:36,951
Oh, no, it's pulling me--

760
00:58:37,026 --> 00:58:39,517
Oh, no, Tommy, it's pulling me in!

761
00:58:39,595 --> 00:58:41,529
Ha ha ha.

762
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:43,698
It was just a joke. Chill.

763
00:58:43,766 --> 00:58:45,666
I wish it wasn't.

764
00:58:45,735 --> 00:58:47,566
Come on, hurry up.

765
00:58:47,636 --> 00:58:49,831
Chill, spazz-monkey.

766
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:51,099
Thanks.

767
00:58:54,176 --> 00:58:56,144
That's no place to screw around,
Laurie.

768
00:58:56,212 --> 00:58:58,737
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

769
00:58:58,814 --> 00:59:00,975
Do you know whose house that is?

770
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,347
Come on.

771
00:59:02,418 --> 00:59:04,511
- It's going to be fine.
- Yeah.

772
00:59:04,587 --> 00:59:06,020
What if something happens?

773
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:08,852
- Laurie, what is going to happen?
- I don't know.

774
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:10,585
It's going to be fine.

775
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:12,889
What is going to be fine?

776
00:59:12,962 --> 00:59:16,295
Annie wants me to pretend
to baby-sit Lindsey Wallace,

777
00:59:16,365 --> 00:59:19,926
then sneak out and dump her with me
so she can go and see Paul.

778
00:59:20,002 --> 00:59:21,367
Sounds like
one of my crafty ideas.

779
00:59:21,437 --> 00:59:22,665
- Yeah.
- I like it.

780
00:59:22,738 --> 00:59:25,605
Anyway, I thought Paul was, like, grounded
for trashing his dad's motorcycle.

781
00:59:25,674 --> 00:59:27,665
Oh, yeah.
No, he was, but he got out of it.

782
00:59:27,743 --> 00:59:29,005
- You know.
- Yeah.

783
00:59:29,078 --> 00:59:31,342
Please?

784
00:59:31,413 --> 00:59:32,778
What if they come home early?

785
00:59:32,848 --> 00:59:35,510
Dude, they are not
going to come home early.

786
00:59:35,584 --> 00:59:37,381
Okay? Mrs. Wallace is a lush.

787
00:59:37,453 --> 00:59:40,445
They're going to be out all night
getting hammered.

788
00:59:40,523 --> 00:59:43,390
Yeah. Annie, I really hate lying.
You know that.

789
00:59:43,459 --> 00:59:46,019
God, what are you, Mother Teresa?

790
00:59:46,095 --> 00:59:47,426
- No.
- Yes, she is.

791
00:59:47,496 --> 00:59:49,123
Look at her.
She's like a little angel.

792
00:59:49,198 --> 00:59:53,032
- She's Mother-fucking Teresa.
- Stop. I am not!

793
00:59:53,102 --> 00:59:54,592
Please?

794
00:59:57,373 --> 00:59:59,307
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes!

795
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:00,569
You owe me big time.

796
01:00:00,643 --> 01:00:02,577
- I love you.
- I love you.

797
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,680
Did you know that ethyl alcohol
boils at 78.5 degrees Celsius?

798
01:00:08,751 --> 01:00:10,218
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

799
01:00:10,286 --> 01:00:11,753
That's pretty cool, right?

800
01:00:12,755 --> 01:00:13,847
Call me back.

801
01:00:17,259 --> 01:00:19,090
This is all your fault.

802
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:20,992
I mean, you're responsible.

803
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:27,459
I cannot be responsible
for everything that goes on in here.

804
01:00:27,536 --> 01:00:29,003
- What about you?
- No, no, no, no.

805
01:00:29,071 --> 01:00:31,039
You're not pinning this on me.

806
01:00:31,106 --> 01:00:34,803
- He was your patient, Doctor.
- Was my patient.

807
01:00:34,877 --> 01:00:38,335
Look, all you guys had to do
was to play zoo-keeper.

808
01:00:38,414 --> 01:00:41,872
Just keep the monkeyhouse locked
until the monkey died of old age.

809
01:00:41,951 --> 01:00:43,418
How difficult is that?

810
01:00:43,485 --> 01:00:47,319
Christ, you can barely tell
he's breathing half the time.

811
01:00:47,389 --> 01:00:51,189
He's been like a comatose kitty
for 15 years.

812
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:54,093
If our security wasn't sufficient, Sammy,

813
01:00:54,163 --> 01:00:55,960
you should have warned us.

814
01:00:56,031 --> 01:01:00,297
I see. So you're just going
to wash your hands of the whole thing.

815
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:03,202
You know, you two make me sick.

816
01:01:11,347 --> 01:01:15,681
"He is mad that trusts
in the tameness of a wolf."

817
01:01:17,386 --> 01:01:20,014
We've given the authorities
his complete profile.

818
01:01:20,089 --> 01:01:23,581
Two road blocks and an all-points bulletin
wouldn't stop a 5-year-old.

819
01:01:23,659 --> 01:01:25,320
Well, what do you want us to do?

820
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:27,385
Yes. I mean,
what do you want us to do?

821
01:01:28,864 --> 01:01:30,832
I want you to get on the phone,

822
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,597
and I want you to tell them
who broke out of here last night.

823
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:38,128
And I want you to tell them
exactly where he's going.

824
01:01:38,207 --> 01:01:39,674
Christ, we don't know where he's going.

825
01:01:39,742 --> 01:01:41,835
It must be great living in denial.

826
01:01:41,911 --> 01:01:43,503
I must try it sometime.

827
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:47,276
Look, you and that army
of shirt-tuckers up there,

828
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:49,317
you know damn well where he's going.

829
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:52,110
And where is that?

830
01:01:55,491 --> 01:01:57,322
Haddonfield!

831
01:01:57,393 --> 01:02:00,157
Haddonfield's a hundred miles
away from here.

832
01:02:00,229 --> 01:02:01,355
[School bell rings]

833
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,692
This is so fucked.

834
01:02:02,765 --> 01:02:04,892
What, me suspended from the squad?

835
01:02:04,967 --> 01:02:06,161
I don't mean to sound conceited,

836
01:02:06,235 --> 01:02:08,396
but I'm, like, the fucking hottest
cheerleader they've got.

837
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,199
Yeah, Lynda,
that doesn't sound conceited.

838
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:12,172
What, so now nobody
can take a joke anymore?

839
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:13,868
- What did you say?
- Check it.

840
01:02:13,943 --> 01:02:16,537
So Lady Fuck-face gives us
three new cheers to learn,

841
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:20,571
so I'm like, "Hey, why don't we just
rock it commando, flash some snatch?

842
01:02:20,649 --> 01:02:22,708
And maybe nobody will notice
we're doing the same old tired cheers."

843
01:02:22,785 --> 01:02:24,719
- Oh, you didn't.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

844
01:02:24,787 --> 01:02:25,776
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

845
01:02:25,854 --> 01:02:27,549
You know what that
dried-up fucking bitch did?

846
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:30,319
- What?
- Calls my dad and tells him what I said.

847
01:02:30,392 --> 01:02:31,381
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

848
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,691
That C-U-N-T, yeah,
needs to get laid.

849
01:02:34,763 --> 01:02:36,390
What did your dad say?

850
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:37,693
Oh, who cares?

851
01:02:37,766 --> 01:02:41,532
I'll just give him the little sweetie-pants
princess suck-up routine.

852
01:02:41,603 --> 01:02:44,834
Daddy's little pookie would never
say something like that.

853
01:02:44,907 --> 01:02:46,670
Gosh, ever since your parents split up,

854
01:02:46,742 --> 01:02:48,801
you have your dad
wrapped around your little finger.

855
01:02:48,877 --> 01:02:51,107
Totally wrapped.

856
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,705
- Hey, bitches!
- Hey, Annie.

857
01:02:53,782 --> 01:02:57,445
- Thanks for waiting for me.
- Whatever. Hurry your ass up.

858
01:02:57,519 --> 01:02:59,248
God.

859
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:02,552
Hey, I heard about your
little cheerleading incident.

860
01:03:02,624 --> 01:03:04,854
Yeah, I'm totally famous.

861
01:03:04,927 --> 01:03:06,554
You're totally a slut.

862
01:03:06,628 --> 01:03:08,152
Yeah.
[Laughs]

863
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:10,061
Anyway, today in class,
in French class,

864
01:03:10,132 --> 01:03:12,100
Mr. Leclerc was totally
flirting with me.

865
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:16,069
- God, here we go!
- We were conjugating the verb "to want."

866
01:03:16,138 --> 01:03:19,904
<i>- Because he so wants you!
- Je veuxl Je veuxl</i>

867
01:03:19,975 --> 01:03:22,773
- Oh, my gosh.
- Bare Leclerc.

868
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:24,472
Bare Leclerc wants me.

869
01:03:24,546 --> 01:03:26,446
I think that guy's watching us.

870
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:28,176
- What guy?
- That guy over there.

871
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,342
Yeah?

872
01:03:29,418 --> 01:03:31,215
- Oh, please.
- I saw him outside school earlier.

873
01:03:31,286 --> 01:03:33,311
Probably just some pervert

- Total pervert.
- Gosh, you guys are crazy.

884
01:03:53,842 --> 01:03:55,104
That guy could have been dangerous.

885
01:03:55,177 --> 01:03:56,405

- Whatever.

886
01:03:56,478 --> 01:03:58,275

- Kind of a drag having a pig as a dad.
- Nah, I like him.

904
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:38,219
Yeah? Do you think
he was flirting with me?

905
01:04:38,287 --> 01:04:40,118

Would you please help me
with this stupid thing?

Okay, okay, okay.

911
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:35,902
Jeez. Mom, why do you
deal with this every year?

912
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:38,037
Because for some unbelievable reason,

913
01:05:38,113 --> 01:05:40,877
your father likes it.

914
01:05:40,949 --> 01:05:42,974
- The feet look like the hands--
- It's not working.

915
01:05:43,051 --> 01:05:46,248
And the hands like the feet,
and I can't get the thing in the hole, and--

916
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:49,347
- Oh, I can't get it!
- Calm down, I'm helping--

917

- Will you try and get those right?

919
01:05:53,896 --> 01:05:55,363
Okay, I'll try.

920
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,590
Oh, jeez.

921
01:05:56,665 --> 01:05:59,828
I've been out here
for two hours doing this.

922
01:05:59,902 --> 01:06:01,870
There.

923

- Just hang himself. No!

924
01:06:04,473 --> 01:06:07,203
I'm still upset about the whole
bagel thing this morning,

925
01:06:07,276 --> 01:06:08,265
if you want to know the truth.

926
01:06:08,343 --> 01:06:09,503
Mom, that was a joke.

927
01:06:09,578 --> 01:06:10,943
- Oh, yeah. Well, let me tell you.
- It was a joke.

928
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:12,878
There are some things
moms don't need to hear.

929
01:06:12,948 --> 01:06:14,540
- Yeah, I'm 17.

Yeah. Hello? He--

Oh, sh-- ugh!
Can I borrow your cell phone?

936
01:06:39,141 --> 01:06:41,701
This thing's about as useful
as a row of Christmas puddings.

Oh, no. I don't have one.

Oh, yeah. Right.

940
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:50,716
You know, I remember this mess
just like it happened yesterday?

941
01:06:50,786 --> 01:06:52,151
It was tragic.

942
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:54,018
The poor woman,
I guess she couldn't stand the stress

943
01:06:54,089 --> 01:06:57,024
of being labeled "Satan's mother."

944
01:06:57,092 --> 01:06:59,526
I think she blew her fucking head off.

945
01:06:59,595 --> 01:07:01,426
I'm still amazed.

I think he wrote a book or something.

Fucking blood money.

949
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:12,335
Yeah, I read that book.
It was a masterpiece.

Jesus Christ!

953
01:07:21,683 --> 01:07:25,278
Don't they think I have anything better to do
with my time than clean up this shit?

954
01:07:25,354 --> 01:07:27,345
Fucking little idiots! God damn it!

955
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:29,083
Where the hell are you going?

Maybe I can buy it.

Yeah, with like, your $10 you have
in your piggy bank?

962

It's a shithole anyway.

We'll find another house to party in.

Besides, I'm gonna
get the van all jacked up.

All right, I'll go.

983
01:09:33,148 --> 01:09:37,778
So, seriously, on a scale from 1 to 10,
should I have a 5?

984
01:09:37,853 --> 01:09:42,256
How about... zero?

985
01:09:42,324 --> 01:09:43,484
- More like--
- Zero.

986
01:09:43,558 --> 01:09:44,786

"cheerleading incident."

I cannot believe you're graduating this year.

1044
01:14:26,608 --> 01:14:29,338
I remember when you used
to run around looking like that.

1045
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:31,345
Mom, I was never a princess.

1046
01:14:31,413 --> 01:14:33,677
Last thing I was at their age
was dead Little Red Riding Hood.

1047
01:14:33,748 --> 01:14:35,045
You were this beautiful ballerina--

1048
01:14:35,116 --> 01:14:37,880
No, you bought me the blood
and you gave me the cuts.

1049
01:14:37,952 --> 01:14:39,317
"My costume's too tight."

1050
01:14:39,387 --> 01:14:40,979
- You don't remember that?
- I never wore a tutu.

1051
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:42,785
You getting many kids?

1052
01:14:42,857 --> 01:14:45,724
Only two so far.

1053
01:14:45,794 --> 01:14:48,228
Listen...

1054
01:14:48,296 --> 01:14:49,285
be careful tonight.

1055
01:14:49,364 --> 01:14:50,353
I know.

1056
01:14:50,432 --> 01:14:52,832
A lot of nut cases come out on Halloween.

1057
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:56,098
It's, uh--
What was it you told me to say?

1058
01:14:57,572 --> 01:15:00,234
- Amateur night.
- Yeah, that's right. Amateur night.

1059
01:15:00,308 --> 01:15:02,435
Dad, I'm just going to be babysitting.

1060
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:04,102
- What's the worst thing I could do?
- All right, okay.

1061
01:15:04,179 --> 01:15:05,874
- I'm just saying.
- Nice.

1062
01:15:05,947 --> 01:15:06,971
- All right.
- Sorry.

1063
01:15:07,048 --> 01:15:08,606
- Aah!
- Mom, st--

1064
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:14,616
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Strode!

1065
01:15:14,689 --> 01:15:15,815
- Hey, Annie.
- Hey.

1066
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:16,948
How's your dad?

1067
01:15:17,025 --> 01:15:19,619
Oh, you know, same as always.

1068
01:15:19,694 --> 01:15:21,889
- You know what that means?
- Mm-hmm.

1069
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:25,032
Yeah. Love you guys!

1070
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:27,432
- Love you, too!
- Bye-bye!

1071
01:15:27,502 --> 01:15:28,764
Gonna give me some lovin'?

1072
01:15:28,837 --> 01:15:33,137
I'll give you some lovin' later, but first
you're going to talk about the vacation.

1073
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:36,575
I'm going to go build a fire.

1074
01:15:36,644 --> 01:15:38,339
Vacation.

1075
01:15:38,413 --> 01:15:40,881
I hate vacation. Let's stay home.

1076
01:16:13,248 --> 01:16:14,545
Aaahhh!

1077
01:16:41,509 --> 01:16:43,500
No! No!

1078
01:16:43,578 --> 01:16:46,843
You leave my baby alone, you--

1079
01:17:00,261 --> 01:17:01,956
[crack]

1080
01:17:06,935 --> 01:17:09,403
Okay, Tommy,
here's your jelly sandwich,

1081
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:11,495
hold the peanut butter.

1082
01:17:11,573 --> 01:17:12,801
Good.

1083
01:17:12,874 --> 01:17:14,774
You know, if you listened to me
the first time,

1084
01:17:14,843 --> 01:17:16,333
you wouldn't had to have made it twice.

1085
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:22,049
- Laurie?
- What?

1086
01:17:22,817 --> 01:17:24,751
Is the Boogey Man real?

1087
01:17:24,819 --> 01:17:27,117
Why are you so obsessed
with the Boogey Man, Tommy?

1088
01:17:27,188 --> 01:17:30,487
- Well, I hear things at school.
- Like what?

1089
01:17:30,558 --> 01:17:33,288
Well, I heard that on Halloween night,

1090
01:17:33,361 --> 01:17:36,819
the Boogey Man sneaks out
and attacks kids who don't believe.

1091
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,691
You know what, Tommy?

1092
01:17:40,768 --> 01:17:42,736
It is true.

1093
01:17:42,804 --> 01:17:45,466
He likes to eat little boys like you.

1094
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:49,134
Oh, my God!
The Boogey Man's here!

1095
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:50,905
We're going to die!

1096
01:17:50,979 --> 01:17:52,310
[Telephone rings]

1097
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,938
Hold that thought.

1098
01:17:54,015 --> 01:17:56,210
That's not appropriate
babysitter behavior, Laurie.

1099
01:17:56,284 --> 01:17:57,512
Hello?

1100
01:17:58,219 --> 01:17:59,652
<i>[Laurie]
Shut up.</i>

1101
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:02,554
<i>- My parents will hear about this one.
- Yo, it's me. Hey.</i>

1102
01:18:02,624 --> 01:18:04,922
So the Wallaces are finally out of my face.

1103
01:18:04,993 --> 01:18:06,585
I just talked to Paul.
He's on his way over.

1104
01:18:06,661 --> 01:18:12,156
So I'm finishing making the Queen of Sheba
her popcorn, and then I will be over.

1105
01:18:12,233 --> 01:18:15,361
I have some fun and exciting news for you,
so I'll see you in a few minutes.

1106
01:18:15,436 --> 01:18:16,869
Okay, bye.

1107
01:18:18,606 --> 01:18:20,938
- Guess what, Tommy.
- What?

1108
01:18:21,009 --> 01:18:23,500
Lindsey Wallace is coming over.

1109
01:18:23,578 --> 01:18:25,603
What? She can't come over here!

1110
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,478
- What if the guys see her?
- So?

1111
01:18:28,549 --> 01:18:30,016
One, she's a girl.

1112
01:18:30,084 --> 01:18:32,211
Two, she's not a boy.

1113
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:33,948
And three, she smells like you.

1114
01:18:34,022 --> 01:18:37,423
This is going to be a long night.

1115
01:18:37,492 --> 01:18:38,823
For the both of us.

1116
01:18:39,827 --> 01:18:40,816
- Don't start with me.
- Uh, uh.

1117
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,920
What's the matter with you?

1118
01:19:09,557 --> 01:19:12,355
Lindsey... get your coat on.

1119
01:19:12,427 --> 01:19:14,361
We're going to go over
and see Tommy Doyal.

1120
01:19:14,429 --> 01:19:16,192
Okay.

1121
01:19:23,671 --> 01:19:26,606
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1122
01:19:26,674 --> 01:19:29,006
Yeah, exactly.
I said get your coat on.

1123
01:19:29,077 --> 01:19:33,138
We're going over to your late-night lover
Tommy Doyal's house.

1124
01:19:33,214 --> 01:19:34,340
No, you didn't.

1125
01:19:34,415 --> 01:19:35,677
Yes, I did.

1126
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:37,741
No, you didn't.

1127
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:42,256
Don, I'm sorry if I don't
sound too concerned,

1128
01:19:42,323 --> 01:19:46,419
but a dead coyote and a missing headstone
doesn't prove anything.

1129
01:19:46,494 --> 01:19:47,518
Well, I think you're wrong, Sheriff.

1130
01:19:47,595 --> 01:19:50,291
I think it does prove
that he's here in Haddonfield.

1131
01:19:50,365 --> 01:19:52,925
It was a Halloween prank.

1132
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:55,299
Kids pull shit like that all the time.

1133
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:56,894
The stone will be returned tomorrow.

1134
01:19:56,971 --> 01:19:59,030
And besides, it weighs over half a ton.

1135
01:19:59,107 --> 01:20:01,575
That's my point exactly.

1136
01:20:01,642 --> 01:20:05,578
So you're saying that one man picked it up
and walked away with it?

1137
01:20:05,646 --> 01:20:06,772
Yes.

1138
01:20:06,848 --> 01:20:09,544
Doc, I may have been born,
but I wasn't born yesterday.

1139
01:20:09,617 --> 01:20:12,882
I'm sorry, Sheriff,
but please listen to me.

1140
01:20:12,954 --> 01:20:15,184
This may be a matter of life and death.

1141
01:20:15,256 --> 01:20:18,384
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1142
01:20:18,459 --> 01:20:20,256
You come by my office tomorrow--

1143
01:20:20,328 --> 01:20:22,762
Tomorrow is too late.

1144
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:25,094
Evil is here.

1145
01:20:25,166 --> 01:20:26,997
It's walking amongst us.

1146
01:20:27,068 --> 01:20:30,060
Doc, it sounds to me like
you're talking about the Antichrist.

1147
01:20:30,138 --> 01:20:32,698
Well, perhaps I am.

1148
01:20:32,774 --> 01:20:33,763
Smell my feet

1149
01:20:33,841 --> 01:20:35,502
Give me something good to eat

1150
01:20:35,576 --> 01:20:37,373
If you don't, I don't care

1151
01:20:37,445 --> 01:20:39,379
I'll pull down Annie's underwear

1152
01:20:39,447 --> 01:20:42,575
I can't believe you're making me
haul this thing all the way over there.

1153
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:46,086
I can't believe you think
I'm not going to tell.

1154
01:20:47,188 --> 01:20:50,021
Gonna share some popcorn
with your little boyfriend?

1155
01:20:50,091 --> 01:20:51,956
No, I'm not.

1156
01:20:52,026 --> 01:20:53,550
You know you are.

1157
01:20:53,628 --> 01:20:56,290
You know you're going
to share something with Paul.

1158
01:20:56,364 --> 01:20:58,559
You know how annoying you are?

1159
01:20:58,633 --> 01:21:00,498
How?

1160
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:02,627
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

1161
01:21:02,703 --> 01:21:04,432
Give me something good to eat

1162
01:21:04,505 --> 01:21:07,497
- If you don't, I don't care--
- I swear to God, Lindsey.

1163
01:21:07,575 --> 01:21:09,065
If you don't stop singing that song,

1164
01:21:09,143 --> 01:21:10,974
we're going to have
a pumpkin-smashing party

1165
01:21:11,045 --> 01:21:12,774
right here in the middle of the street.

1166
01:21:12,847 --> 01:21:14,747
[Doorbell rings]

1167
01:21:21,622 --> 01:21:23,852
Tommy, where's your girlfriend Laurie?

1168
01:21:23,925 --> 01:21:26,291
Laurie's not my girlfriend.
I hate girls.

1169
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,555
Why doesn't anyone understand this?

1170
01:21:28,629 --> 01:21:30,221
Good. So does Lindsey.

1171
01:21:30,298 --> 01:21:31,993
Go worship your god.

1172
01:21:32,066 --> 01:21:34,466
- Hey.
- Brought you a present.

1173
01:21:34,535 --> 01:21:36,162
Thanks.

1174
01:21:36,237 --> 01:21:39,331
You, my dear, will be happy to know

1175
01:21:39,407 --> 01:21:42,376
that I talked to Paul
about his buddy Ben Tramer.

1176
01:21:42,443 --> 01:21:44,934
Oh, I thought you said
Ben Tramer was retarded.

1177
01:21:45,012 --> 01:21:49,142
<i>Yeah, but he's not
Shortbus retarded or anything.</i>

1178
01:21:49,217 --> 01:21:50,275
What? He's okay.

1179
01:21:50,351 --> 01:21:53,980
- I mean, you need a boyfriend!
- Annie, I don't need a boyfriend.

1180
01:21:54,055 --> 01:21:55,386
- No, that's not what I meant.
- I'm fine.

1181
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,048
- You need--
- Okay, Annie--

1182
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,956
Oh! Oh! Yes!

1183
01:21:59,026 --> 01:22:00,050
Yes, Annie!

1184
01:22:00,128 --> 01:22:02,323
Okay, ok--

1185
01:22:02,396 --> 01:22:03,658
All right, you're right.

1186
01:22:03,731 --> 01:22:04,993
I need a boyfriend.

1187
01:22:05,066 --> 01:22:06,829
So, what did he say?

1188
01:22:06,901 --> 01:22:09,836
He said, and I quote,

1189
01:22:09,904 --> 01:22:13,362
"Dude, she's fucking hot."

1190
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:15,341
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

01:22:20,081 --> 01:22:22,242
Oh, fuck, that's Paul.
I gotta go.

1193
01:22:22,316 --> 01:22:24,147
- Have fun.
- Thanks, I will.

1194
01:22:24,218 --> 01:22:25,879
- Bye, sexy.
- Bye.

1195
01:22:31,626 --> 01:22:32,888
Hi, baby.

1196
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,518
- What's up?
- How are you?

1197
01:22:34,595 --> 01:22:35,687
I'm good.
How are you?

1198
01:22:35,763 --> 01:22:36,923
Good.

1199
01:22:37,665 --> 01:22:41,624
You have to stop thinking
that we're dealing with a normal man here.

1200
01:22:41,702 --> 01:22:44,967
We're dealing with
a soulless killing machine,

1201
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:47,667
driven by pure animal instinct.

1202
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:52,812
Dr. Loomis, I'm going
to have to level with you.

1203
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,745
I read your book.

1204
01:22:54,815 --> 01:22:57,613
I know exactly who you are,
and frankly, I don't like you.

1205
01:22:57,685 --> 01:22:59,516
And I'll tell you something else.

1206
01:22:59,587 --> 01:23:03,250
I think you have created
quite the masterpiece of a monster

1207
01:23:03,324 --> 01:23:08,728
off the blood of this town,
because monsters sell books.

1208
01:23:08,796 --> 01:23:13,199
Please, just look at this photograph
on the cover of the book.

1209
01:23:13,267 --> 01:23:14,359
All right.

1210
01:23:16,337 --> 01:23:19,773
I first met Michael 17 years ago.

1211
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:25,403
When I first met him,
he was a sweet, charming little boy.

1212
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:29,176
But he had nothing inside.

1213
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:31,878
There was something missing, a void.

1214
01:23:31,953 --> 01:23:35,514
There was no conscience, no reason,

1215
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:41,187
even a rudimentary sense
of life or death, right or wrong.

1216
01:23:41,262 --> 01:23:45,028
Yeah. He's come back for her.

1217

And who is her?

1218
01:23:49,537 --> 01:23:53,098
He's come back for his baby sister.

1219

I know it in my bones, Sheriff.

1220

1221

I don't know, Sheriff, but...

1222
01:24:06,053 --> 01:24:08,283
it's not good.

1223
01:24:12,326 --> 01:24:16,228
If I break a promise I made a long time ago,

1224
01:24:16,297 --> 01:24:19,733

- Laurie?
- What, Tommy?

1238

I would like to return to the subject
we started earlier this evening.

No, the Boogey Man.

1241
01:25:10,251 --> 01:25:12,412
I need some closure on this topic.

1242
01:25:12,486 --> 01:25:14,010
I've heard all about this.

1243

What do you want to know, Tommy?

1244
01:25:16,557 --> 01:25:18,855
Why would he only attack kids
who don't believe?

1245
01:25:18,926 --> 01:25:21,053
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

1246
01:25:21,128 --> 01:25:23,722
Is it because if you believe,
then you're protected by his powers?

1247
01:25:23,798 --> 01:25:25,732
Okay, Tommy,
enough about the Boogey Man.

1248
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:26,858
It's nonsense.

Yeah. Why do you keep
avoiding the subject, Laurie?

- Maybe she is.
- Ooh, yeah.

About 17 years ago,
I respond to a 911

1292
01:29:06,754 --> 01:29:09,746
which turned out to be
the Myers woman's suicide.

1293
01:29:09,823 --> 01:29:14,920
And I see this beautiful,
innocent baby sitting in this bloody mess,

1294
01:29:14,995 --> 01:29:18,158
and I can't imagine this child growing up
with a stigma around her neck,

1295
01:29:18,732 --> 01:29:24,534
so I omit her from the report,
I drive her to another town,

1296
01:29:24,605 --> 01:29:26,869
and drop her off
at the nearest emergency room.

1297
01:29:26,941 --> 01:29:28,772
And I think that this
is going to be the end of it.

1298
01:29:28,842 --> 01:29:31,709

I find out from a friend of mine,

that he's adopted the baby.
