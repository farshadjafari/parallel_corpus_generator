1
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:55,737
Accused for illegal wealth
and possessing property..

2
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,472
..inspector Kadam has
proved one thing that..

3
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:00,411
Inspector Kadam has
proved one thing that..

4
00:01:00,482 --> 00:01:03,974
..no one can stop pollution,
population and corruption in India.

5
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:07,385
The corruption charges
against inspector Kadam..

6
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:09,980
..raise a big question
mark on the Goa police.

7
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:12,788
Everyone is corrupt.

8
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:15,694
There is no denial with the
fact that Inspector Rakesh Kadam..

9
00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:18,892
..is the new added virus in the
ongoing dirty game of corruption.

10
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:20,332
What big news, ma'am?

11
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:22,962
The real news will be when police
officers stop accepting bribes.

12
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:24,997
This is an everyday
occurrence in this country.

13
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,699
In addition to the charges even the
public is against Inspector Kadam.

14
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:30,642
Nitin. Go out and play.

15
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:32,339
They say that no matter
what their first names are..

16
00:01:32,414 --> 00:01:34,712
..the surnames of such
police officers is Corruption.

17
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:36,307
Reena Patni, Star News.

18
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:43,619
You wore the uniform today..
- I am going to the police station.

19
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:45,918
I have some work.

20
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:47,623
Don't worry.

21
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:50,590
Everything will be fine, Rakesh.

22
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:21,859
If there are a few more
police officers like him..

23
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,693
..then the country
will go to the dogs.

24
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,857
Rakesh Kadam has deceived
the people.

25
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,799
He should be publicly flogged.

26
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:30,838
Inspector Kadam has
proved one thing.

27
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:32,839
That on the first day of
their jobs..

28
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:34,465
..police officials get
their license for corruption..

29
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:35,804
..along with their uniforms.

30
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,375
Sir, you.

31
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:40,446
After so long.

32
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:41,808
Have some tea.

33
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,449
We just got the news that in Goa..

34
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,645
Savalkar.

35
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,551
At certain places in Goa inspector
Kadam's effigies were burnt.

36
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:48,611
This proves how widespread..

37
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:03,336
'Look, Kadam, don't be too hard.'

38
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:05,004
'Just take a step ahead.'

39
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,837
'And reap the benefits.'

40
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:08,933
'Just tell me how much you want.'

41
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,908
'Here.'

42
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:11,306
'You want to bribe me?'

43
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,539
'How much can you give me?'

44
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:15,346
'Half a million, a million.'

45
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,680
'I will make you all
dance to my tunes.'

46
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:19,979
'Go to your boss and
tell him just one week.'

47
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:22,947
'That's all. And his game is over.'

48
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:37,928
'The people are defaming the
entire police department.'

49
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:40,873
'These police officials are
openly demanding money now.'

50
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:42,569
'Under the table. Extra-income.'

51
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:45,511
'And the reason is you,
Mr. Rakesh Kadam, just you.'

52
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,912
'Mr. Kadam bought
this bungalow from me..

53
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:50,042
..and asked me to make
the agreement..

54
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,048
..in the name of his
relatives and not him.'

55
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,447
'Sir, that bungalow isn't mine.'

56
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:55,489
'I am being falsely accused.'

57
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,320
'And what about the bundles of
cash found in your jeep's dashboard?'

58
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:00,519
'Sir, that isn't mine I..
- Enough, Kadam, enough.'

59
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:01,896
'Enough is enough.'

60
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:06,332
'You cannot deny the fact
that you are a bloody disgrace..

61
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,959
..to the entire Goa
police department.'

62
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:11,800
Inspector Rakesh Kadam,
you are suspended.

63
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:22,447
Yes, Rakesh.

64
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:28,683
Megha, the more I
try to control myseIf..

65
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:33,653
..the more I stumble.

66
00:04:34,862 --> 00:04:37,456
I am not a corrupt police officer.

67
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:39,998
I am not a traitor.

68
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:48,299
But I don't know how...how long
will it take me to prove this?

69
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:54,772
I cannot let you and Nitin go
through this mental torture..

70
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:57,407
..for so long.

71
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:58,918
Why are you saying that?

72
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:02,751
We will face this together, Rakesh.

73
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:05,950
And I know that you are innocent.

74
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,427
Explain that to Nitin.

75
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:11,797
Tell him that his father was..

76
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:22,436
..an honest police officer.

77
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:23,870
Rakesh!

78
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:28,509
'Police officers are now
openly demanding money.'

79
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:29,642
Rakesh.

80
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:31,909
'The people are defaming the
entire police department.'

81
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:33,851
'Have him flogged publicly.'

82
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:35,821
'And the reason is
entirely you, Mr. Rakesh Kadam.'

83
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,914
'Just you.'

84
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:39,020
'He threatens me.
He is a corrupt officer, sir.'

85
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:41,419
'You are a bloody God
damn disgrace..'

86
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:42,963
'..to the entire Goa
police department.'

87
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:52,899
Rakesh!

88
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:24,802
Rakesh.

89
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:28,906
Inspector Rakesh Kadam was
an honest police officer.

90
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:32,442
He was doing his duty honestly.

91
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:34,410
Then why did he shoot himseIf?

92
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:36,746
He certainly pressed the trigger..

93
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:38,877
..but someone else
forced him to do it.

94
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:39,749
Who was he?

95
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,550
Who was he?
- Tell us his name, ma'am.

96
00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:44,015
Jaikant Shikre.

97
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,509
Just a minute. Just
a minute, Mr. Shikre.

98
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:04,568
Mrs. Kadam has said that..

99
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:07,614
..you are responsible
for her husband's death.

100
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:08,808
What do you have to say about that?

101
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:09,747
Democracy!

102
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:10,841
Anyone can say anything!

103
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,684
That poor lady is targeting me
to save her husband's reputation.

104
00:07:14,756 --> 00:07:15,984
But she doesn't know..

105
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:20,789
..you cannot prove yourseIf
innocent by accusing others.

106
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:23,660
But, Mr. Shikre,
Mrs. Kadam also states that..

107
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:25,995
..you run many illegal businesses.

108
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:27,557
What do I do?

109
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:28,997
I have a small
construction business.

110
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:30,529
And this hotel.

111
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:31,936
I serve foreign tourists.

112
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:32,973
Guests are God.

113
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,974
Mrs. Kadam says that..

114
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:38,910
..her husband shot himself
due to the pressure put by you.

115
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,969
I see.

116
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:41,014
Just a minute.

117
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:43,016
Here. Here. Here.

118
00:07:43,284 --> 00:07:44,273
Kill yourself.

119
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:45,614
I Jaikant Shikre am saying this.

120
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:46,845
Shoot yourseIf!

121
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,721
If people really listened to me..

122
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:52,618
..then actress Kareena
Kapoor would be Prime Minister.

123
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:57,355
Look, Rakesh Kadam was a
corrupt police officer.

124
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,892
His guilt kept pricking him.

125
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,991
So he killed himseIf.

126
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:06,303
If you still think I am wrong
then you can shoot me.

127
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,601
Shoot me, I don't have
any objection.

128
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,233
Punish me.

129
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:12,671
You will surely get punishment.

130
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:16,848
You will be punished
for your deeds.

131
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:18,814
You won't survive this time.

132
00:08:19,353 --> 00:08:20,285
You won't survive.

133
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:22,914
You have to die.

134
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:25,757
Just watch, Jaikant.

135
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:30,253
Now He will do justice.

136
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:31,461
Him.

137
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:23,010
''Singham.''

138
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:28,250
''The heart races.''

139
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:29,414
''The body trembles.''

140
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:31,457
''When you know he's coming.''

141
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,651
''Singham.''

142
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:37,260
''No hesitation.''

143
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:38,320
''No deviation.''

144
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,424
''Just destruction.''

145
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,661
''Singham.''

146
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:49,343
''He never spares the bad.''

147
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,904
''Embraces the good.''

148
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:54,970
''He is unequalled.''

149
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:56,277
''He is very strong.''

150
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,977
''Singham is a destroyer of evil.''

151
00:09:58,052 --> 00:09:59,644
''The heart races.''

152
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,709
''The body trembles.''

153
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:02,881
''When you know he's coming.''

154
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:03,981
''Singham.''

155
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:08,519
''No hesitation.''

156
00:10:08,596 --> 00:10:09,688
''No deviation.''

157
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:11,856
''Just destruction.''

158
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:12,990
''Singham.''

159
00:10:43,898 --> 00:10:48,335
''Has a honest heart.''

160
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:51,633
''Value him.''

161
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:57,071
''lt's a wonderful dream.''

162
00:10:57,345 --> 00:11:01,406
''Treasure him.''

163
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:04,013
''He's a child at heart.''

164
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:06,048
''Mischievous and fun.''

165
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:08,618
''But if you underestimate him.''

166
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,554
''You feel his anger.''

167
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:12,819
''He's like a fresh breath of air.''

168
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:14,918
''Wanders about freely.''

169
00:11:14,996 --> 00:11:17,590
''If you try and stop him.''

170
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:19,394
''You will feel his anger.''

171
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:23,870
''He never spares evil.''

172
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:28,500
''Showers love on the good.''

173
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:29,565
''He is unequalled.''

174
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:30,632
''He is very strong.''

175
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:32,645
''Singham is a destroyer of evil.''

176
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:34,044
''The heart races.''

177
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:35,070
''The body trembles.''

178
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,407
''When you know he's coming.''

179
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:38,509
''Singham.''

180
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:39,780
''Singham.''

181
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,549
''Singham.''

182
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:26,833
Hello, brother Singham.

183
00:12:53,694 --> 00:12:54,786
Sada, what..

184
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:56,421
What happened, Kelkar?

185
00:12:56,664 --> 00:12:58,632
Sir, Sada has borrowed
40,000 from Shivraman..

186
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,633
..on interest.

187
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,927
And he disappeared when it
was time to return the money.

188
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:04,963
But we found him and beat him up.

189
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,370
Yet he says that he
doesn't have money.

190
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,499
Sir, now they want to
file a case against him..

191
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:09,736
..and get him arrested.

192
00:13:09,977 --> 00:13:12,002
Yes, we will seize
his house and land..

193
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,770
..through the court
and recover my money.

194
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:23,888
Sada. Why didn't you
return his money?

195
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,486
Brother, you know sister
Suhasini is getting married.

196
00:13:30,598 --> 00:13:32,361
I spent all the money.

197
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:35,731
If they file a case then her
wedding will be called-off.

198
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:39,405
I said I will return
it in three months.

199
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:42,900
But they kept beating me all night.

200
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:50,678
You two took the law in your hands.

201
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,411
We had to, sorry for that.

202
00:13:56,023 --> 00:13:57,684
Why the..

203
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:07,727
Singham, this isn't right.

204
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:11,031
Those who break the law..

205
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:12,999
..I will break their bones,
Chandrakant.

206
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:14,935
The trial is over.

207
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:16,704
Now the judgment at my house.

208
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:18,301
''Singham.''

209
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:19,943
''Singham.''

210
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:22,473
50 crates.

211
00:14:23,017 --> 00:14:24,609
Go and make the
entry in the other one.

212
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:28,021
Where are the safe keys, father?
- Mother has them.

213
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:30,012
Mother!
- Why do you need the keys?

214
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:32,589
I need 40,000 rupees.
- Why?

215
00:14:32,993 --> 00:14:34,051
To give Sada.

216
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:37,424
He borrowed it from Chandrakant.

217
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:39,355
Now he wants to file a case.

218
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,965
If he registers a case
it will be humiliating.

219
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:44,031
The marriage will be called off.

220
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:45,772
Will you like it if the
wedding of a girl from our village..

221
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,828
..is called off, father?

222
00:14:46,974 --> 00:14:48,771
Mother. Mother.

223
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:50,737
What?
- The safe keys.

224
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:53,379
Give it.
- What happened?

225
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:56,376
If you are so concerned
about Sada's expenses..

226
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,974
..then why don't you think
about the government as well.

227
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,910
Why have you opened
such a big police station?

228
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:05,453
No one's ever arrested nor
is any case ever registered.

229
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:07,520
I am in-charge of my own village.

230
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:09,990
Every other person is a uncle,
friend or relative.

231
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:11,295
What can I do, mother?

232
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:12,988
Even you give your known retailers..

233
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:14,598
..your stuff on credit.

234
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:18,365
Father, if family don't help
family then who else will.

235
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:21,007
Brother, Singham is simply great.

236
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,741
Yesterday Manoj was
caught for spilling blood.

237
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:25,574
And he let him go.
- What?

238
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:26,905
Murder?

239
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:30,513
Mother, he had stolen a bottle
of blood from the blood bank.

240
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:32,876
You too, uncle. Murder.

241
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,309
Here, Sada.

242
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:35,377
Keep this.

243
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:36,820
And when will you return it?

244
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,282
Three months.
- I give you four months.

245
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:41,485
Four months means..
- Five months.

246
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:45,488
And you...next time
when you lend money..

247
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:46,827
..take it back decently.

248
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:48,859
And next time you borrow money..

249
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,334
..you will repay it on time.

250
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:52,498
Case dismissed.

251
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:56,909
What are you looking at,
Chandrakant?

252
00:15:57,945 --> 00:16:00,311
This is Bajirao
Singham's style of working.

253
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:01,336
''The heart races.''

254
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:02,439
''The body trembles.''

255
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:04,643
''When you know he's coming.''

256
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:06,379
''Singham.''

257
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:11,450
''No hesitation. No deviation''

258
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,425
''Just destruction.''

259
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:14,787
''Singham.''

260
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:22,527
''He never spares the bad.''

261
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,936
''Embraces the good.''

262
00:16:27,274 --> 00:16:29,469
''He is unequalled.
He is very strong.''

263
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:31,567
''Singham is a destroyer of evil.''

264
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,812
Shiva, we are on the spot.

265
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:43,523
The child's game is
about to get over in an hour.

266
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:47,359
Excuse me.
- Hello.

267
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:49,553
Subodh Rajaram Tapkar.
- Who is this?

268
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,562
Your daddy.

269
00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:52,295
Oh, daddy reminds me

270
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:54,061
..your son who is
playing at the sports complex..

271
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:55,825
..is going to be kidnapped
in a while.

272
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,800
What?
- Don't worry.

273
00:16:58,539 --> 00:16:59,665
We haven't done it yet.

274
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,868
We will do it if you
fail to give us ten million.

275
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:04,608
What nonsense.

276
00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:08,012
What the..

277
00:17:17,491 --> 00:17:19,618
Hello, Subodh, are you checking..

278
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:21,354
..whether your son is alive or dead?

279
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:24,358
Hey, what do you say?

280
00:17:24,431 --> 00:17:26,331
I don't have
so much money right now.

281
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,890
I can give 2.5 million.

282
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:30,869
Only 2.5 million you say.

283
00:17:31,004 --> 00:17:31,971
Why you..

284
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,631
You think we are beggars?

285
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,470
Is he your son or the neighbors..
- Give it to me.

286
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:38,773
Subodh, what are you doing?

287
00:17:38,946 --> 00:17:39,776
Bargaining?

288
00:17:39,947 --> 00:17:41,778
You are not buying
detergent for your home.

289
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:43,839
He is your only son.

290
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:46,720
Forget it, it's not your fault.

291
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:50,653
These days everyone is
looking for discounts.

292
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,956
You do read the paper, don't you?

293
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:56,362
Three months ago a
businessman called Sri Ram.

294
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,497
His son died.

295
00:17:58,031 --> 00:17:59,430
Sonny boy.

296
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:01,992
Your father doesn't love you.

297
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:04,967
I asked him for money
but he didn't give it.

298
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:06,933
I am sorry.

299
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:11,875
His body was found on the road.

300
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:13,240
But his killer wasn't found.

301
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:14,947
You must have seen on TV.

302
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:17,374
Jim Pereira, the
owner of Dreamland Hotel.

303
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:22,685
His dead body was found on
the terrace of his own hotel..

304
00:18:22,756 --> 00:18:25,486
..under the 500 liter water tank.

305
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,787
His killer wasn't found.

306
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,793
Shiva, who did we kill on
Valentine's day? - Bansal?

307
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:31,421
We killed Bansal on Holi.

308
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:33,763
Oh, yes, Hiren. Lover boy.

309
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:36,526
He was giving a rose
to his girIfriend.

310
00:18:36,904 --> 00:18:38,963
I gave him a bullet.

311
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:42,899
And do you know why I am
repeating these highlights?

312
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:47,679
You can do anything with
me but don't hurt my ego.

313
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:49,507
Now you decide, Subodh.

314
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:53,512
Do you value your money or your son?

315
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:56,820
I have lost my mind.

316
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,480
These days parents
aren't sentimental either.

317
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,787
No feelings, emotions, nothing.

318
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,927
They are getting practical.

319
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:03,855
The omelet has cooled down.

320
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:04,921
Get another one.

321
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:06,863
What?

322
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:07,995
Call him now.

323
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:09,466
I gave him a dose.

324
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:10,633
The money must be ready.

325
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:28,018
The auspicious time is passing away.

326
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:30,384
Gautam hasn't arrived yet.

327
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:33,985
Your son is returning to Shivgad
village after five years, uncle.

328
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:36,454
Yes, but he is late.

329
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:39,762
Look, here he comes.

330
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:41,661
He is here!

331
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:50,836
Greetings.

332
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:52,603
How are you, grandpa?
- We are fine.

333
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:53,373
Terrific, grandpa.

334
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:55,005
How are you?
- Hello. Hello. Hello.

335
00:19:55,048 --> 00:19:55,810
Nandu.

336
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:57,416
How are you?

337
00:19:57,885 --> 00:19:58,749
Yes.

338
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:00,010
Yes, Tavde.

339
00:20:00,854 --> 00:20:01,912
That godown order.

340
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:03,650
How are you, Gautam?

341
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:05,050
I am fine.

342
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:08,858
You are looking very good
without the glasses, grandpa.

343
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:11,760
Yes, dear. But today I
like your grandma more...

344
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:13,356
...without the glasses.

345
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:14,525
What are you saying?

346
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:16,766
Mother, start the program quickly.

347
00:20:16,837 --> 00:20:18,998
No, son, it is prayer
meeting and not a program.

348
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:19,970
That's exactly what I am saying...

349
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,972
...start the program quickly.

350
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:22,638
I have to go back by evening.

351
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:29,810
Just a minute.

352
00:20:29,883 --> 00:20:30,781
Priest, just a minute.

353
00:20:31,952 --> 00:20:32,884
Yes, Tavde.

354
00:20:32,953 --> 00:20:34,318
Has the payment been confirmed?

355
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:35,813
Okay, accept the payment...

356
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,083
...but don't give him the
delivery before I arrive.

357
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:38,323
Okay.

358
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:39,719
Yes, priest. Continue.

359
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:42,489
Of course, my attention is here..

360
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:45,956
Just a minute.

361
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:48,092
Program stop. I've a call.

362
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:50,497
Yes, Tavde.

363
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:55,438
No, no, send the tricycles
from the Pune godown. - Gautam.

364
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:56,600
What is going on here?

365
00:20:57,344 --> 00:20:58,868
Have you called us
here for the prayers.

366
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:00,777
...or for listening to
your phone conversations?

367
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:02,643
I am not doing it intentionally.

368
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:04,343
I have to look after
my work as well.

369
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:05,646
And we are sitting free here.

370
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:07,016
We don't have any work to do.

371
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:09,915
Gautam Cycles are
very renowned in Goa.

372
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,925
I have to work day and
night to keep up the name.

373
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,019
I plough my field day and night.

374
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:16,660
So do you expect me to come here...

375
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,358
...with my plough, axe and two ox's.

376
00:21:18,432 --> 00:21:20,457
Why are you villagers so
jealous of city people?

377
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:22,057
Great, Gautam.

378
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:24,336
Now you belong to the city.

379
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:26,571
You were raised in this village.

380
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,799
You received an
education in the village school.

381
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,706
But why would you remember that?

382
00:21:30,844 --> 00:21:33,335
Now you are Gautam Bhosle.

383
00:21:33,413 --> 00:21:36,007
Now you are no
longer our Gotya. Gotya.

384
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:40,010
Yuck. Papa's nickname was Gotya?

385
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:42,548
Look, Manikrao, you can curse me.

386
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:44,420
But don't call me Gotya.
- Why?

387
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:46,048
Do you feel embarrassed?

388
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:47,823
No matter how wealthy you become...

389
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:49,691
...but you will stay Gotya for us.

390
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:51,526
Gotya. Gotya.

391
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:54,527
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.

392
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:55,826
Gotya.

393
00:21:57,537 --> 00:22:00,404
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.

394
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:01,270
Gotya. - Shut up!

395
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,967
Shut up I say.
- What is going on?

396
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:06,835
Nothing they are...
intentionally calling me Gotya.

397
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:10,449
Look, I admit that we have
been calling him Gotya...

398
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:11,882
...since childhood.

399
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:13,577
But he is no longer the Gotya...

400
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:15,519
...who we used to
call Gotya in childhood.

401
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:18,689
He is a rich man now.

402
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,989
No one will call him Gotya now.

403
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:22,692
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.

404
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:24,897
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.

405
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:27,559
Gotya. Gotya. Gotya.

406
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:28,859
Who is it?

407
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:30,425
Who is saying that?

408
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:00,496
Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!

409
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:02,831
Sada, what happened?
- Ghost. Ghost. Ghost.

410
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:03,835
Ghost!

411
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:07,806
Kelkar, where are you going?

412
00:23:07,974 --> 00:23:10,909
Sir, we will have to
take a definitive step.

413
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:12,710
We will have to call the BSF.

414
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:13,837
BSF?
- Yes.

415
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:15,504
Will you call the army
to tackle the ghost?

416
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:18,549
BSF. Meaning Baba Sadanand Fakir.

417
00:23:21,455 --> 00:23:22,786
You look that way and
I will look this way.

418
00:23:22,856 --> 00:23:23,948
Alone?

419
00:23:24,658 --> 00:23:25,989
Why you...
- I am going.

420
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:27,391
Go.

421
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:30,787
lt's a thread.

422
00:23:30,964 --> 00:23:33,023
I have an auspicious thread.

423
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:34,966
Saibaba around my neck.

424
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:37,326
I am not scared of ghosts.

425
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:38,868
Ghosts are not real.

426
00:23:40,507 --> 00:23:41,838
Ghosts are real.

427
00:23:46,446 --> 00:23:48,073
Sister, even the police.

428
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:50,316
We will have to see
an action replay.

429
00:23:50,383 --> 00:23:50,974
Once more, sister.

430
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:51,949
Once more.
- Come on.

431
00:24:06,366 --> 00:24:07,264
You.

432
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:10,632
Aren't you that small timid girl?

433
00:24:10,904 --> 00:24:12,929
Gotya's daughter.
- Gautam Bhosle.

434
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:14,365
Yes, him.

435
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:17,436
Now you have grown up
to scare people.

436
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:20,947
I was just... passing time.
- Passing time.

437
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:24,744
The villagers would have lost
their time forever because of you.

438
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:26,985
And what if someone had hit you?

439
00:24:27,387 --> 00:24:28,615
So what was this?

440
00:24:28,922 --> 00:24:30,321
You did hit me.

441
00:24:31,658 --> 00:24:33,455
Come on, I will drop you home.

442
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:37,294
Come on.

443
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:41,593
Nandu, are you sure he comes
here everyday at this time.

444
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:43,295
But what do you want to do?

445
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,632
Apologize to Singham?

446
00:24:44,704 --> 00:24:46,831
Sorry? I want to take revenge.

447
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:47,839
Revenge.

448
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,908
He slapped me on my left cheek.

449
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:52,910
Now I will give him a tight
slap on his right one. - What?

450
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,005
Slap a police official.
And that too Singham.

451
00:24:56,082 --> 00:24:59,779
You will really
become a ghost after that.

452
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,647
So, Kelkar, these days...

453
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:03,416
...you are coming to the
temple everyday as well.

454
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,481
Because there's Aarti (holy
offering), Archana (worship)..

455
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:08,357
..Puja (veneration) and
Shanti (peace) in the temple.

456
00:25:25,412 --> 00:25:27,380
Sir, there are ghosts here.

457
00:25:42,495 --> 00:25:43,587
Kavya.

458
00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:51,495
I was thinking about you
the entire night. - What?

459
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:53,971
Oh no. I was
thinking the entire night...

460
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:56,672
...that I made a mistake.

461
00:25:56,943 --> 00:25:59,605
I shouldn't have slapped a girl.

462
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:00,972
I am sorry.

463
00:26:01,248 --> 00:26:03,842
If you want you can slap
me just like I slapped you.

464
00:26:03,884 --> 00:26:06,512
I..
- No, no. Not here.

465
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:08,582
I am respected here.

466
00:26:10,624 --> 00:26:12,922
Inspector Bajirao Singham.

467
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,827
You can tell me the place and time.

468
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:17,260
I will be there with my cheek. Okay.

469
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:18,863
Bye.

470
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:22,759
Sister, what was that grumpy saying?

471
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:24,963
He isn't grumpy. He is nice.

472
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:26,769
He was saying sorry.
- What?

473
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,307
Throw this at him.

474
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:30,267
He is leaving. Throw this at him.

475
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:32,506
Hit him, hit him.
- You are such a low-down person.

476
00:26:32,913 --> 00:26:34,608
You want to hit a police
official from your own village.

477
00:26:34,814 --> 00:26:35,872
That too Singham.

478
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:38,281
Anjali.

479
00:26:38,752 --> 00:26:40,652
Me? It was you...

480
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:42,013
That is crazy.

481
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,950
Megha, we will reopen this case.

482
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,457
We will appoint an
investigation committee again.

483
00:26:48,628 --> 00:26:50,960
This procedure takes a long time.

484
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:52,387
And even after that...

485
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:56,766
...it is not guaranteed that
your husband gets a clean chit.

486
00:26:56,836 --> 00:26:59,896
The police force is meant to
give justice to the public.

487
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,634
If you don't do justice
to your own officials...

488
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:04,801
...then how will the
people have faith in you?

489
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:07,903
I will try my best.

490
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:10,473
But we cannot deny the fact...

491
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:14,583
...that all evidence, all
charges in Rakesh Kadam's case...

492
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:15,882
...are against him.

493
00:27:18,892 --> 00:27:20,655
Sir, you have said so much...

494
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:23,887
...then say it confidently..

495
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:28,628
...my husband was guilty.

496
00:27:38,578 --> 00:27:42,014
Kavya, I used to bring
your grandma here...

497
00:27:42,282 --> 00:27:46,651
...all the way to Shinoli
30 kilometers on a cycle...

498
00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:49,551
...from our village to see a film.
- Wow!

499
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,779
I hope it doesn't
display too much weight...

500
00:27:51,858 --> 00:27:52,916
...otherwise how
will I eat the popcorn.

501
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:55,553
But if it is less then you
can eat the cheese popcorn.

502
00:27:55,862 --> 00:27:56,988
Give me a coin.
- Take off your sandal.

503
00:27:57,063 --> 00:27:58,428
Then you will know the exact weight.

504
00:27:58,665 --> 00:27:59,563
Take it off.

505
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:00,960
lt's a good start.

506
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:02,994
Then you can take your clothes off.

507
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:04,930
You will get the exact weight.

508
00:28:06,006 --> 00:28:06,973
What did you say?

509
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:07,998
What did you say?

510
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:08,933
What did you say?
- Grandpa.

511
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:09,805
Didn't you hear?

512
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,435
Have you lost your
hearing with your age?

513
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,804
I asked her to take off her clothes.

514
00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:17,749
I will... - What will you do?
What will you do?

515
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:20,242
You are living
beyond your time, old man.

516
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,617
Are you going to hit me?

517
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:23,552
Get lost.
- How dare you?

518
00:28:23,623 --> 00:28:25,989
How did you dare to touch him?
- Like this.

519
00:28:29,896 --> 00:28:31,955
If my villagers find
out about this...

520
00:28:32,032 --> 00:28:34,296
...then they won't spare you.

521
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:35,265
I see.

522
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,394
Go tell them!

523
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:40,029
Go call your villagers!

524
00:28:41,908 --> 00:28:42,966
She went to see a movie.

525
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:45,637
Some goons misbehaved with Kavya.

526
00:28:45,712 --> 00:28:48,442
I told them that if
anyone messes around...

527
00:28:48,515 --> 00:28:52,349
...with the girl from our village,
then the villagers won't spare him.

528
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:19,010
Has the movie ended?
- No, sir.

529
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,610
Five minutes are left.

530
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,612
Close the gate.

531
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,014
Stop. Stop.

532
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:29,255
No one will leave.

533
00:29:29,322 --> 00:29:30,448
Stop. Stop here.

534
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:31,888
Hey, stop here.

535
00:29:31,991 --> 00:29:33,822
We need to make an enquiry. Stop.

536
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:36,755
Someone misbehaved with this girl.

537
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:39,525
If you have the guts
then show yourseIf.

538
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,566
Come out.

539
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,329
But that is your problem.

540
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:43,629
Why are you bothering us?

541
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:50,832
When someone misbehaves
with your wife or sister...

542
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,434
...and you come
seeking help from the police.

543
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:54,476
And then if I say,
''That is your problem...

544
00:29:54,547 --> 00:29:56,538
...why do you drag me in
this'' then how will you feel?

545
00:29:57,784 --> 00:30:00,344
Stand quietly or you won't
be able to sit down again

546
00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:03,485
Anyone can act tough
wearing a police uniform.

547
00:30:03,656 --> 00:30:05,920
Anyone can be brave
with a gun in his hand.

548
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,691
If you have the guts then
let's see you without them.

549
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:09,454
Then I will show you who I am.

550
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:12,397
''Singham.''

551
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:13,994
''Singham.''

552
00:31:41,888 --> 00:31:43,685
''Singham.''

553
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,651
''Singham.''

554
00:31:46,326 --> 00:31:47,987
''Singham.''

555
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:49,994
''Singham.''

556
00:33:52,452 --> 00:33:53,384
No.

557
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,946
No.

558
00:33:56,756 --> 00:33:57,620
No. Don't hit me.

559
00:33:58,658 --> 00:33:59,682
Don't hit me.

560
00:34:01,694 --> 00:34:02,752
''Singham.''

561
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,627
''Singham.''

562
00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:11,469
''Singham.''

563
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:17,275
''Singham.''

564
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:56,377
This Hari looks more
like a nerd than a milkman.

565
00:34:56,482 --> 00:34:58,382
He broke my bike's
headlight with his cycle.

566
00:34:58,484 --> 00:35:00,918
But, brother Singham, he
spilled his milk as well.

567
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:10,729
I will...
- Hari, Hari, Hari, Hari.

568
00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:12,628
Stop. Stop, Hari. -
I'll cut him into pieces.

569
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:14,559
Don't be furious.

570
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:16,534
Balli is from our village.

571
00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:18,560
And if you beat him,
the poor chap will die.

572
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:20,435
Now cool down, come on.

573
00:35:20,973 --> 00:35:22,031
Do it.

574
00:35:22,942 --> 00:35:24,910
I am cooling down
because Singham said so, Balli.

575
00:35:24,944 --> 00:35:27,504
Otherwise I would have
killed you today, Balli.

576
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,690
You here?

577
00:35:41,861 --> 00:35:44,989
You know, Singham, my
diamond necklace was stolen.

578
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:47,931
At home! Come to the police station!

579
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,525
What ''Come to the station''?

580
00:35:49,702 --> 00:35:50,691
She is in trouble.

581
00:35:50,803 --> 00:35:52,794
Take her to the police station.

582
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:55,404
But, mother...
- I said go.

583
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:56,997
Shall we?

584
00:35:57,076 --> 00:35:58,065
Goodnight.

585
00:35:59,545 --> 00:36:01,274
Singham, someone has
stolen my purse.

586
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:03,974
Actually I had gone to the
market to buy something...

587
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,979
...and someone stole
my purse, Singham.

588
00:36:06,886 --> 00:36:07,910
Your mobile has been stolen?

589
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:09,820
From your home?

590
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,423
Where did you see it last?

591
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,452
With Nandu.

592
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,630
What now?

593
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:24,636
Singham, someone
snatched my bangles this time.

594
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,568
Look.

595
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:28,464
Seems like you are the
thief's favorite customer.

596
00:36:28,674 --> 00:36:29,641
How did he look?

597
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:30,903
He...

598
00:36:31,677 --> 00:36:32,769
Like him.

599
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:36,570
Fine, go home.

600
00:36:36,816 --> 00:36:38,943
I will catch your thief today. Go.

601
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:40,750
Bye.
- Bye.

602
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:42,919
Bye.
- Go!

603
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:48,658
Sir, I didn't steal it.

604
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:53,454
Even I know...that no one stole it.

605
00:36:53,799 --> 00:36:55,733
She inflicted the wound herseIf.

606
00:36:55,935 --> 00:36:57,766
With some thorn or glass.

607
00:36:58,538 --> 00:37:00,005
But why is she doing this?

608
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:02,999
The other day she said that
her mobile was stolen, isn't it?

609
00:37:03,276 --> 00:37:04,868
Yes, but we couldn't find it.

610
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:06,310
Do you have the number?
- Yes.

611
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:07,411
Dial it.

612
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:16,447
The number you have
dialed isn't valid.

613
00:37:18,257 --> 00:37:19,849
The number isn't valid.
That's the message.

614
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:28,863
If you like this song
then press star to copy it.

615
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:29,663
At one...

616
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:32,829
''Munni was defamed...
darling just for you.''

617
00:37:32,905 --> 00:37:33,530
At two.

618
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:36,700
''Sheila. Sheila's youth.''

619
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,471
''I am too sexy for you...''

620
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:40,512
''You won't get me.''

621
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,378
Nandu, how is your mother?

622
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:44,881
Absolutely fine, brother Singham.

623
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:47,309
Where is Nandu?

624
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:48,919
He is inside.

625
00:37:58,631 --> 00:38:00,292
What was that sound, Kelkar?

626
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,297
Seems like there is
someone here, Kelkar.

627
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,830
Seems like there is
someone behind the boxes, Kelkar.

628
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:09,297
Who could it be, Kelkar?

629
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,342
lt's a cat.

630
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:13,506
Come out. Come out.

631
00:38:14,013 --> 00:38:17,744
Stealing a purse, mobile!

632
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:19,717
I didn't steal. I am not a thief.

633
00:38:20,486 --> 00:38:21,384
No, brother Singham.

634
00:38:21,454 --> 00:38:23,615
I haven't stolen anything.
- Grandma, look what Nandu has done.

635
00:38:23,923 --> 00:38:26,483
Stealing in his own home...
- Enough is enough.

636
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:29,351
I am saying it to myseIf,
not to you.

637
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:31,624
Enough is enough!

638
00:38:31,764 --> 00:38:34,426
Grandma, I asked Nandu
to hide those things.

639
00:38:36,435 --> 00:38:38,801
Enough of excuses
and lies to meet you.

640
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,628
Enough is enough!

641
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,640
Kavya, what is this joke?

642
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:45,034
Why did you do this?
- Simple.

643
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:46,369
I love you.

644
00:38:55,321 --> 00:38:56,686
Don't you have any shame?

645
00:38:56,956 --> 00:38:59,390
In front of elders...
- Why?

646
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:00,618
ls it a crime in saying
it in front of the elders?

647
00:39:00,826 --> 00:39:02,225
And I just said
what is in my heart.

648
00:39:02,294 --> 00:39:03,522
Why are you surprised?

649
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:05,854
I didn't kiss you publicly.

650
00:39:07,633 --> 00:39:08,657
Do I say it or not.

651
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:09,928
Do I say it now?
When should I say it?

652
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:11,362
It would have taken years.

653
00:39:11,437 --> 00:39:13,871
Grandpa, when goons
misbehaved with me...

654
00:39:13,906 --> 00:39:15,669
...then why did you call Singham?

655
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:17,441
Because even you know...

656
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,239
...that he is the only one
in the entire village...

657
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:20,573
...who can fight them for me.

658
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,645
lsn't it?
- Yes.

659
00:39:22,915 --> 00:39:24,507
Grandma, if the would-be son-in-law...

660
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,915
...belongs to this
village then your son...

661
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:27,543
...will keep coming
home every month...

662
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,019
...and not once in five years.

663
00:39:29,488 --> 00:39:31,456
Yes or no?
- Yes.

664
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,851
Mother, it is important to know
the boy's family background...

665
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,725
...before the wedding.

666
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,989
And you know his family in and out.

667
00:39:39,265 --> 00:39:40,527
Yes, I do.

668
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:43,600
And I also know that they
have a wholesale business.

669
00:39:43,669 --> 00:39:47,435
So the boy will also
bring lots of gifts. - Yes.

670
00:39:47,873 --> 00:39:48,737
Aunty!

671
00:39:48,808 --> 00:39:50,503
See, everyone has accepted.

672
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,904
Now you say yes as well.

673
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:54,007
After that I will talk
to your family.

674
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,277
How can I straightaway say yes?
- I see.

675
00:39:58,551 --> 00:39:59,483
Now I get it.

676
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:02,880
You are having an affair
with Lakha's daughter Laxmi.

677
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:04,684
That Lakha...

678
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:07,882
Grandma, I don't have
an affair with anyone.

679
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,958
Then what is the problem?

680
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:10,619
Tell me. Tell me.

681
00:40:11,497 --> 00:40:13,488
Anjali, explain to your sister.

682
00:40:13,566 --> 00:40:14,362
lt's no good.

683
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:15,422
What do I explain to her?

684
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:16,490
She will never listen.

685
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:18,434
You know what happened once was...
- Quiet.

686
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:19,962
Kelkar.

687
00:40:20,072 --> 00:40:21,403
Kelkar, try to explain to her.

688
00:40:21,474 --> 00:40:22,805
You should understand.

689
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:23,807
Say yes.

690
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:26,606
You are getting past your
marriageable age. - Nandu!

691
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,470
Why are you scolding him?

692
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:30,908
That means you refuse.

693
00:40:31,317 --> 00:40:32,807
Fine, say no.

694
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:33,647
Say it.

695
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,686
Say it.
- Say it.

696
00:40:34,754 --> 00:40:35,948
Say it.
- Say it.

697
00:40:36,455 --> 00:40:37,513
- Yes, but- What?

698
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,581
Say that it's a no.
Say you don't love me.

699
00:40:39,658 --> 00:40:40,647
Say it.
- Say it.

700
00:40:40,726 --> 00:40:42,455
Tell grandma,
grandpa, tell me as well.

701
00:40:42,528 --> 00:40:43,460
Say it, say it.

702
00:40:43,996 --> 00:40:44,724
Why are you stammering?

703
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,660
Say it.
- Say it.

704
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:46,663
Oh no, then!

705
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:53,938
''Beloved. Beloved. ''

706
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:59,635
''What has my crazy heart done? ''

707
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:04,905
''Chosen you. Yes, you. ''

708
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:09,681
''My crazy heart has chosen you. ''

709
00:41:10,356 --> 00:41:15,623
''The heart soars in the skies.
Amongst the clouds''

710
00:41:15,828 --> 00:41:21,528
''Dancing to a new tune. ''

711
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,501
''The naughty heart is deceptive. ''

712
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,300
''The naughty heart fell for you. ''

713
00:41:27,406 --> 00:41:32,571
''The naughty heart
doesn't listen to me anymore. ''

714
00:41:32,645 --> 00:41:35,546
''The naughty heart is deceptive. ''

715
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:38,344
''The naughty heart fell for you. ''

716
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:44,356
''The naughty heart
doesn't listen to me. ''

717
00:42:10,783 --> 00:42:16,050
''The heart likes you.
Everything you do. ''

718
00:42:16,322 --> 00:42:21,817
''My only dream is to be with you. ''

719
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:27,355
''Spending the night with my
head placed on your shoulder. ''

720
00:42:27,433 --> 00:42:32,598
''Spending the day
holding your hand. ''

721
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:38,632
''What has happened to me?
I have lost my heart. ''

722
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:44,013
''What has happened to me?
I have found a new world. ''

723
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:47,518
''The naughty heart
is very deceptive. ''

724
00:42:47,586 --> 00:42:50,384
''The naughty heart fell for you. ''

725
00:42:50,456 --> 00:42:55,393
''The naughty heart
doesn't listen to me. ''

726
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:58,453
''The naughty heart is deceptive. ''

727
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,260
''The naughty heart fell for you. ''

728
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:06,464
''The naughty heart
doesn't listen to me. ''

729
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:11,833
''Beloved. Beloved. ''

730
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:17,574
''What has my crazy heart done? ''

731
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:23,048
''Chosen you. Yes, you. ''

732
00:43:23,522 --> 00:43:27,925
''My crazy heart has chosen you. ''

733
00:43:28,494 --> 00:43:33,659
''The heart soars in the skies.
Amongst the clouds''

734
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:39,496
''Dancing to a new tune. ''

735
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:42,639
''The naughty heart is deceptive. ''

736
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:45,472
''The naughty heart fell for you. ''

737
00:43:45,544 --> 00:43:50,504
''The naughty heart
doesn't listen to me anymore. ''

738
00:43:50,749 --> 00:43:53,684
''The naughty heart is deceptive. ''

739
00:43:53,752 --> 00:43:56,482
''The naughty heart fell for you. ''

740
00:43:56,555 --> 00:44:02,653
''The naughty heart
doesn't listen to me. ''

741
00:44:05,698 --> 00:44:07,359
Anjali, I forgot my mobile.

742
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,898
Go get it.

743
00:44:09,034 --> 00:44:11,332
Oh my. I'll take Lord's blessings.

744
00:44:28,654 --> 00:44:30,815
Are you leaving?
- No.

745
00:44:31,323 --> 00:44:33,757
My luggage got bored
lying around the house.

746
00:44:33,993 --> 00:44:35,051
So I thought why not air it.

747
00:44:35,861 --> 00:44:39,456
You are traveling by car?
- No, by a helicopter.

748
00:44:39,665 --> 00:44:40,927
I just need to attach a rotor.

749
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:45,996
When will you return?

750
00:44:46,805 --> 00:44:48,705
I will be back in 15-20 years, why?

751
00:44:48,974 --> 00:44:50,373
No...

752
00:44:52,444 --> 00:44:54,412
I wanted to say something.

753
00:45:02,321 --> 00:45:03,811
I...
- I what?

754
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:07,983
Love...

755
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:14,890
I love...Gotya.
- Gotya?

756
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:16,299
But I hate you.

757
00:45:16,468 --> 00:45:17,594
I hate you.

758
00:45:17,669 --> 00:45:18,533
Your father.

759
00:45:18,604 --> 00:45:19,468
This village.

760
00:45:19,538 --> 00:45:20,630
And I am not Gotya.

761
00:45:20,706 --> 00:45:22,367
And...what did you say
to my daughter.

762
00:45:22,474 --> 00:45:23,338
What did you say? - Father.

763
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:25,035
I...
- I...

764
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:28,804
Yes, Tavde.

765
00:45:29,348 --> 00:45:30,610
Send all the cycles
from the storehouse.

766
00:45:30,682 --> 00:45:31,444
Send all of them.

767
00:45:31,517 --> 00:45:32,711
Yes, where were we?

768
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:35,487
I...
- Yes, and...

769
00:45:35,687 --> 00:45:36,585
Love...

770
00:45:38,057 --> 00:45:39,820
Yes, Tavde.

771
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:42,884
Look, I won't be bankrupt
if one cycle goes missing.

772
00:45:43,028 --> 00:45:43,960
Send them all.

773
00:45:44,029 --> 00:45:46,589
Yes, what were you saying?

774
00:45:46,665 --> 00:45:47,962
I love...
- You.

775
00:45:48,067 --> 00:45:49,466
You..

776
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:50,927
Tavde.

777
00:45:51,303 --> 00:45:52,827
Tavde, to hell with you.

778
00:45:52,905 --> 00:45:54,600
To hell with my factory.

779
00:45:54,673 --> 00:45:56,641
To hell with the
name of Gautam cycles.

780
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:57,572
Burn it!

781
00:45:57,643 --> 00:45:58,769
Burn down the factory.

782
00:45:58,844 --> 00:46:00,311
Burn down the storehouse.
- I love you.

783
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:02,506
Burn everything!

784
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:06,376
Kavya, don't you dare give a
reply to his ''I love you''.

785
00:46:06,785 --> 00:46:08,343
He is the one who
gave a reply, father.

786
00:46:08,687 --> 00:46:10,382
I said ''I love you'' to him.

787
00:46:11,323 --> 00:46:11,880
Tavde.

788
00:46:11,957 --> 00:46:13,652
Tavde, come here and set me on fire.

789
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:14,986
Burn it down.

790
00:46:47,426 --> 00:46:48,688
He died too soon.

791
00:46:49,461 --> 00:46:50,723
What are you doing here?

792
00:46:50,796 --> 00:46:51,888
Condolence.

793
00:46:52,498 --> 00:46:53,726
He was a nice man.

794
00:46:53,966 --> 00:46:56,457
What happened wasn't nice.
- Get lost from here.

795
00:46:56,535 --> 00:46:58,628
Go away.
- You were supposed to die.

796
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,060
But he did instead.

797
00:47:00,305 --> 00:47:00,999
And all because of you.

798
00:47:01,707 --> 00:47:03,299
I asked him to vacate the place.

799
00:47:03,742 --> 00:47:05,937
But the rascal
refused and threw me out.

800
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:07,334
And he got so sentimental...

801
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:08,606
...that he started
speaking like a madman.

802
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,844
My wife Shanti's memories rest here.

803
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:16,344
My son Pappu grew in this house.

804
00:47:16,421 --> 00:47:18,855
Look, look, Pappu has passed away.

805
00:47:18,891 --> 00:47:20,756
Stop your nonsense, Jaikant.

806
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,659
I know everything.

807
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:25,659
You killed my son. You killed him.
- Wrong.

808
00:47:26,331 --> 00:47:28,891
Pappu was on a scooter
and a truck ran over him.

809
00:47:29,668 --> 00:47:30,828
I admit that it was my truck.

810
00:47:30,903 --> 00:47:32,336
But an accident is an accident.

811
00:47:32,938 --> 00:47:35,634
Why do you always make me a target?

812
00:47:35,974 --> 00:47:37,908
You said no. You put up a scene.

813
00:47:38,277 --> 00:47:39,676
And now you are accusing me.

814
00:47:39,945 --> 00:47:41,640
You are the murderer.

815
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,642
I am just the medium. The medium.

816
00:47:44,983 --> 00:47:46,848
Old man.

817
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:52,588
Do anything but don't
hurt Jaikant Shikre's ego.

818
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:54,382
Sign on the papers and...

819
00:47:54,459 --> 00:47:55,687
...handover the
possession of the house to me.

820
00:47:56,562 --> 00:47:58,496
Otherwise you have a big family...

821
00:47:58,564 --> 00:48:00,031
...and my truck is waiting outside.

822
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:02,594
One funeral after the other.

823
00:48:03,702 --> 00:48:05,533
One funeral after
another will continue.

824
00:48:18,684 --> 00:48:20,948
I have lost my mind.
- What now?

825
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:22,452
One vote less!

826
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:38,927
Jaikant, your arrest warrant...

827
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:41,537
Won't be issued now.

828
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:42,899
We are coming directly
from the court.

829
00:48:43,275 --> 00:48:44,435
You have been granted bail
in the Dutta murder case.

830
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:45,668
I had to.

831
00:48:45,877 --> 00:48:47,936
That's an old case,
three years ago.

832
00:48:48,013 --> 00:48:49,275
And I was the third accused.

833
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:51,676
But, sir, you have been
granted conditional bail.

834
00:48:51,984 --> 00:48:53,349
You will have to go to
Shivgad police station...

835
00:48:53,418 --> 00:48:55,318
...for 15 days and sign. That's all.

836
00:48:55,387 --> 00:48:56,911
What? Where is it?

837
00:48:57,322 --> 00:48:59,756
lt's a small village near
the Maharashtra Goa border.

838
00:49:03,895 --> 00:49:05,385
So I will have to go to Shivgad?

839
00:49:05,564 --> 00:49:08,294
You don't need to go to Shivgad.

840
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,895
Vittal Dharvi who
looks after our docks...

841
00:49:11,303 --> 00:49:12,497
...will come in handy now.

842
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:20,409
Kelkar.

843
00:49:22,314 --> 00:49:22,905
Who are they?

844
00:49:22,981 --> 00:49:24,539
Conditional bail, sir.

845
00:49:24,616 --> 00:49:25,514
For signing.

846
00:49:25,584 --> 00:49:26,516
They are from Goa.

847
00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:28,281
Call them.

848
00:49:28,754 --> 00:49:30,278
Hey, wait.

849
00:49:30,689 --> 00:49:32,316
Name.
- Jaikant Shikre.

850
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:36,985
Father's name.

851
00:49:39,898 --> 00:49:40,694
What happened?

852
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:43,931
Didn't your mother ever
tell you your father's name?

853
00:49:46,405 --> 00:49:49,602
Sir, we are Vitthal Dalvi's men.

854
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:52,535
Jaikant can't come
here so we came here.

855
00:49:56,648 --> 00:49:58,445
I was at the docks on the rocks.

856
00:49:58,717 --> 00:49:59,684
I was slightly busy.

857
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:01,384
There is lot of work.

858
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,982
That's why I sent my men.

859
00:50:03,055 --> 00:50:04,750
Otherwise I..
- Where is Jaikant Shikre?

860
00:50:05,023 --> 00:50:05,921
Goa, sir.

861
00:50:06,725 --> 00:50:08,317
We need to sign for 15 days,
isn't it?

862
00:50:08,393 --> 00:50:09,382
We will do that.

863
00:50:10,929 --> 00:50:11,793
And this..

864
00:50:13,398 --> 00:50:16,890
Extra-income, token, good luck.

865
00:50:17,302 --> 00:50:18,428
Consider it anything you want.

866
00:50:30,982 --> 00:50:31,812
lt's 10 o'clock.

867
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:34,075
I want Jaikant here
before 2 o'clock.

868
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:35,645
And I won't take any excuses that..

869
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:37,484
..he is ill, someone died in
his family, the car broke down..

870
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:39,490
..or the road is too bad.

871
00:50:39,758 --> 00:50:41,055
I want Jaikant here in four hours..

872
00:50:41,326 --> 00:50:43,590
..even if the entire India is closed.

873
00:50:43,795 --> 00:50:45,422
Otherwise a warrant will
be issued in his name..

874
00:50:45,497 --> 00:50:46,896
..and that dog will be in jail.

875
00:51:22,801 --> 00:51:24,530
What's going on.
- I don't no.

876
00:51:49,494 --> 00:51:50,426
Where is he?

877
00:51:50,996 --> 00:51:51,894
Where is that inspector?

878
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:54,624
Bajirao.
- Sir has gone for his rounds.

879
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:55,996
Call him.

880
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:58,796
Tell him Jaikant Shikre is waiting.

881
00:51:58,970 --> 00:51:59,766
Tell him.

882
00:52:02,407 --> 00:52:03,669
Let him come back.

883
00:52:07,712 --> 00:52:08,872
''Singham.''

884
00:52:11,983 --> 00:52:13,382
''Singham.''

885
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:17,883
''Singham.''

886
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:20,982
''Singham.''

887
00:52:24,496 --> 00:52:27,488
Sir, Bajirao Singham.

888
00:52:28,867 --> 00:52:29,925
Jaikant Shikre.

889
00:52:31,403 --> 00:52:32,370
So?

890
00:52:32,904 --> 00:52:34,303
Why is it so crowded here?

891
00:52:34,573 --> 00:52:36,063
He is no hero here for autographs.

892
00:52:36,575 --> 00:52:37,974
He is a criminal here to sign.

893
00:52:40,812 --> 00:52:42,643
Hey! Hey!

894
00:52:43,949 --> 00:52:45,507
Don't you know me?

895
00:52:45,717 --> 00:52:46,809
My power.

896
00:52:47,953 --> 00:52:48,942
I do.

897
00:52:50,055 --> 00:52:51,488
You are a murderer.

898
00:52:52,624 --> 00:52:53,818
I have read your file.

899
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:55,519
And saw your power as well.

900
00:52:56,661 --> 00:52:58,754
You came running here in
four hours like a dog.

901
00:52:59,464 --> 00:53:00,362
Show me your lD.

902
00:53:00,866 --> 00:53:02,527
I am losing my mind!

903
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:03,863
Tell him, Shiva.

904
00:53:04,035 --> 00:53:05,366
Vitthal, explain to him.

905
00:53:05,704 --> 00:53:07,501
He doesn't know who he
is picking a fight with.

906
00:53:08,874 --> 00:53:10,808
lt will become
difficult for you to live.

907
00:53:16,615 --> 00:53:18,378
I swear it.

908
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,283
I am Jaikant Shikre.
- What happened, brother Singham?

909
00:53:21,353 --> 00:53:23,753
Any problem? - lt is nothing,
please everyone go out.

910
00:53:23,989 --> 00:53:25,854
Let us know if
anything is wrong, Singham.

911
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:27,280
Axes, daggers, pickaxe.

912
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,621
We have brought truckload of weapons.

913
00:53:28,994 --> 00:53:30,894
Everyone please go out.

914
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:32,489
Kelkar, take Gundya out.

915
00:53:32,697 --> 00:53:33,857
He is just an ordinary goon.

916
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:36,994
Who did he call ordinary?

917
00:53:37,802 --> 00:53:38,666
You.

918
00:53:40,505 --> 00:53:43,030
You are very arrogant
about your post, isn't it?

919
00:53:43,842 --> 00:53:47,903
I can get you fired from
this post, and right now.

920
00:53:49,314 --> 00:53:54,479
I can make you feel
like a worm, right now.

921
00:53:55,587 --> 00:53:59,421
I will rearrange the
interior of this place that..

922
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:02,585
..it will look more like a
morgue and not a police station.

923
00:54:02,861 --> 00:54:04,351
Why you..

924
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,671
Hey..
- Move..

925
00:54:17,842 --> 00:54:19,366
Stop. What's going on?

926
00:54:19,744 --> 00:54:22,611
You dare threaten our
Singham in our village.

927
00:54:22,681 --> 00:54:24,376
Balli, what are you doing?

928
00:54:24,749 --> 00:54:26,717
He won't leave from here alive.

929
00:54:26,785 --> 00:54:28,719
But what are you all doing?
- Inspector.

930
00:54:29,287 --> 00:54:30,311
Stop this charade.

931
00:54:30,522 --> 00:54:32,012
Trying to scare me by
collecting your people.

932
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,850
You dog! Your mother..

933
00:54:34,926 --> 00:54:36,052
No, Sada.

934
00:54:39,598 --> 00:54:40,587
These people have gone mad.

935
00:54:40,632 --> 00:54:42,759
They can do anything.
Let's leave from here first.

936
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:44,701
Brother Singham, you can arrest me.

937
00:54:44,769 --> 00:54:47,329
But I want to pierce his chest..

938
00:54:47,405 --> 00:54:49,737
..just like I pierced his car.

939
00:54:49,908 --> 00:54:51,637
Anyone dare to touch Singham..

940
00:54:51,843 --> 00:54:53,470
..I will cut his hands.
- Aunty!

941
00:54:53,545 --> 00:54:56,708
We won't allow garbage
from outside in Shivgad.

942
00:54:56,781 --> 00:54:57,941
Understand.

943
00:55:02,687 --> 00:55:03,745
Did you hear?

944
00:55:04,356 --> 00:55:05,288
Did you see?

945
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:06,557
Did you understand?

946
00:55:06,725 --> 00:55:08,989
What the entire village did
when you raised your voice.

947
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:14,398
Just imagine what they will do
to you when I raise my voice.

948
00:55:14,566 --> 00:55:15,965
Right now.

949
00:55:17,268 --> 00:55:18,462
What did you think?

950
00:55:19,037 --> 00:55:21,597
He is just as ordinary inspector.
He will be scared of us.

951
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,341
You are the one that has
wet his pants, right now.

952
00:55:26,378 --> 00:55:32,647
If you touch me then they will
cut you to pieces. Right now.

953
00:55:33,485 --> 00:55:37,319
This is my village and I
this village's, Jaikant Shikre.

954
00:55:37,822 --> 00:55:39,551
Kelkar, bring the file.

955
00:55:52,504 --> 00:55:55,667
Come and sign here for the
next 14 days like a coward.

956
00:55:59,477 --> 00:56:03,709
Otherwise.. I will lose my mind.

957
00:56:14,526 --> 00:56:15,424
Get the car.

958
00:56:15,593 --> 00:56:16,685
Brother, sit in the car.

959
00:56:18,463 --> 00:56:19,691
Jaikant sir, please forgive me.

960
00:56:19,764 --> 00:56:21,356
I didn't know he will do this.

961
00:56:21,766 --> 00:56:22,960
I didn't know, sir.

962
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:24,627
Please, I beg you.

963
00:57:02,974 --> 00:57:04,737
Jaikant sir, it is too hot.

964
00:57:04,976 --> 00:57:06,000
Please sit in the car.

965
00:57:11,382 --> 00:57:12,781
Why is this glass still intact?

966
00:57:13,952 --> 00:57:15,351
I have found out, brother.

967
00:57:15,687 --> 00:57:16,449
What is the connection?

968
00:57:16,654 --> 00:57:17,552
There is no connection.

969
00:57:17,622 --> 00:57:19,249
He has been posted here
only because of his merit.

970
00:57:19,324 --> 00:57:21,417
And he is the favorite
of his village.

971
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:31,525
If I solve that, there'll
be a problem here. Got it?

972
00:57:31,603 --> 00:57:32,900
Nonsense, disconnect the call.

973
00:57:34,739 --> 00:57:36,400
Come, come. - Greetings. - Come.

974
00:57:40,411 --> 00:57:41,378
Take a seat.

975
00:57:42,747 --> 00:57:45,545
What a sweet child.

976
00:57:46,885 --> 00:57:47,943
What do you want?

977
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,281
Do you want Bournvita or Chocolate.

978
00:57:52,757 --> 00:57:53,587
Yes, madam.

979
00:57:53,758 --> 00:57:56,522
You gave us an appointment
from your busy schedule..

980
00:57:56,594 --> 00:57:57,720
What are you saying?

981
00:57:57,896 --> 00:58:00,524
Phadnis and Abbas told me
that you are in trouble..

982
00:58:00,598 --> 00:58:01,860
..and you want to meet me.

983
00:58:02,233 --> 00:58:02,961
I said very good.

984
00:58:03,334 --> 00:58:05,700
Nonsense. And anyway what else
we do sitting on this chair.

985
00:58:06,004 --> 00:58:07,403
We serve the people.

986
00:58:09,374 --> 00:58:11,808
Tell me.. how can I help you?

987
00:58:12,343 --> 00:58:13,970
Sir, I want you to
reopen my husband..

988
00:58:14,345 --> 00:58:17,439
..Inspector Rakesh Kadam's file.

989
00:58:17,982 --> 00:58:19,506
Order a CBI inquiry.

990
00:58:22,987 --> 00:58:24,420
CBI inquiry?

991
00:58:25,623 --> 00:58:30,458
Madam, I feel you are gravely
shocked by your husband's death.

992
00:58:33,932 --> 00:58:35,024
This is a open and shut case.

993
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,392
There cannot be an inquiry about it.

994
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:37,832
lt only accumulates dust.

995
00:58:40,471 --> 00:58:41,870
I suggest that you go home now.

996
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,937
Call some priest.

997
00:58:44,008 --> 00:58:45,407
Do some prayers.

998
00:58:46,578 --> 00:58:50,480
And apologize for the sins
your husband has committed.

999
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:52,743
Bribe-taker!

1000
00:58:58,389 --> 00:59:03,486
You and I both know who
needs to conduct prayers.

1001
00:59:08,433 --> 00:59:12,665
Phadnis, you are a public servant.

1002
00:59:13,338 --> 00:59:14,965
Waste of time! Nonsense!

1003
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,867
You saw a helpless woman and
you thought of helping her?

1004
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:20,741
Hey, Abbas..

1005
00:59:20,879 --> 00:59:23,507
If you want to help her so
desperately, resign your job..

1006
00:59:23,648 --> 00:59:26,583
And go and adopt that child
and sit in that lady's lap.

1007
00:59:26,885 --> 00:59:29,911
Don't waste my time here.

1008
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:32,512
If you bring her here again...

1009
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:55,771
What is wrong, father?

1010
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,880
Why is everyone so quiet?

1011
00:59:57,916 --> 01:00:00,407
Your transfer orders
have arrived four days ago.

1012
01:00:02,387 --> 01:00:03,513
Oh this.

1013
01:00:03,688 --> 01:00:04,382
This..

1014
01:00:04,455 --> 01:00:07,390
Son, you didn't even inform us.

1015
01:00:07,492 --> 01:00:09,756
Mother, why do I tell you about the
letter that doesn't mean anything?

1016
01:00:09,827 --> 01:00:11,818
I didn't understand.

1017
01:00:12,363 --> 01:00:14,991
Father, I have been
transferred to Goa.

1018
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,465
How can I leave my family?

1019
01:00:17,769 --> 01:00:19,862
And you know very well
that not just you two..

1020
01:00:19,938 --> 01:00:21,929
..but the entire Shivgad
is my family.

1021
01:00:22,407 --> 01:00:23,874
You have already decided, son.

1022
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:26,476
You should have also thought that..

1023
01:00:26,544 --> 01:00:31,811
..when you make your family,
your people, your village..

1024
01:00:31,883 --> 01:00:36,980
..proud in the big city then
your father will proudly say..

1025
01:00:37,956 --> 01:00:41,722
''Inspector Bajirao
Singham is from our village''.

1026
01:00:42,627 --> 01:00:43,753
''Our village. ''

1027
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:48,362
Kavya, I have news for you.

1028
01:00:48,566 --> 01:00:50,830
I have been transferred to Goa city.
- Really?

1029
01:00:51,002 --> 01:00:52,902
Wow, Singham! That is wonderful news.

1030
01:00:53,004 --> 01:00:54,494
You are coming to Goa.

1031
01:00:54,706 --> 01:00:57,698
But I want to see your Gotya's
face while giving this news.

1032
01:00:57,809 --> 01:01:00,607
Your Gotya will be completely shaken.
- Don't say that.

1033
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:01,743
Actually to be honest.

1034
01:01:01,813 --> 01:01:04,805
Even I want to see Gotya's..
Papa's reaction.

1035
01:01:04,983 --> 01:01:06,382
He will be..

1036
01:01:07,018 --> 01:01:09,043
lt was Singham, wasn't it?
- Yes.

1037
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,344
He has been
transferred here, isn't it?

1038
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:11,010
Yes.

1039
01:01:11,289 --> 01:01:12,586
He was talking about me, isn't it?

1040
01:01:12,824 --> 01:01:13,916
Actually he was asking about you.

1041
01:01:13,992 --> 01:01:14,924
What was he asking?

1042
01:01:17,028 --> 01:01:19,895
How is papa?
- He must not have said papa.

1043
01:01:19,931 --> 01:01:20,955
He must have said
something else. What did he say?

1044
01:01:21,032 --> 01:01:24,024
He said papa.
- Be honest.

1045
01:01:24,302 --> 01:01:25,360
He said Gotya.

1046
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:27,729
I knew it.

1047
01:01:28,339 --> 01:01:31,467
Now he will insult me in Goa as well.
- Papa!

1048
01:01:31,576 --> 01:01:36,411
Erase his name from your life,
your mobile right now.

1049
01:01:36,848 --> 01:01:37,906
Erase it.

1050
01:01:38,483 --> 01:01:39,643
They are all partners in crime.

1051
01:01:40,718 --> 01:01:41,810
Erase it.

1052
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,679
I know it.
Everyone's mixed up in it.

1053
01:01:45,356 --> 01:01:46,448
I'll see them.

1054
01:01:46,524 --> 01:01:48,992
What? - Mother, Singham's
been transferred to Goa.

1055
01:01:49,394 --> 01:01:50,588
Inspector, Goa Police.

1056
01:02:10,648 --> 01:02:12,980
No, I won't let you go. Not at all.
- Sir, I only have this much now.

1057
01:02:13,051 --> 01:02:15,485
Try to understand.
Let's understand each other. - Yes.

1058
01:02:15,586 --> 01:02:16,450
What is this?

1059
01:02:16,587 --> 01:02:17,611
One note.

1060
01:02:17,989 --> 01:02:19,957
One note can only run the country.

1061
01:02:19,991 --> 01:02:21,618
But not my home.

1062
01:02:21,692 --> 01:02:22,556
Give me another one.

1063
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:23,622
Sir.

1064
01:02:26,931 --> 01:02:28,558
I see, it's a fake note.

1065
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:30,560
Where did you get
this fake note from?

1066
01:02:30,868 --> 01:02:32,460
How many such notes do you have?

1067
01:02:32,904 --> 01:02:33,871
That is okay.

1068
01:02:33,938 --> 01:02:36,463
I will deposit it and
give you a receipt. - Yes.

1069
01:02:36,874 --> 01:02:38,068
I know the DSP..

1070
01:02:38,342 --> 01:02:39,741
..but still you
bring me here every time.

1071
01:02:39,811 --> 01:02:41,574
Come on, finish it now.

1072
01:02:41,646 --> 01:02:42,738
Let us go, sir.

1073
01:02:42,814 --> 01:02:44,406
We just send the money to the DSP.

1074
01:02:44,482 --> 01:02:45,312
Tell us what you want?

1075
01:02:45,383 --> 01:02:46,042
Just tell us and
get over with this.

1076
01:02:46,317 --> 01:02:47,579
We want to go.
Its business time, sir.

1077
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:48,945
Acting smart.
- What smart, sir?

1078
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,954
We just sent the money recently.
Just tell us what you want.

1079
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:52,853
Welcome, sir.

1080
01:02:54,358 --> 01:02:55,620
Sub-inspector Phadnis, sir.

1081
01:02:55,993 --> 01:02:57,620
Sub-inspector Abbas. - Sir.

1082
01:02:57,995 --> 01:02:59,724
Head Constable Salunkhe, sir.

1083
01:03:01,999 --> 01:03:03,899
And they are all the
constables on duty, sir.

1084
01:03:04,836 --> 01:03:06,633
The control room is on this side.

1085
01:03:06,904 --> 01:03:07,928
And your cabin this way.

1086
01:03:08,005 --> 01:03:10,633
From Peter's road to Old Goa
the entire area is under us, sir.

1087
01:03:14,345 --> 01:03:15,369
This is your chair, sir.

1088
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,338
In all there are
three beat stations, sir.

1089
01:03:17,482 --> 01:03:18,540
In our area.

1090
01:03:19,484 --> 01:03:20,610
Shall I order for tea, sir?

1091
01:03:21,352 --> 01:03:21,818
No.

1092
01:03:21,886 --> 01:03:22,944
Okay, sir.

1093
01:03:42,773 --> 01:03:46,436
Shocked. Shocked. Shocked.

1094
01:03:47,545 --> 01:03:48,477
What is it?

1095
01:03:49,013 --> 01:03:51,846
You got a 440 volt shock
after 300 kilometers away.

1096
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:53,817
What did you think?

1097
01:03:54,652 --> 01:03:56,916
Your transfer was normal?

1098
01:03:57,822 --> 01:03:58,789
Wrong.

1099
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,648
You came here at my will.

1100
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:03,891
You have come in
Jaikant Shikre's area.

1101
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:05,724
Welcome to Goa, Singham.

1102
01:04:06,797 --> 01:04:08,287
What is his village's name?

1103
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:08,923
Shivgad

1104
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,969
Tell me where it is?

1105
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:14,963
You called me to a village..

1106
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,373
..which doesn't exist on Goa's map.

1107
01:04:19,477 --> 01:04:20,444
Me.

1108
01:04:21,279 --> 01:04:23,577
That is why I called you here.

1109
01:04:24,348 --> 01:04:28,011
The ministers and
police follow my order here.

1110
01:04:29,387 --> 01:04:32,481
This is my system.

1111
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,851
Before this, another inspector
was acting too smart here.

1112
01:04:37,061 --> 01:04:39,791
Right on this chair,
in this uniform.

1113
01:04:39,997 --> 01:04:43,831
Right on this chair,
he shot himseIf.

1114
01:04:45,336 --> 01:04:48,430
You will die similarly.

1115
01:04:48,839 --> 01:04:52,297
You thrashed me real bad,
thanks to this very khaki uniform..

1116
01:04:52,577 --> 01:04:54,704
I swear on your khaki uniform..

1117
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,545
I will annihilate you.

1118
01:04:58,683 --> 01:05:01,811
Not easily. But gradually.

1119
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,720
You can do anything, Singham..

1120
01:05:05,723 --> 01:05:08,317
..but never hurt
Jaikant Shikre's ego.

1121
01:05:09,527 --> 01:05:13,725
Now you will die a
thousand deaths before you die.

1122
01:05:14,932 --> 01:05:19,562
Now it's your turn.

1123
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,275
Sir, the police
doesn't have any evidence..

1124
01:05:51,346 --> 01:05:52,506
..against Jaikant Shikre.

1125
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:54,105
Because he brings people
from Karnataka border..

1126
01:05:54,149 --> 01:05:55,912
..and runs all his illegal business.

1127
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,586
Jaikant's hotel
business is just a cover-up.

1128
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:04,121
He runs kidnapping, extortion and
illegal construction businesses.

1129
01:06:04,192 --> 01:06:06,626
That's why inspector Rakesh
Kadam wanted to expose him.

1130
01:06:06,895 --> 01:06:09,420
But Jaikant used his power..

1131
01:06:09,464 --> 01:06:11,898
..and got him accused
for corruption.

1132
01:06:12,901 --> 01:06:14,994
He started torturing him mentally.

1133
01:06:15,637 --> 01:06:18,504
His own department
didn't help him either.

1134
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,902
He was absolutely alone.

1135
01:06:21,576 --> 01:06:25,342
So alone that..he killed himseIf.

1136
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:30,448
Sir, right on this chair..

1137
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:35,115
Sir, this wasn't a suicide.
lt was a murder.

1138
01:06:42,497 --> 01:06:46,024
Sir, I am certain that inspector
Kadam was not a corrupt officer.

1139
01:06:46,568 --> 01:06:48,627
Even you know Jaikant Shikre..

1140
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:51,134
Until today the law
hasn't found single evidence..

1141
01:06:51,206 --> 01:06:53,299
..against Jaikant Shikre.

1142
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:56,242
And the anti-corruption department..

1143
01:06:56,311 --> 01:06:58,472
..caught inspector Kadam
red-handed with the money.

1144
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:02,038
Our law acts on evidence.

1145
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:06,478
Without evidence the police
department cannot do anything.

1146
01:07:07,255 --> 01:07:08,984
We have to do our duty.

1147
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:11,116
But not against the law.

1148
01:07:11,326 --> 01:07:12,623
According to the law.

1149
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,535
Singham. I have set
your kitchen stuff.

1150
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:22,471
The supermarket is right
in the front.

1151
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,564
If you need anything
then go get it from there.

1152
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:26,607
And tomorrow the newspaper man,
cable-man, electrician..

1153
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:27,369
..everyone is coming.

1154
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:29,034
So please don't forget.
- Kavya.

1155
01:07:29,911 --> 01:07:32,573
If it wasn't you.. then
there would've been someone else.

1156
01:07:41,523 --> 01:07:42,490
Singham.

1157
01:07:43,925 --> 01:07:44,892
Singham.

1158
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:49,556
Singham.

1159
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:58,337
Scared.

1160
01:07:59,174 --> 01:08:01,108
Get used to this darkness.

1161
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:04,506
Because from today your
life will be in darkness.

1162
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:07,244
Welcome to Goa, Singham.

1163
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:10,416
Who was it?

1164
01:08:14,656 --> 01:08:15,452
Sir.

1165
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:17,448
The phone from which
you received the call..

1166
01:08:17,559 --> 01:08:20,119
..was stolen from Madgaon
market yesterday afternoon.

1167
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:22,089
Here is a fax of its report.

1168
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:24,456
The phone is on
switch-off mode since last night.

1169
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,365
That's why we couldn't track it.

1170
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:30,497
Minister Narvekar has
chosen Jaikant Shikre..

1171
01:08:30,572 --> 01:08:34,474
..as his main
candidate for the elections.

1172
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:41,312
Jaikant Shikre will contest the
elections from the Rai Nagar area.

1173
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:45,616
Hello.

1174
01:08:45,887 --> 01:08:47,946
Sir, there's a murder in
progress in VTS colony.

1175
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:49,490
Come quickly, sir. Come quickly.

1176
01:08:56,231 --> 01:08:57,163
What happened, sir?

1177
01:08:57,432 --> 01:09:00,629
Murder..
- Murder. That's the film going on.

1178
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:02,036
We are watching it.

1179
01:09:07,242 --> 01:09:09,267
Someone played a prank on you, sir.

1180
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:18,451
''My luscious lips.''

1181
01:09:19,254 --> 01:09:22,087
''Your craving heart.''

1182
01:09:22,357 --> 01:09:24,917
Welcome to Goa, Singham.

1183
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:07,935
What happened, Singham?

1184
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:11,071
All the lines in your route are busy.

1185
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,536
Actually the traffic and
the routes here belong to me.

1186
01:10:15,076 --> 01:10:17,408
Because this is my city.

1187
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:19,604
Welcome to Goa, Singham.

1188
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,349
Long live..
- ..brother Narvekar!

1189
01:10:27,422 --> 01:10:29,617
Long live..
- ..brother Narvekar!

1190
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:32,153
Long live..
- ..brother Narvekar!

1191
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,421
Long live..
- ..brother Narvekar!

1192
01:10:34,462 --> 01:10:36,555
Long live..
- ..brother Narvekar!

1193
01:10:40,268 --> 01:10:41,496
What happened, Singham?

1194
01:10:43,605 --> 01:10:46,005
This same hand
grabbed my thumb that day.

1195
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,402
Today this hand is saluting me.

1196
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:53,546
I cannot say ''Give
me this hand, Thakur''.

1197
01:10:55,183 --> 01:10:57,879
Because you will have to
shoot yourseIf tomorrow..

1198
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,386
..with the same hand.

1199
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:03,355
Welcome to Goa, Singham.

1200
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:16,296
I have been selected
for the Goa election.

1201
01:11:19,474 --> 01:11:21,408
I have taken my first step.

1202
01:11:21,876 --> 01:11:23,935
Now simply keep walking ahead.

1203
01:11:24,012 --> 01:11:26,344
Get rid of the opposition.

1204
01:11:27,515 --> 01:11:31,246
He will surely win.
- Jaikant Shikre will win.

1205
01:11:31,286 --> 01:11:34,346
He will surely win.
- Jaikant Shikre will win.

1206
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,118
Sorry, Kayva, I just
saw your missed call.

1207
01:11:41,429 --> 01:11:43,556
lt's been a week, I haven't met you.

1208
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:44,560
What can I do?

1209
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,399
I have been posted
on day and night duty.

1210
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:48,264
And the time that I get in between..

1211
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,435
..the DSP hands me cases to solves.

1212
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,007
Cycle theft. Electric meter theft.

1213
01:11:53,074 --> 01:11:55,065
Arresting street gamblers.

1214
01:11:55,143 --> 01:11:57,577
Move this. Let us go.

1215
01:11:58,413 --> 01:11:59,880
I will call you back.

1216
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,446
Don't you see there
is checking going on?

1217
01:12:01,516 --> 01:12:03,177
To hell with your checking.

1218
01:12:03,251 --> 01:12:04,275
Move the barricade.

1219
01:12:04,452 --> 01:12:05,578
Whose car do you think this is?

1220
01:12:07,922 --> 01:12:09,082
Whose street do you think this is?

1221
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:13,458
Everything here belongs to us.

1222
01:12:13,628 --> 01:12:15,425
We are Jaikant Shikre's men.

1223
01:12:17,565 --> 01:12:19,556
Why the..
- Move it.

1224
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:21,093
Move it.

1225
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:27,031
Drinking and driving.

1226
01:12:27,108 --> 01:12:28,575
Abused on-duty inspector.

1227
01:12:28,643 --> 01:12:29,871
Didn't cooperate with the police.

1228
01:12:29,944 --> 01:12:30,501
Charge them.

1229
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:34,142
Singham, I can press
charges against you.

1230
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:36,874
You didn't cooperate
with the citizens.

1231
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:38,578
Public harassment and violence.

1232
01:12:38,653 --> 01:12:41,144
You took undue
advantage of your uniform.

1233
01:12:41,456 --> 01:12:43,583
Don't lodge any case.

1234
01:12:43,858 --> 01:12:45,223
And no charges will be
pressed against them.

1235
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,054
Let them go. These are my orders.

1236
01:12:47,228 --> 01:12:48,456
But, sir..
- Shut up.

1237
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:51,598
I am your senior. Will you
teach me, Bajirao Singham?

1238
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:54,026
Come on.

1239
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:09,510
This is routine here.

1240
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:12,852
Whether there's a
system in politics or not..

1241
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:17,085
..but there is surely
politics in the system.

1242
01:13:21,429 --> 01:13:24,330
The police didn't support Kadam.

1243
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:28,029
The DSP didn't support you.

1244
01:13:28,503 --> 01:13:30,437
So you want me to support you.

1245
01:13:33,641 --> 01:13:35,871
What is your name?
- Sir, Bajirao Singham.

1246
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,068
Bajirao.

1247
01:13:38,446 --> 01:13:42,906
Bajirao, this is not
about your duty and justice.

1248
01:13:43,017 --> 01:13:47,181
lt's about guts and foolishness.

1249
01:13:47,822 --> 01:13:52,953
Thinking about walking
barefooted on fire is guts, no doubt.

1250
01:13:53,194 --> 01:13:56,095
But actually walking
on it is foolishness.

1251
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:59,865
If you try to harm him,
you will be ruined.

1252
01:13:59,934 --> 01:14:01,959
But, sir, give me one chance.

1253
01:14:02,036 --> 01:14:03,503
Your support.
- What support?

1254
01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:05,038
Do I look like a fool who
is trying to explain you?

1255
01:14:05,106 --> 01:14:06,835
Have you lost your mind?

1256
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,374
Who do you think Shikre is?

1257
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:09,568
You think he is a
tea-vendor of your village..

1258
01:14:09,844 --> 01:14:10,606
..who sells liquor instead of tea..

1259
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:13,074
..and you can just
arrest him and lock him up.

1260
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:18,442
His monthly income can
fund you and your village..

1261
01:14:18,953 --> 01:14:21,478
..for an entire year.

1262
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:25,624
His network is very strong.
Nonsense.

1263
01:14:27,195 --> 01:14:29,322
The police is with him.
The public is with him.

1264
01:14:30,231 --> 01:14:32,028
I suggest sprinkle
this water on your face..

1265
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:33,327
..and come to your senses.

1266
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:36,370
Do your duty and don't finger him.

1267
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,003
Shirodkar, I was saying.

1268
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:43,335
This time only billboards
won't work..

1269
01:14:46,214 --> 01:14:48,205
Why are you standing here?
What are you staring at?

1270
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:49,477
Am I reciting the Ramayana here?

1271
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:52,543
You want a medal. Get lost.

1272
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:18,612
Think about it once again, Singham.

1273
01:15:21,316 --> 01:15:25,912
ls your decision to resign
and return to Shivgad right?

1274
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:28,079
If I stay, then I won't
be able to stop myseIf.

1275
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:31,119
I don't know what I will do.

1276
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:32,554
Kavya, let him go.

1277
01:15:33,361 --> 01:15:35,124
Otherwise he will
get the same threats.

1278
01:15:35,563 --> 01:15:37,087
The same torture.

1279
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:41,227
And in the end..
- Fine. Leave.

1280
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:43,897
But can I ask you something.

1281
01:15:44,305 --> 01:15:46,398
What will you say to your
villagers after you return?

1282
01:15:47,308 --> 01:15:48,969
That I accepted defeat and returned.

1283
01:15:50,011 --> 01:15:53,412
Singham, the other day
when you were fighting..

1284
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:56,143
..with the goons for me
I felt that no matter what..

1285
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,476
..but he won't let
anything wrong happen.

1286
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:08,587
And today if my father
asks me who I want to marry..

1287
01:16:09,931 --> 01:16:11,262
..then what will I say?

1288
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:17,395
One who is running away
instead of facing his problems.

1289
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:18,962
I am not running away, Kavya.

1290
01:16:19,507 --> 01:16:20,496
I am not running away.

1291
01:16:26,314 --> 01:16:28,111
I was born in a respected family.

1292
01:16:30,084 --> 01:16:31,915
Was raised in a holy place.

1293
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:34,146
Lived amongst good people.

1294
01:16:35,623 --> 01:16:38,592
I did my duty amongst people
that respect the law and justice.

1295
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:43,186
There is no law here nor
does anyone respect justice.

1296
01:16:43,364 --> 01:16:44,490
lt's a swamp. Complete swamp.

1297
01:16:46,634 --> 01:16:50,297
If I hurl a stone in it
then I will get dirty.

1298
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:57,435
Bajirao, you're looking tense.

1299
01:16:58,279 --> 01:16:59,473
Will you like to
have one? lt's chilled.

1300
01:17:01,115 --> 01:17:02,173
Come on.

1301
01:17:06,654 --> 01:17:11,421
Uncle. If you go then
they will hurt mummy too.

1302
01:17:25,473 --> 01:17:27,373
Are you scared of them?
- Yes.

1303
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:34,104
'You will die a thousand deaths.'

1304
01:17:35,216 --> 01:17:36,274
'Welcome to Goa, Singham.'

1305
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,319
'He will surely win!'

1306
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:44,456
'Shut up. I am your senior.'

1307
01:17:44,492 --> 01:17:46,427
'And you teach me? Bajirao Singham.'

1308
01:17:46,427 --> 01:17:48,452
'Do your duty and don't finger us.'

1309
01:17:49,063 --> 01:17:51,531
'Before you another
inspector before you tried his best.

1310
01:17:51,966 --> 01:17:55,629
'He killed himseIf.'

1311
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:42,014
What's wrong? Hurry up.

1312
01:18:51,926 --> 01:18:54,394
What is happening? Start it quickly.
He will kill us..

1313
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,004
''Singham.''

1314
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,115
''Singham.''

1315
01:19:39,373 --> 01:19:40,465
''Singham.''

1316
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,262
''Singham.''

1317
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:41,358
''Singham.''

1318
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,907
''Singham.''

1319
01:20:48,142 --> 01:20:50,269
''Singham.''

1320
01:20:50,444 --> 01:20:52,344
''Singham.''

1321
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:58,449
''Singham.''

1322
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,478
Brother, don't get tense.
I will handle it.

1323
01:22:41,555 --> 01:22:42,180
Don't be tense.

1324
01:22:42,256 --> 01:22:42,984
Listen to me.

1325
01:22:43,057 --> 01:22:44,183
Listen. I will handle it.

1326
01:22:44,258 --> 01:22:45,816
I will deal with the matter, okay.

1327
01:22:46,093 --> 01:22:46,923
Don't be tense.

1328
01:22:48,362 --> 01:22:49,386
Write the case.

1329
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:50,922
Disruption of public property.

1330
01:22:50,998 --> 01:22:51,965
Threatened to kill a police officer.

1331
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,000
And also attacked him.

1332
01:22:53,467 --> 01:22:54,832
Now I will show them.

1333
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,067
What happened?
- Nothing, nothing.

1334
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,037
Write, write!

1335
01:22:59,106 --> 01:23:01,336
Why, do you have a problem?
- Problem?

1336
01:23:02,209 --> 01:23:04,234
What is the point in
registering this case, sir?

1337
01:23:05,012 --> 01:23:07,071
Do you know whose men they are?

1338
01:23:07,548 --> 01:23:10,415
Jaikant Shikre.
- I know.

1339
01:23:11,118 --> 01:23:13,951
The same Jaikant Shikre
who killed inspector Kadam.

1340
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:15,486
And police officers like you..

1341
01:23:15,856 --> 01:23:19,087
..who forget your
conscience and serve him. - Sir.

1342
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:23,393
Don't force me, it is easy to say.

1343
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:25,527
What did you do the other day?

1344
01:23:26,233 --> 01:23:28,929
You let the goons go because of
the DSP. - Be quiet, Savalkar.

1345
01:23:29,003 --> 01:23:30,300
I am not scared of anyone.

1346
01:23:31,305 --> 01:23:32,431
I am not scared of anyone.

1347
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:34,498
I have heard such
lectures many times..

1348
01:23:34,575 --> 01:23:36,042
..in my years of service.

1349
01:23:37,011 --> 01:23:39,445
I came here as an angry young man.

1350
01:23:40,314 --> 01:23:43,306
But these seniors turned
me into Gandhiji's monkey.

1351
01:23:43,884 --> 01:23:45,545
Don't see, don't hear, don't speak.

1352
01:23:46,487 --> 01:23:47,385
What do you care?

1353
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:49,117
You want to fight everyone.

1354
01:23:49,423 --> 01:23:51,288
Fight them. Kill them.

1355
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:54,059
You will get over your
honesty in two days.

1356
01:23:54,328 --> 01:23:56,387
No one will support you. No one.

1357
01:23:58,132 --> 01:24:01,898
Okay, this constable
Savalkar will support you.

1358
01:24:02,403 --> 01:24:04,303
There are just six
months left for my retirement.

1359
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:07,839
I will support you for 180 days.

1360
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,006
I will see what you can do.

1361
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:12,475
This case..

1362
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:17,545
I wish you had done your
duty just as well as you speak.

1363
01:24:18,285 --> 01:24:20,276
Bajirao Singham.

1364
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:24,883
You arrested my men.

1365
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,859
Jaikant's furious.

1366
01:24:27,928 --> 01:24:32,365
You are furious. So I came
here to calm down the matter.

1367
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,124
And.. Oh my.

1368
01:24:34,935 --> 01:24:35,560
Shall I sit on the chair?

1369
01:24:36,003 --> 01:24:38,938
Otherwise you might kick
the chair later and say..

1370
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:42,568
''Until I ask you to sit,
stand silently.''

1371
01:24:43,444 --> 01:24:45,412
''This is a police station
and not your father's house.''

1372
01:24:53,821 --> 01:24:56,381
Phadnis, am I right?

1373
01:24:57,024 --> 01:24:59,083
Order for tea. With ginger.

1374
01:24:59,493 --> 01:25:00,391
So, Singham.

1375
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,260
Let them go.

1376
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:05,525
I have lodged a case.
- Then tear it.

1377
01:25:06,233 --> 01:25:07,165
lt's a government record.

1378
01:25:08,269 --> 01:25:09,258
lt's illegal to tear it.

1379
01:25:09,403 --> 01:25:14,136
I will get four new books for you.

1380
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:15,839
Tear it.

1381
01:25:20,414 --> 01:25:22,473
Don't think too much.
I mean it seriously, tear it.

1382
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:30,357
Bravo.

1383
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:45,067
That's exactly what
I was explaining to you.

1384
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:47,532
This useless anger..
- Why did you tear the case?

1385
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:50,410
Why did you tear the case?

1386
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:53,446
Why did you tear the case?

1387
01:26:02,456 --> 01:26:07,359
Singham, do you know who I am?

1388
01:26:08,028 --> 01:26:10,019
Who is Jaikant?
- Tell me.

1389
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:13,896
Tell me who you are.
- Sir, tea.

1390
01:26:16,904 --> 01:26:17,928
Do you know who he is?

1391
01:26:19,273 --> 01:26:20,171
He is Chotu.

1392
01:26:20,641 --> 01:26:23,974
He serves tea, works hard
and honestly and earns money.

1393
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:25,442
Who are you?

1394
01:26:26,914 --> 01:26:29,906
A criminal born out of corruption.

1395
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:32,478
What is your stature?

1396
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:33,984
Tell me.

1397
01:26:34,121 --> 01:26:35,019
Tell me.

1398
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:44,495
Now I will show you your stature.

1399
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:49,235
He planted money in Kadam's jeep.

1400
01:26:49,436 --> 01:26:51,427
Now we will plant
liquor barrels in his jeep.

1401
01:27:02,349 --> 01:27:03,509
Make a smuggling case.

1402
01:27:03,984 --> 01:27:04,575
Call the media.

1403
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:16,086
Singham, what is going on?

1404
01:27:16,463 --> 01:27:17,452
Have you lost your mind?

1405
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:20,259
First you charged him for liquor.
Then for violence.

1406
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:21,596
Then you tore up the
case report yourseIf..

1407
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:22,601
..and locked him up.

1408
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:23,602
What is going on?

1409
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:25,064
You don't own this place.

1410
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:29,572
Sir. Shiva Naik tore
the case report himseIf.

1411
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:31,338
Hey!

1412
01:27:33,013 --> 01:27:34,344
Yes, sir. I saw it too.

1413
01:27:34,615 --> 01:27:37,083
Yes, sir. I saw it too.

1414
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:38,140
I see.

1415
01:27:39,353 --> 01:27:41,583
So you all think you are too smart.

1416
01:27:42,256 --> 01:27:45,248
Fine. Shiva Naik
tore up the case report.

1417
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,958
Yet I order you to
release him right now.

1418
01:27:49,296 --> 01:27:50,923
Give me in writing.

1419
01:27:51,265 --> 01:27:52,323
Then I will think about it.

1420
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:54,967
Do you know who you are talking to?

1421
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:56,431
I am your senior..
- Quiet.

1422
01:27:57,538 --> 01:27:59,062
I know who I am talking to.

1423
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,603
To an officer that comes
down to bail the goons out.

1424
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:05,278
Our duty is to
apprehend the criminals.

1425
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:07,447
For that you don't
need power or posting.

1426
01:28:07,481 --> 01:28:08,641
You just need guts.

1427
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:09,950
Guts.

1428
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:12,314
You are talking to the
DSP of this zone. The DSP.

1429
01:28:12,386 --> 01:28:14,251
And you are talking
to Bajirao Singham.

1430
01:28:14,888 --> 01:28:17,618
And he has the courage and
strength to be just with the right..

1431
01:28:17,891 --> 01:28:19,153
..and wrong with the wrong.

1432
01:28:19,326 --> 01:28:23,660
I..I..I..
- What?

1433
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:25,297
Will you dismiss me?

1434
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:27,163
Suspend me? Go ahead.

1435
01:28:27,601 --> 01:28:29,398
These things might
make a difference to you.

1436
01:28:29,536 --> 01:28:30,468
lt doesn't make a difference to me.

1437
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:32,337
I will go back to my village,
work hard..

1438
01:28:32,406 --> 01:28:33,930
..and fuIfill my needs.

1439
01:28:34,141 --> 01:28:38,202
My needs are less that is
why my conscience is strong.

1440
01:28:39,513 --> 01:28:40,571
Shut up!

1441
01:28:40,981 --> 01:28:44,007
You are an ordinary inspector from a
small village.. - City or village.

1442
01:28:44,084 --> 01:28:46,484
The government gives
us similar uniforms.

1443
01:28:46,553 --> 01:28:48,350
lt bears the emblem of a lion.

1444
01:28:48,522 --> 01:28:50,490
But mine is here, on my chest.

1445
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:53,025
You dare argue with your senior.

1446
01:28:53,427 --> 01:28:55,486
With your senior.
- No.

1447
01:28:56,063 --> 01:28:58,122
I am arguing with a public servant..

1448
01:28:58,265 --> 01:29:02,429
..who is the criminal
Jaikant Shikre's servant.

1449
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:05,904
Don't forget that
I control 10 police stations and..

1450
01:29:05,973 --> 01:29:08,305
And I control only
this police station.

1451
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:10,471
Anyone who interferes
in my matters..

1452
01:29:10,544 --> 01:29:13,274
..I will break his legs and
make him beg on the streets.

1453
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:15,345
I swear.

1454
01:29:20,954 --> 01:29:21,943
What is all this?

1455
01:29:22,456 --> 01:29:23,423
Get back to your homes.

1456
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,459
Move back.

1457
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:31,525
Move back.

1458
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:34,894
Sawant, where are you. Get the car.

1459
01:29:35,135 --> 01:29:37,103
Just a minute. I will be right back.

1460
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,103
Just a minute.

1461
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:42,599
You have become great.

1462
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:46,305
You are now more
famous than superstars.

1463
01:29:48,115 --> 01:29:51,278
You have become really big.

1464
01:30:12,539 --> 01:30:13,437
What happened?

1465
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:15,864
Shocked.

1466
01:30:16,543 --> 01:30:19,273
I came here all alone
in front of you.

1467
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:21,407
Shocked.

1468
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:25,643
Come on, touch me.

1469
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:28,420
Touch me.

1470
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:30,082
Touch me.

1471
01:30:30,157 --> 01:30:31,454
What is this?

1472
01:30:32,192 --> 01:30:34,956
You think you are a hero
after arresting some of my men.

1473
01:30:35,262 --> 01:30:38,493
You have seen lions on television,
movies, circus.

1474
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,435
You never saw a lion
roaming in a jungle.

1475
01:30:43,003 --> 01:30:44,595
You never saw him hunt.

1476
01:30:45,572 --> 01:30:49,133
When the lion attacks
his enemy falls flat.

1477
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:53,904
This is a villager's hand, Jaikant.

1478
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:56,915
lt has been strengthened
by ploughing the fields.

1479
01:30:57,451 --> 01:31:00,113
They never begged before
anyone and never will.

1480
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:02,515
You are so arrogant because
of this uniform, isn't it?

1481
01:31:03,323 --> 01:31:06,292
10 minutes. I can
dismiss you in 10 minutes.

1482
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,486
Then do it.

1483
01:31:07,861 --> 01:31:08,623
Get me dismissed.

1484
01:31:09,296 --> 01:31:10,388
That is exactly what I want.

1485
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:13,558
That Jaikant Shikre
dismissed a police inspector.

1486
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:16,432
Jaikant Shikre was
scared of a police officer.

1487
01:31:17,137 --> 01:31:20,595
Jaikant Shikre lost to an inspector.

1488
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:23,402
I swear.

1489
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:31,209
You might have seen three
lions on the police cap.

1490
01:31:31,985 --> 01:31:33,452
The fourth one is right here.

1491
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,384
Here.

1492
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:38,324
If you awaken
it..you will pay for it.

1493
01:31:41,628 --> 01:31:43,994
Now I have lost it.

1494
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:50,029
Jaikant Shikre.

1495
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:54,433
Now it's your turn.

1496
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:56,969
''The heart races.''

1497
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:58,068
''The body trembles.''

1498
01:31:58,145 --> 01:32:00,079
''When you know he's coming.''

1499
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:01,444
''Singham.''

1500
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:05,876
''No hesitation.''

1501
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:06,977
''No deviation.''

1502
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:09,022
''Just destruction.''

1503
01:32:09,089 --> 01:32:10,351
''Singham.''

1504
01:32:13,527 --> 01:32:18,226
''He never spares the bad.''

1505
01:32:18,298 --> 01:32:22,496
''Embraces the good.''

1506
01:32:22,569 --> 01:32:23,627
''He is unequalled.''

1507
01:32:23,904 --> 01:32:24,928
''He is very strong.''

1508
01:32:25,005 --> 01:32:26,870
''Singham is a destroyer of evil.''

1509
01:32:27,307 --> 01:32:28,433
''The heart races.''

1510
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:29,407
''The body trembles.''

1511
01:32:29,476 --> 01:32:31,876
''When you know he's coming.''

1512
01:32:31,945 --> 01:32:33,139
''Singham.''

1513
01:32:34,915 --> 01:32:36,280
Calm down.

1514
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:37,439
The elections are near.

1515
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:40,351
The elections. Brother,
please disconnect the call.

1516
01:32:41,989 --> 01:32:44,822
I want to solve your problems.

1517
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:48,357
Politicians will only try
to make themselves famous.

1518
01:32:48,395 --> 01:32:54,265
But who will solve the
electricity problem in the suburbs?

1519
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:55,991
Me.

1520
01:32:57,137 --> 01:32:58,297
And foreign tourists.

1521
01:32:58,338 --> 01:33:01,466
Due to them, Goa's revenue is high..

1522
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:03,339
..who will give them safety?

1523
01:33:03,844 --> 01:33:04,333
Me.

1524
01:33:04,511 --> 01:33:08,072
And if I don't fuIfill my duty..

1525
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:13,212
..then you can burn my
effigy in any lane I pass through.

1526
01:33:14,121 --> 01:33:15,145
Great.

1527
01:33:15,222 --> 01:33:16,883
He speaks so well, isn't it?

1528
01:33:20,627 --> 01:33:22,060
I..that..I..

1529
01:33:23,597 --> 01:33:24,928
I..that..I..

1530
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,594
I..that..I..

1531
01:33:27,968 --> 01:33:29,265
And the water where
there are no taps..

1532
01:33:29,336 --> 01:33:31,566
I mean the taps that
still don't have water..

1533
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:34,464
..you can lay my coffin there.

1534
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:41,172
And those who..

1535
01:33:41,348 --> 01:33:44,283
And whosever's
demands are not fuIfilled..

1536
01:33:44,384 --> 01:33:47,581
..then I will give my life..life..

1537
01:33:47,854 --> 01:33:48,479
Jai Hind.

1538
01:33:48,855 --> 01:33:49,378
Jai Hind.

1539
01:33:49,556 --> 01:33:51,524
I am done, done, I am done.

1540
01:33:55,295 --> 01:33:56,125
Nonsense.

1541
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:59,325
I mean, ladies and gentlemen..

1542
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:00,889
Our leader is a little bit a..

1543
01:34:04,605 --> 01:34:05,401
What is this?

1544
01:34:05,472 --> 01:34:06,370
Trying to scare me.

1545
01:34:07,007 --> 01:34:08,235
You cannot do anything.

1546
01:34:08,442 --> 01:34:10,000
I got Shiva out on bail.

1547
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:10,907
Could you do anything?

1548
01:34:11,411 --> 01:34:13,003
There is no reason
to be scared of him.

1549
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,378
Get the car. No need
to be scared of him.

1550
01:34:16,383 --> 01:34:17,407
Yes.

1551
01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:19,413
Check the car trunks.

1552
01:34:19,953 --> 01:34:22,285
These days there are
bombs planted in the trunks.

1553
01:34:23,890 --> 01:34:24,447
Bomb.

1554
01:34:26,426 --> 01:34:27,859
Open the boot. Open the boot.

1555
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:28,587
What happened?

1556
01:34:29,162 --> 01:34:30,220
Open it.

1557
01:34:32,065 --> 01:34:33,123
What happened? There is nothing.

1558
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,128
''Singham.''

1559
01:34:36,136 --> 01:34:37,433
''Singham.''

1560
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:42,235
''Singham.''

1561
01:34:43,276 --> 01:34:44,038
Get the car.

1562
01:34:49,282 --> 01:34:51,307
Sir, can I say something?

1563
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:55,049
Challenging him openly in his house..

1564
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:57,090
..and scaring him in the rally.

1565
01:34:57,324 --> 01:34:58,552
How will that help, sir?

1566
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:01,324
When you step on a
snake he writhes around..

1567
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:03,295
..and makes a mistake.

1568
01:35:03,597 --> 01:35:04,894
I see.

1569
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:06,394
I didn't know.

1570
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,459
There are no snakes in my house.

1571
01:35:08,935 --> 01:35:10,027
Only lizards.

1572
01:35:10,203 --> 01:35:11,261
Yes, there are no snakes in my house.

1573
01:35:11,838 --> 01:35:12,964
But he is a snake!

1574
01:35:14,007 --> 01:35:15,304
It's written in the Bhagavad Gita.

1575
01:35:16,209 --> 01:35:19,576
That arrogant people die
due to their arrogance.

1576
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:23,516
He will surely make a
mistake in his arrogance.

1577
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:25,178
Then I will show him.

1578
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:31,420
The one who has the
guts is Bajirao Singham.

1579
01:35:39,232 --> 01:35:39,857
Hello.

1580
01:35:39,966 --> 01:35:41,593
Where are you?
- ECR road.

1581
01:35:42,369 --> 01:35:43,358
Barricade. High alert.

1582
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:44,161
And you?

1583
01:35:44,304 --> 01:35:45,931
I am going to the temple
with the entire family.

1584
01:35:46,273 --> 01:35:47,968
Why?
- I knew you will forget.

1585
01:35:48,175 --> 01:35:49,437
Today is my birthday, Singham.

1586
01:35:52,245 --> 01:35:53,872
I didn't forget..
I just didn't remember.

1587
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:55,207
Happy birthday, Kavya.

1588
01:35:55,382 --> 01:35:56,110
Not this way.

1589
01:35:56,383 --> 01:35:57,611
You will have to come
home in the evening..

1590
01:35:57,884 --> 01:35:59,408
..and wish me after cutting the cake.

1591
01:35:59,619 --> 01:36:01,450
But your Gotya will be there.

1592
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:03,583
You are such a brave
officer and scared of Gotya.

1593
01:36:03,657 --> 01:36:05,318
I see. Aren't you scared?

1594
01:36:05,525 --> 01:36:07,152
If you are brave then
come here with Gotya.

1595
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:08,587
Challenging me?

1596
01:36:08,962 --> 01:36:10,520
Sir, just a minute.

1597
01:36:11,164 --> 01:36:13,257
Just a minute, I will call you later.
- Okay.

1598
01:36:13,533 --> 01:36:15,000
Kavya, let's go.
- Yes.

1599
01:36:15,268 --> 01:36:16,292
Father.
- Yes.

1600
01:36:16,369 --> 01:36:17,927
There will be traffic on Mount Rd.

1601
01:36:18,004 --> 01:36:18,993
Let's take the ECR road.

1602
01:36:19,206 --> 01:36:20,298
We will get to the temple quickly.

1603
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:22,032
Very good, very good.

1604
01:36:26,279 --> 01:36:27,576
RC book and license please.

1605
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,957
Yes, Kavya. - Singham, you look
dashing in black shirt and jeans.

1606
01:36:43,263 --> 01:36:45,356
See, I met your challenge.

1607
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:46,296
Now it's your turn.

1608
01:36:46,466 --> 01:36:48,263
My home in the evening, birthday.

1609
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:49,267
Better be there.
- Okay.

1610
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:52,529
Sir, he has the RC
book but no license.

1611
01:36:53,206 --> 01:36:55,606
Let him go, I know them.
- No, no. No way.

1612
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:57,000
You want the license, don't you?

1613
01:36:57,077 --> 01:36:57,975
I will just get it sent

1614
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,510
Kavya, give me the phone.
- One minute.

1615
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:04,144
Hello, Singham, how are you?
- Fine, aunty.

1616
01:37:04,217 --> 01:37:08,347
Do come see us when
your family comes here?

1617
01:37:08,555 --> 01:37:12,047
Who are you talking to?
- To relatives.

1618
01:37:12,659 --> 01:37:14,149
I am sweating in this heat..

1619
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:16,229
..and you are talking to
your relatives in this AC.

1620
01:37:16,296 --> 01:37:17,285
You come inside as well.

1621
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:18,558
Come and talk to them.

1622
01:37:19,966 --> 01:37:21,433
Hello! What happened?

1623
01:37:22,235 --> 01:37:23,463
Okay. Send it.

1624
01:37:24,271 --> 01:37:27,069
So long to bring the license.
- Sorry, sir.

1625
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:29,509
Here.

1626
01:37:30,443 --> 01:37:32,138
I don want anyone's favor.

1627
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:34,310
I have given them my license.

1628
01:37:35,048 --> 01:37:35,980
Sir.

1629
01:37:39,052 --> 01:37:40,280
Let them go.

1630
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,225
Kavya, where is Anjali?

1631
01:37:49,362 --> 01:37:50,522
She has gone to the
mall to get a gift for me.

1632
01:37:50,564 --> 01:37:51,462
She will be back soon, mother.

1633
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:54,525
What is it, Singham?

1634
01:37:55,235 --> 01:37:56,327
I have met my challenge.

1635
01:37:56,403 --> 01:37:58,894
Won't you fuIfill your challenge?
- I will.

1636
01:37:59,005 --> 01:38:01,200
But you are looking
great in that purple dress.

1637
01:38:03,176 --> 01:38:04,438
Singham.

1638
01:38:05,145 --> 01:38:07,375
Son. You here?

1639
01:38:07,581 --> 01:38:09,606
Nice of you to come.
- Hello.

1640
01:38:10,383 --> 01:38:13,443
Who are you here to see?
- You.

1641
01:38:13,954 --> 01:38:14,921
Why me?

1642
01:38:15,622 --> 01:38:16,953
I cannot say it like this.

1643
01:38:17,457 --> 01:38:18,424
lt's the question of your respect.

1644
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:19,516
How do you drive the car?

1645
01:38:19,926 --> 01:38:20,915
Do you know it has expired?

1646
01:38:21,161 --> 01:38:24,255
Oh no, did you bump
someone with the car?

1647
01:38:24,464 --> 01:38:26,557
No, no, his license
expired three months ago.

1648
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:28,093
There is a penalty for that.

1649
01:38:28,168 --> 01:38:29,499
6 months and Rs.5000 fine.

1650
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:31,603
What? - Thankfully you
are from my village.

1651
01:38:32,505 --> 01:38:34,496
Come to the RTO office
with the license on Monday.

1652
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:37,136
And a passport size
photo with a smile.

1653
01:38:38,111 --> 01:38:39,544
How nice of Singham,
isn't it, father?

1654
01:38:41,214 --> 01:38:44,581
Son, now that you are here,
cut the cake with us.

1655
01:38:44,951 --> 01:38:46,009
Anjali will be here soon.

1656
01:38:46,086 --> 01:38:47,485
And Gotya won't say anything either.

1657
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:49,419
No one will say anything.

1658
01:38:49,456 --> 01:38:50,423
Come, come.

1659
01:38:52,025 --> 01:38:54,892
Yes, Tavde.
- No Tavde. Terror.

1660
01:38:56,062 --> 01:38:58,860
And I have a mother but no daughter.

1661
01:38:59,432 --> 01:39:03,027
That's why I kidnapped
your daughter Anjali. - What?

1662
01:39:04,471 --> 01:39:05,438
Scared.

1663
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:09,099
My man called you so
many times for money.

1664
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:11,368
What did you think?

1665
01:39:11,578 --> 01:39:12,943
Someone's selling you..

1666
01:39:13,046 --> 01:39:14,445
..three nights and four days
holiday package on the phone?

1667
01:39:14,481 --> 01:39:15,539
Anjali is with you?

1668
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:17,583
Yes I have captured her.

1669
01:39:18,251 --> 01:39:20,151
And I know your next
dialogue as well.

1670
01:39:20,587 --> 01:39:21,611
Give the phone to my daughter.

1671
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:22,954
I want to hear her voice.

1672
01:39:23,056 --> 01:39:26,253
''Papa, these people
are very dangerous.''

1673
01:39:26,326 --> 01:39:27,452
''They will kill me.''

1674
01:39:27,527 --> 01:39:30,155
And you will say,
don't harm my daughter.

1675
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:31,993
I will give you the money.
Then get it.

1676
01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:34,463
Deliver the money to
Centre One Mall's parking area..

1677
01:39:34,534 --> 01:39:35,466
..and take your daughter.

1678
01:39:35,535 --> 01:39:40,472
And listen..don't inform your
other daughter's boyfriend Singham.

1679
01:39:41,107 --> 01:39:43,974
Inform him after the deal is done.

1680
01:39:45,111 --> 01:39:46,840
You are ruined, Gotya.

1681
01:39:46,913 --> 01:39:48,073
Hello, hello.

1682
01:39:53,887 --> 01:39:55,149
What happened?
- Nothing.

1683
01:39:55,355 --> 01:39:56,287
Whose call was it?

1684
01:39:58,058 --> 01:39:58,888
Where is Anjali?

1685
01:39:59,025 --> 01:40:00,959
Nothing is wrong with Anjali.
I will be right back.

1686
01:40:01,027 --> 01:40:02,289
What is wrong with Anjali?
- Where are you going?

1687
01:40:02,395 --> 01:40:04,329
What happened?
- I said nothing is wrong.

1688
01:40:04,397 --> 01:40:06,262
What..
- I don't want the police's help.

1689
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:07,425
I will be right back.

1690
01:40:07,968 --> 01:40:09,868
Until you don't tell me,
I won't let you go..

1691
01:40:09,936 --> 01:40:11,198
..nor will I leave.

1692
01:40:14,441 --> 01:40:15,635
Don't worry.

1693
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:19,168
Anjali will come back to you.

1694
01:40:21,214 --> 01:40:22,943
And the police will
take action after that.

1695
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,665
Sir, Mr. Gautam.

1696
01:40:47,107 --> 01:40:48,904
We are coming. Open the car's boot.

1697
01:41:08,595 --> 01:41:09,926
No one got down from it.

1698
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:11,162
lt's their car.

1699
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:22,064
Sir, the bag has been collected.

1700
01:41:23,043 --> 01:41:24,135
The money isn't important.

1701
01:41:24,411 --> 01:41:25,969
The girl's safety is.

1702
01:41:35,889 --> 01:41:36,378
Sir, shall we go?

1703
01:41:36,456 --> 01:41:38,083
Let the girl reach the car first.

1704
01:41:42,962 --> 01:41:44,224
Father.
- Dear.

1705
01:42:35,515 --> 01:42:37,278
''Singham.''

1706
01:43:14,954 --> 01:43:18,253
Trying to fool the police.

1707
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:19,120
I will..

1708
01:43:25,098 --> 01:43:26,429
Jadoo from 'Koi Mil Gaya'.

1709
01:43:26,466 --> 01:43:27,490
Which language are you speaking in?

1710
01:43:27,567 --> 01:43:29,159
Sir, it's Tulu language
from Karnataka. I know it.

1711
01:43:40,647 --> 01:43:43,241
You ask for milk and
not money to do this job.

1712
01:43:43,316 --> 01:43:44,908
He means money.

1713
01:43:45,151 --> 01:43:46,277
They do this job for money.

1714
01:43:46,352 --> 01:43:47,319
All the instructions
are given on phone.

1715
01:43:47,387 --> 01:43:48,376
They just do their job and leave.

1716
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:00,923
Hail Lord Ganesha.

1717
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,934
Sir, if he speaks
like this in the court..

1718
01:44:03,002 --> 01:44:06,460
..then the judge will
file a case against us.

1719
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:08,032
Find out is he telling the truth.

1720
01:44:10,243 --> 01:44:11,301
Hello, inspector Hegde?

1721
01:44:14,414 --> 01:44:15,608
Raghu Kotian.

1722
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:19,950
Address: 32, North Angle.

1723
01:44:20,119 --> 01:44:21,086
Trikuti.

1724
01:44:23,256 --> 01:44:25,053
Does Raghu Kotiyan live here?

1725
01:44:25,124 --> 01:44:26,352
Yes he does.

1726
01:44:26,559 --> 01:44:27,890
Sir, information correct.

1727
01:44:31,197 --> 01:44:32,186
He is right, sir.

1728
01:44:32,265 --> 01:44:33,994
He is speaking Tulu
because he is from Yellapur.

1729
01:44:34,234 --> 01:44:35,394
What to do, sir?

1730
01:44:36,002 --> 01:44:38,197
We got the girl, but lost the money.

1731
01:44:38,538 --> 01:44:41,098
And, sir, this man is of no use.

1732
01:44:41,174 --> 01:44:42,971
No matter where you
release a pet dog..

1733
01:44:43,042 --> 01:44:44,509
..he always returns home.

1734
01:44:44,811 --> 01:44:46,108
I see.

1735
01:44:46,312 --> 01:44:47,836
I don't know.

1736
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,814
Because I don't have a dog.

1737
01:44:51,384 --> 01:44:52,976
But he is a dog.

1738
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:59,289
And to send this dog
back home to his owner..

1739
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:02,559
I will have to use
the ways of my village

1740
01:45:03,062 --> 01:45:05,860
Brother. Brother.

1741
01:45:07,533 --> 01:45:10,001
Sir, sir.

1742
01:45:10,069 --> 01:45:11,161
Raghu.

1743
01:45:12,105 --> 01:45:14,039
Jail-break. Escape.

1744
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:17,306
Did you tell anyone anything?
- No, sir.

1745
01:45:21,147 --> 01:45:22,136
Yes, Shiva.

1746
01:45:22,215 --> 01:45:25,116
Raghu has escaped from
jail and come to us.

1747
01:45:27,453 --> 01:45:29,853
He hasn't said anything..

1748
01:45:32,258 --> 01:45:33,418
O God!

1749
01:45:44,003 --> 01:45:45,368
Jaikant Shikre.

1750
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:50,066
Raghu's statement would
have led me only to Shiva.

1751
01:45:51,311 --> 01:45:54,872
But the statement
that he works for you..

1752
01:45:55,448 --> 01:45:59,612
..will help Bajirao Singham
tighten the noose around you.

1753
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:06,082
Very well done.

1754
01:46:06,559 --> 01:46:08,459
That's called doing your duty.

1755
01:46:08,528 --> 01:46:11,326
You are not just good..
but the goodest.

1756
01:46:11,597 --> 01:46:12,894
And you, Bajirao.

1757
01:46:13,066 --> 01:46:14,658
You have become more famous..

1758
01:46:14,967 --> 01:46:17,629
..than Goa's fenny, Goa's cashews.

1759
01:46:18,004 --> 01:46:21,064
Without support, you
have done such good work..

1760
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:24,007
..that I am ready to support you.

1761
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:29,239
From today I make you
our police department's..

1762
01:46:29,315 --> 01:46:30,646
..training chief.

1763
01:46:31,517 --> 01:46:34,486
Now train the new recruits.

1764
01:46:35,388 --> 01:46:37,618
These petty cases like kidnapping,
etcetera..

1765
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:39,624
..will be handled by DSP Patkar.

1766
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:40,488
Happy?

1767
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:42,493
Why don't you directly say that..

1768
01:46:43,329 --> 01:46:46,492
..you want to remove me from
this case and save Jaikant?

1769
01:46:47,266 --> 01:46:49,564
What are you saying?

1770
01:46:51,437 --> 01:46:52,904
Do you know who Jaikant is?

1771
01:46:52,972 --> 01:46:53,870
Do you know who he is?

1772
01:46:54,073 --> 01:46:55,267
He is an elephant.

1773
01:46:55,541 --> 01:46:57,873
You are not even an
ant compared to him.

1774
01:46:57,944 --> 01:46:58,911
Not even an ant.

1775
01:46:58,978 --> 01:47:01,208
When an ant enters
the elephant's ears..

1776
01:47:02,215 --> 01:47:04,308
..then it can make him dance.

1777
01:47:04,384 --> 01:47:05,248
How will you do it?

1778
01:47:05,885 --> 01:47:07,045
How will you do it?

1779
01:47:07,286 --> 01:47:09,277
How many times have
I explained to you..

1780
01:47:09,489 --> 01:47:12,287
..that you don't have any
evidence against Jaikant?

1781
01:47:12,358 --> 01:47:13,416
What evidence do you have?

1782
01:47:13,559 --> 01:47:15,527
Tell me. What do you have?

1783
01:47:23,202 --> 01:47:24,328
What evidence does your father have..

1784
01:47:24,404 --> 01:47:25,462
..that you are his son?

1785
01:47:25,538 --> 01:47:26,664
Look..

1786
01:47:26,939 --> 01:47:29,464
If there's no evidence, then
every culprit is innocent?

1787
01:47:29,542 --> 01:47:31,203
He is hitting me!

1788
01:47:31,277 --> 01:47:33,939
If there's no evidence, then
we are the minister's slave?

1789
01:47:36,516 --> 01:47:38,177
You hit me?

1790
01:47:38,284 --> 01:47:40,479
You hit me, the minister?

1791
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:43,088
What evidence do you have?
- Them.

1792
01:47:43,156 --> 01:47:44,088
They saw it.

1793
01:47:44,157 --> 01:47:45,954
You saw what he did.

1794
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:48,423
What happened, sir?
- Singham hit me.

1795
01:47:48,494 --> 01:47:50,325
Why are you joking, sir?

1796
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:52,521
Singham sir is standing
in his place.

1797
01:47:53,266 --> 01:47:55,234
He didn't even touch you.

1798
01:47:55,368 --> 01:47:56,562
You are all lying.

1799
01:47:56,636 --> 01:47:57,864
You are all in this together.

1800
01:47:58,004 --> 01:48:00,029
Just because you are
Bajirao doesn't mean anything.

1801
01:48:00,139 --> 01:48:01,163
You think you are a brave Maratha..

1802
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,332
..just because your name is Bajirao.

1803
01:48:02,408 --> 01:48:04,968
But I will show you
the power of my chair.

1804
01:48:05,044 --> 01:48:07,308
I will show all of you
the power of this chair.

1805
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:09,245
You brag a lot about
your chair, don't you?

1806
01:48:10,049 --> 01:48:11,880
This time we will hit you
in a place..

1807
01:48:11,951 --> 01:48:14,511
..where you will remember us
each time you sit in a chair.

1808
01:48:14,887 --> 01:48:16,445
Meaning?
- The lion's paw.

1809
01:48:19,525 --> 01:48:20,549
What the..

1810
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:21,627
Come on.

1811
01:48:42,048 --> 01:48:43,276
Oh!

1812
01:48:48,988 --> 01:48:50,012
Sir.

1813
01:48:50,556 --> 01:48:53,116
I have six months to retirement.

1814
01:48:53,326 --> 01:48:54,384
Can I hit once as well?

1815
01:48:57,430 --> 01:48:58,556
Go ahead.

1816
01:49:26,225 --> 01:49:27,487
Singham, come home quickly.

1817
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:28,892
Why? What happened?

1818
01:49:29,028 --> 01:49:30,552
I cannot say it on the phone.
Just come fast.

1819
01:49:35,535 --> 01:49:36,900
Singham, come inside.

1820
01:49:36,969 --> 01:49:38,129
You are not going to
believe what happened.

1821
01:49:43,309 --> 01:49:44,503
No. It's alright.

1822
01:49:53,219 --> 01:49:53,878
What happened?

1823
01:49:54,086 --> 01:49:57,021
Gautam called us all here.

1824
01:49:57,356 --> 01:49:59,381
To talk about your marriage.

1825
01:50:02,261 --> 01:50:05,162
Not Gautam, Manya. Gotya.

1826
01:50:06,599 --> 01:50:07,623
Singham.

1827
01:50:11,437 --> 01:50:13,598
I couldn't understand as Gautam.

1828
01:50:13,873 --> 01:50:17,206
But today, as Gotya,
I understood one thing.

1829
01:50:17,276 --> 01:50:20,268
People in the city
are reduced to dirt.

1830
01:50:21,314 --> 01:50:23,475
But every person close
to his village soil..

1831
01:50:24,450 --> 01:50:28,250
..stays linked to
his culture and values.

1832
01:50:28,554 --> 01:50:30,920
That's why I called Manya.

1833
01:50:31,557 --> 01:50:34,355
Because there can't be
anyone better for Kavya..

1834
01:50:38,064 --> 01:50:42,467
But Kavya doesn't look
happy with this relation.

1835
01:50:42,902 --> 01:50:44,426
No, father, I was always ready.

1836
01:51:08,361 --> 01:51:13,458
''The earth and the sky
exist because of our love.''

1837
01:51:13,633 --> 01:51:18,593
''Night turns to day
because of our love.''

1838
01:51:19,038 --> 01:51:24,101
''lt's raining happiness.''

1839
01:51:24,343 --> 01:51:29,246
''All my dreams
fuIfilled because of our love.''

1840
01:51:29,649 --> 01:51:35,019
''You are my God,
don't ever leave me.''

1841
01:51:35,221 --> 01:51:39,658
''Bless me with this grace
and bring peace to my heart.''

1842
01:51:40,026 --> 01:51:45,396
''O, Lord. I am grateful to You''

1843
01:51:45,431 --> 01:51:49,128
''My love has appeared before me.''

1844
01:51:50,403 --> 01:51:56,239
''O, Lord. I am grateful to You.''

1845
01:51:56,308 --> 01:52:00,369
''My love has appeared before me.''

1846
01:52:27,173 --> 01:52:33,442
''I bow to you in reverence.''

1847
01:52:33,612 --> 01:52:38,606
''I will lose myseIf in your arms.''

1848
01:52:39,151 --> 01:52:44,179
''You are my sun and shade,
my destiny.''

1849
01:52:44,356 --> 01:52:48,952
''I am no longer scared as
now that you are with me.''

1850
01:52:49,028 --> 01:52:54,193
''Now all your sorrows are mine.''

1851
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:59,929
''All my joys are yours.''

1852
01:53:00,406 --> 01:53:05,400
''You are my love,
don't ever leave me.''

1853
01:53:05,878 --> 01:53:10,406
''Bless me with this
grace and gratify my heart.''

1854
01:53:10,449 --> 01:53:16,046
''Oh, Lord. I am
grateful to You, Lord.''

1855
01:53:16,155 --> 01:53:20,251
''My love is before me.''

1856
01:53:20,326 --> 01:53:26,595
''Oh, Lord. I am
grateful to You, Lord.''

1857
01:53:26,866 --> 01:53:31,064
''My love has appeared before me.''

1858
01:53:53,058 --> 01:53:53,888
Sir.

1859
01:53:54,193 --> 01:53:57,162
What is this?
- These are Jaikant's party workers.

1860
01:53:57,830 --> 01:53:59,263
He has won the election.

1861
01:53:59,431 --> 01:54:01,365
He is inside. He wants to meet you.

1862
01:54:04,603 --> 01:54:06,127
Come in, inspector.

1863
01:54:06,472 --> 01:54:07,996
I won in the election.

1864
01:54:08,307 --> 01:54:09,365
The party is celebrating.

1865
01:54:09,408 --> 01:54:10,340
Party time.

1866
01:54:10,843 --> 01:54:12,572
Yet I had some
important work with you.

1867
01:54:13,345 --> 01:54:16,246
I had to handover a few
important papers..personally.

1868
01:54:16,415 --> 01:54:18,349
Shikre courier service.

1869
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:22,887
Transfer orders.

1870
01:54:23,856 --> 01:54:30,159
In 24 hours, you will be transferred
from this police station.

1871
01:54:30,529 --> 01:54:32,429
What will you say when
you go to Shivgad now?

1872
01:54:34,166 --> 01:54:36,430
Jaikant got me
transferred out of fear.

1873
01:54:37,069 --> 01:54:40,061
You will have to travel 300
kilometers to give this news.

1874
01:54:40,472 --> 01:54:42,872
And these days,
traveling by road isn't safe.

1875
01:54:43,175 --> 01:54:46,235
Hit and run. Accidents.

1876
01:54:47,046 --> 01:54:51,278
Where will you be
before delivering this news?

1877
01:54:52,284 --> 01:54:53,273
Who knows?

1878
01:54:55,888 --> 01:54:56,820
You gave me a look?

1879
01:54:58,390 --> 01:54:59,857
Wounded lion.

1880
01:55:01,193 --> 01:55:02,125
Go ahead.

1881
01:55:02,428 --> 01:55:05,158
There are just 1400
tigers left in India.

1882
01:55:05,431 --> 01:55:06,898
You can be one for a day as well.

1883
01:55:07,132 --> 01:55:08,963
But remember one thing.

1884
01:55:11,237 --> 01:55:13,831
If you are Bajirao Singham
the lion..

1885
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:16,601
..then I am Jaikant Shikre
the hunter.

1886
01:55:18,110 --> 01:55:21,546
How a minister hunts
down a police officer.

1887
01:55:22,081 --> 01:55:22,911
Have a look.

1888
01:55:23,916 --> 01:55:26,384
Jaikant the hunter.

1889
01:55:28,354 --> 01:55:29,844
Hail.

1890
01:55:33,192 --> 01:55:34,420
Sir, Shiva has given a statement..

1891
01:55:34,493 --> 01:55:36,051
..that he used to run
all the illegal businesses.

1892
01:55:37,196 --> 01:55:40,063
Now Jaikant..
- No one can touch him.

1893
01:55:46,038 --> 01:55:47,062
Open the lockup.

1894
01:55:47,473 --> 01:55:48,371
Yes sir.

1895
01:56:03,555 --> 01:56:05,546
O God!

1896
01:56:06,425 --> 01:56:07,619
You run the racket?

1897
01:56:08,394 --> 01:56:10,021
You will save Jaikant?

1898
01:56:13,265 --> 01:56:14,994
Hit me.

1899
01:56:16,035 --> 01:56:17,662
How long can you hit me?

1900
01:56:18,103 --> 01:56:20,435
You have only 24 hours.

1901
01:56:20,472 --> 01:56:22,303
You cannot do anything.

1902
01:56:27,346 --> 01:56:28,438
Hit me.

1903
01:56:29,581 --> 01:56:33,415
You are hitting me but
you are feeling the pain.

1904
01:56:33,485 --> 01:56:36,010
You humiliated me in
this police station..

1905
01:56:36,121 --> 01:56:38,146
..in front of a tea-vendor.

1906
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:41,423
But what stature do the police have?

1907
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:42,392
Hit me.

1908
01:56:42,594 --> 01:56:43,583
Hit me.

1909
01:56:44,596 --> 01:56:46,860
O God!

1910
01:56:49,902 --> 01:56:51,130
Singham.

1911
01:56:52,871 --> 01:56:56,034
You knew Jaikant Shikre is a goon.

1912
01:56:56,442 --> 01:56:58,137
What could you do?

1913
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:03,905
He joined politics.

1914
01:57:04,149 --> 01:57:05,377
Won the elections.

1915
01:57:05,484 --> 01:57:06,951
What could you do?

1916
01:57:09,888 --> 01:57:10,946
Look, Singham.

1917
01:57:11,023 --> 01:57:15,187
Today a goon handed
you your transfer order..

1918
01:57:15,294 --> 01:57:16,955
..in the police station.

1919
01:57:17,162 --> 01:57:18,959
What did you do?

1920
01:57:21,667 --> 01:57:24,158
Tomorrow Jaikant will swear-in..

1921
01:57:24,236 --> 01:57:29,469
..and then you will
salute him like this.

1922
01:57:29,541 --> 01:57:32,567
That is your stature.

1923
01:57:34,013 --> 01:57:38,382
And the minister
Jaikant will make a call.

1924
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:41,578
And you will set me free in two days.

1925
01:57:42,554 --> 01:57:44,021
Hey, I forgot it.

1926
01:57:44,223 --> 01:57:46,487
But you got transferred, Singham.

1927
01:57:46,625 --> 01:57:49,116
Hit me.

1928
01:57:49,428 --> 01:57:50,952
Hit me.

1929
01:57:51,196 --> 01:57:53,892
This is what
policemen can do, Singham.

1930
01:57:54,233 --> 01:57:55,427
Hit me.

1931
01:58:30,536 --> 01:58:32,163
Shiva is right, sir.

1932
01:58:34,139 --> 01:58:35,504
What stature do we have?

1933
01:58:36,442 --> 01:58:37,602
Nothing.

1934
01:58:38,944 --> 01:58:42,004
We protect the city day and night.

1935
01:58:42,581 --> 01:58:47,245
But our salary is less
than a corporate sweeper's.

1936
01:58:48,921 --> 01:58:53,381
We live in homes the size
of people's kitchens, sir.

1937
01:58:53,425 --> 01:58:54,858
That is our stature.

1938
01:58:54,927 --> 01:58:56,121
That is our stature.

1939
01:58:57,896 --> 01:59:00,865
People celebrate.

1940
01:59:01,366 --> 01:59:03,334
After 'Holi' comes 'Janmashtami'.

1941
01:59:03,602 --> 01:59:05,968
After 'Ramzan' comes 'Navratri'.

1942
01:59:06,105 --> 01:59:08,164
After 'Eid' comes 'Diwali'.

1943
01:59:08,373 --> 01:59:12,070
But the duty of a police
officer is never over.

1944
01:59:13,412 --> 01:59:15,141
We never get a
holiday on any festival.

1945
01:59:15,214 --> 01:59:16,613
Just stand guard.

1946
01:59:17,049 --> 01:59:18,311
Stand guard as security.

1947
01:59:22,921 --> 01:59:25,549
We don't have the right
to celebrate any festival.

1948
01:59:27,392 --> 01:59:29,326
Because police
officials don't have a stature.

1949
01:59:31,396 --> 01:59:33,193
We don't realize when
our children grow up.

1950
01:59:35,167 --> 01:59:37,362
Try to save others during riots.

1951
01:59:38,270 --> 01:59:42,001
But you don't know whether
your family is alive or not.

1952
01:59:44,209 --> 01:59:46,404
And then a police
officer like you comes along.

1953
01:59:47,212 --> 01:59:48,509
He tries to shake the entire system..

1954
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:50,309
..but what
difference did it make, sir?

1955
01:59:50,516 --> 01:59:51,448
What good did it do?

1956
01:59:52,584 --> 01:59:56,452
Honest police officers only
get transfer orders for rewards.

1957
01:59:57,523 --> 02:00:00,287
And people like inspector Kadam..

1958
02:00:00,959 --> 02:00:02,153
..don't get rewards.

1959
02:00:02,561 --> 02:00:07,157
Instead, they get a bullet
from a powerful man like Jaikant.

1960
02:00:07,466 --> 02:00:09,400
One bullet.

1961
02:00:13,138 --> 02:00:13,968
lt's of no use, sir.

1962
02:00:14,039 --> 02:00:14,903
No use.

1963
02:00:17,276 --> 02:00:20,177
Go, sir. Go back to your village.

1964
02:00:21,246 --> 02:00:22,611
It's of no use here.

1965
02:00:40,432 --> 02:00:42,400
Hello, uncle!
- Hello, dear! How are you?

1966
02:00:54,379 --> 02:00:55,937
That petty goon Shiva tells me..

1967
02:00:57,382 --> 02:01:00,112
..that we police
officers don't have any stature.

1968
02:01:01,553 --> 02:01:03,020
Why is that, sir?

1969
02:01:03,989 --> 02:01:07,254
That Jaikant hands me
my transfer orders..

1970
02:01:08,093 --> 02:01:09,890
..and I cannot do anything.

1971
02:01:11,964 --> 02:01:13,158
Why is that, sir?

1972
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:17,334
Why did Rakesh Kadam kill himseIf?

1973
02:01:18,403 --> 02:01:20,462
They still didn't get an answer.

1974
02:01:21,573 --> 02:01:22,437
Why is that, sir?

1975
02:01:22,474 --> 02:01:23,907
Hey, Singham.

1976
02:01:24,176 --> 02:01:25,074
What is it?

1977
02:01:25,377 --> 02:01:28,505
You know that Kadam was
accused of corruption.

1978
02:01:28,914 --> 02:01:29,938
What could we do?

1979
02:01:30,148 --> 02:01:32,241
What else can officers like you do?

1980
02:01:33,018 --> 02:01:35,350
Goons like Jaikant and
politicians like Narvekar..

1981
02:01:35,454 --> 02:01:36,478
Quiet!

1982
02:01:37,489 --> 02:01:38,888
He has gone mad, sir.

1983
02:01:39,391 --> 02:01:42,360
Just because he received his
transfer orders, he is frustrated.

1984
02:01:44,396 --> 02:01:47,263
Singham. We police
officers have to do our duty..

1985
02:01:47,332 --> 02:01:49,129
..restrained by certain limits.

1986
02:01:50,302 --> 02:01:52,202
No matter how many
questions you raise.

1987
02:01:52,971 --> 02:01:55,064
But we have to answer our superiors.

1988
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:58,202
But maybe you have forgotten that.

1989
02:01:58,410 --> 02:01:59,934
You have forgotten that..

1990
02:02:00,012 --> 02:02:01,502
..there is a lion's
emblem on our cap.

1991
02:02:02,247 --> 02:02:04,977
And it's not given to any politician,
even the chief minister.

1992
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:08,014
lt's not given to the country's
prime minister or the President.

1993
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:09,617
Only we are bestowed with it.

1994
02:02:10,088 --> 02:02:13,353
Because people believe
that we will protect them.

1995
02:02:15,394 --> 02:02:17,521
It's not that I didn't try.

1996
02:02:19,064 --> 02:02:20,861
I tried to change many things.

1997
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:23,993
But the system
controls the department..

1998
02:02:24,136 --> 02:02:25,501
..the department
doesn't control the system.

1999
02:02:26,405 --> 02:02:28,430
You think this system is right?

2000
02:02:29,207 --> 02:02:31,300
I am wrong,
inspector Kadam was wrong.

2001
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:34,075
But you are the DGP of this city.

2002
02:02:34,613 --> 02:02:38,572
Look into this boy's eyes and
say that his father was wrong.

2003
02:02:42,087 --> 02:02:45,215
You. Look into your wife's eyes..

2004
02:02:45,524 --> 02:02:47,890
..and say that Jaikant is
a decent and honest man.

2005
02:02:49,328 --> 02:02:50,818
And you look into
your children's eyes..

2006
02:02:50,896 --> 02:02:52,193
..and say that I am wrong.

2007
02:02:55,100 --> 02:02:59,161
Mrs. Patkar, look
into my eyes and say..

2008
02:02:59,905 --> 02:03:01,031
..that your husband is right.

2009
02:03:08,046 --> 02:03:09,536
You talk about the system.

2010
02:03:10,282 --> 02:03:13,115
If we want, then no
one can even steal..

2011
02:03:13,185 --> 02:03:15,949
..slippers from the temple.

2012
02:03:18,357 --> 02:03:21,053
Sir, there are some officers here..

2013
02:03:21,126 --> 02:03:24,027
..who are doing their duty honestly.

2014
02:03:24,496 --> 02:03:27,158
But our own department is
trying to hunt them down.

2015
02:03:30,936 --> 02:03:33,097
Knowing what is wrong
doesn't make a difference.

2016
02:03:34,172 --> 02:03:36,072
What makes a
difference is making it right.

2017
02:03:37,576 --> 02:03:39,874
I have 11 hours left for my transfer.

2018
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:43,814
I am going to fight
against Jaikant..alone.

2019
02:03:46,051 --> 02:03:49,384
You..can stand here
with your eyes lowered.

2020
02:03:50,288 --> 02:03:52,085
But I will surely
return to my village..

2021
02:03:52,157 --> 02:03:53,954
..and look into my
father's eyes and say..

2022
02:03:54,359 --> 02:03:56,293
..that I did a man's job.

2023
02:03:58,864 --> 02:03:59,956
And alone.

2024
02:04:36,568 --> 02:04:38,433
Kavya, you don't understand.

2025
02:04:39,504 --> 02:04:40,630
Leave me and go away.

2026
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:42,338
After what I am going to do..

2027
02:04:42,407 --> 02:04:43,897
..my own department will kill me.

2028
02:04:46,845 --> 02:04:48,574
I stopped you from
leaving the other day.

2029
02:04:52,284 --> 02:04:54,377
So how can I leave you now?

2030
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:56,452
Sir.

2031
02:05:02,928 --> 02:05:05,453
We three have decided
to resign from our jobs.

2032
02:05:06,164 --> 02:05:10,362
Sir, we never did our duty as
long as we were police officers.

2033
02:05:12,003 --> 02:05:13,402
Today we no longer have our jobs..

2034
02:05:14,439 --> 02:05:17,431
..but we want to do a
policeman's job with you today.

2035
02:05:18,610 --> 02:05:20,202
Sir, whether anyone
supports you or not.

2036
02:05:21,079 --> 02:05:22,569
But we will surely support you.

2037
02:05:57,649 --> 02:06:01,449
I looked into the eyes of that
five year old boy's eyes and said..

2038
02:06:01,653 --> 02:06:05,020
..that his father was right
and Jaikant Shikre was wrong.

2039
02:06:05,390 --> 02:06:08,587
I, Vikram Pawar, as
the DGP of this city..

2040
02:06:08,994 --> 02:06:11,963
..will ensure justice
to inspector Kadam..

2041
02:06:13,031 --> 02:06:14,965
..and punishment for Jaikant.

2042
02:06:15,233 --> 02:06:16,495
For the next 24 hours..

2043
02:06:16,902 --> 02:06:21,066
..the police department won't
work for any VlP, politician..

2044
02:06:21,139 --> 02:06:22,367
..or bureaucrat.

2045
02:06:22,541 --> 02:06:25,510
The department will do
what it feels is right.

2046
02:06:25,944 --> 02:06:26,933
Sir.

2047
02:06:27,245 --> 02:06:30,271
I swear, Jaikant
won't swear-in tomorrow.

2048
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:07,880
Hail Jaikant Shikre.

2049
02:07:11,489 --> 02:07:12,421
Jaikant.

2050
02:07:12,991 --> 02:07:14,015
Jaikant.

2051
02:07:16,528 --> 02:07:17,426
How did you come in?

2052
02:07:18,897 --> 02:07:19,921
What are you doing at this hour?

2053
02:07:20,165 --> 02:07:21,530
What do you mean at this hour?

2054
02:07:21,933 --> 02:07:25,460
That madman Singham is
planning to kill you.

2055
02:07:26,972 --> 02:07:28,064
So let him come.

2056
02:07:28,139 --> 02:07:30,232
What do you mean ''Let him come''?

2057
02:07:30,408 --> 02:07:32,342
That's not how its done, Jaikant.

2058
02:07:32,410 --> 02:07:35,038
If anything goes wrong
before the swear-in.

2059
02:07:35,113 --> 02:07:36,341
Over.

2060
02:07:36,414 --> 02:07:38,075
Oh, God.

2061
02:07:38,149 --> 02:07:41,209
News, media, public everyone..

2062
02:07:43,021 --> 02:07:45,512
I suggest that you come with me.

2063
02:07:45,624 --> 02:07:47,425
I will take you to a very safe place.

2064
02:07:47,425 --> 02:07:48,357
Come, come with me.

2065
02:07:48,393 --> 02:07:49,951
Don't think. Come on.

2066
02:07:50,128 --> 02:07:51,026
Let's go.

2067
02:07:52,397 --> 02:07:53,921
Where do we have to go?

2068
02:08:01,272 --> 02:08:04,298
DSP. Have you lost your mind?

2069
02:08:04,976 --> 02:08:07,604
So many police
officials for one Singham.

2070
02:08:08,046 --> 02:08:11,209
Singham is coming to kill Jaikant..

2071
02:08:11,282 --> 02:08:13,443
..and not Rajnikant the superstar.

2072
02:08:16,021 --> 02:08:17,283
DGP sir.

2073
02:08:17,922 --> 02:08:18,479
You are here too.

2074
02:08:18,957 --> 02:08:20,424
Guest is God.

2075
02:08:20,458 --> 02:08:22,585
Great, great.

2076
02:08:23,161 --> 02:08:25,391
Such power before
I become the minister.

2077
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:29,525
DSP arrange for snacks
for the guests.

2078
02:08:29,601 --> 02:08:31,125
And let him come now.

2079
02:08:31,569 --> 02:08:34,629
Call that scoundrel now.

2080
02:08:35,073 --> 02:08:36,040
I will call him.

2081
02:08:36,441 --> 02:08:37,408
Singham.

2082
02:09:08,273 --> 02:09:12,039
Elders have said police are
neither good friends nor enemies.

2083
02:09:13,611 --> 02:09:15,238
You made both.

2084
02:09:15,947 --> 02:09:18,040
You befriended him and
locked horns with me.

2085
02:09:18,183 --> 02:09:22,142
You rascal DSP..
- What can I do, Jaikant?

2086
02:09:22,887 --> 02:09:24,548
No matter how much a
person wanders around..

2087
02:09:24,622 --> 02:09:25,987
..he does return home.

2088
02:09:26,124 --> 02:09:27,489
And I am a police official
after all.

2089
02:09:28,026 --> 02:09:29,516
I will support the
police officials in the end.

2090
02:09:29,594 --> 02:09:31,528
Go ahead promote your brotherhood.

2091
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:34,296
Let's all sing together.

2092
02:09:34,365 --> 02:09:36,595
Nothing.

2093
02:09:37,068 --> 02:09:39,093
You cannot harm me.

2094
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:40,635
I will swear-in tomorrow.

2095
02:09:40,905 --> 02:09:44,272
I will be minister
Sri Jaikant Shikre.

2096
02:09:44,909 --> 02:09:50,905
And since 1947 till 2011 you
can see the history of politics.

2097
02:09:51,116 --> 02:09:54,279
No minister in India
has ever been punished.

2098
02:09:54,419 --> 02:09:58,253
But that will be tomorrow, Jaikant.

2099
02:09:58,323 --> 02:10:00,883
And tonight you are in our grip.
- What do you mean?

2100
02:10:01,292 --> 02:10:03,226
We will have to clean you up.

2101
02:10:03,428 --> 02:10:07,990
But, sir, we will
have to do it right now.

2102
02:10:08,133 --> 02:10:09,157
What will you do?

2103
02:10:09,467 --> 02:10:11,025
What can you all do?

2104
02:10:11,369 --> 02:10:12,927
Phadnis.
- Yes, sir.

2105
02:10:13,304 --> 02:10:16,239
Let's kill him and declare suicide.
- Yes.

2106
02:10:16,307 --> 02:10:17,433
What yes?

2107
02:10:18,042 --> 02:10:19,100
Am I blind?

2108
02:10:19,344 --> 02:10:20,868
Is it a holiday
which you will declare?

2109
02:10:21,179 --> 02:10:22,476
DGP.

2110
02:10:22,981 --> 02:10:24,448
What are they blabbering?

2111
02:10:24,549 --> 02:10:25,573
They will kill me.

2112
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:27,481
Explain to them, DGP.

2113
02:10:31,256 --> 02:10:32,450
Where is the DGP?

2114
02:10:34,259 --> 02:10:38,127
The poor DGP is tired
of your election duty.

2115
02:10:39,130 --> 02:10:40,495
He has got high blood pressure.

2116
02:10:41,466 --> 02:10:44,594
The doctor has given him sedatives.

2117
02:10:45,970 --> 02:10:49,235
Now he..will get up
tomorrow morning.

2118
02:10:49,941 --> 02:10:53,877
So all of you were..
- Planning to kill you.

2119
02:10:53,945 --> 02:10:55,242
Quiet.

2120
02:10:55,947 --> 02:10:58,279
Sir, what should we do?
- I say..

2121
02:10:58,349 --> 02:11:00,317
What? Shut up. I am talking to you.

2122
02:11:00,552 --> 02:11:01,883
This cannot be possible!

2123
02:11:01,953 --> 02:11:03,011
lt can be.

2124
02:11:03,087 --> 02:11:04,611
If you can't find Baygon
for killing cockroaches..

2125
02:11:04,889 --> 02:11:07,221
..then you can use
Paragon slippers as well.

2126
02:11:09,327 --> 02:11:11,852
Sir, I say let's slash his wrist.

2127
02:11:11,896 --> 02:11:12,885
No, no.

2128
02:11:12,964 --> 02:11:14,226
But there is a big difference..

2129
02:11:14,265 --> 02:11:16,028
..in slashing your own wrist
or somebody else doing it.

2130
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:17,362
Sir, we will be in trouble
during the enquiry. - Yes.

2131
02:11:17,502 --> 02:11:18,594
Right.

2132
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:20,167
Everyone will be in trouble.

2133
02:11:20,538 --> 02:11:22,472
Sir, best is to hang him
from the fan.

2134
02:11:24,108 --> 02:11:26,076
If we hang him from the fan..

2135
02:11:26,144 --> 02:11:28,442
..the fan will break
under his weight. - Yes.

2136
02:11:29,547 --> 02:11:31,447
Sir, let's strangle him.

2137
02:11:31,482 --> 02:11:33,347
And we can say that he
hanged himseIf. - No, sir.

2138
02:11:33,484 --> 02:11:36,009
Sir, if we strangle him
then there will be a V mark.

2139
02:11:36,087 --> 02:11:37,884
And if we hang him
there will be an O mark.

2140
02:11:37,956 --> 02:11:38,650
We can get caught.

2141
02:11:38,923 --> 02:11:41,483
V, O. what the..

2142
02:11:41,659 --> 02:11:44,093
DGP, do you hear what
they are saying?

2143
02:11:44,162 --> 02:11:45,254
DGP!

2144
02:11:46,030 --> 02:11:47,998
Where is the DGP?

2145
02:11:48,399 --> 02:11:49,491
High BP.

2146
02:11:50,134 --> 02:11:51,863
He is asleep.

2147
02:11:52,036 --> 02:11:55,028
Let's throw him down the
three storied building in front.

2148
02:11:55,073 --> 02:11:56,597
Have you lost your mind?

2149
02:11:56,875 --> 02:11:58,206
Sir, if we throw him down
the three storey building..

2150
02:11:58,276 --> 02:11:59,243
..he will only break his limbs.

2151
02:11:59,310 --> 02:12:00,140
He won't die.

2152
02:12:00,211 --> 02:12:01,576
Let's throw him from
the sixth floor.

2153
02:12:01,846 --> 02:12:03,575
Then let's throw him down
twice from the third floor.

2154
02:12:03,848 --> 02:12:05,873
Three. Three. Six.

2155
02:12:05,950 --> 02:12:08,214
ls this a joke?

2156
02:12:08,519 --> 02:12:09,417
Am I a goat?

2157
02:12:09,854 --> 02:12:11,048
Kill him. Throw him down.

2158
02:12:11,122 --> 02:12:12,214
Make mincemeat out of him.

2159
02:12:13,358 --> 02:12:17,089
I am Jaikant Shikre.
I will shoot each one.

2160
02:12:17,295 --> 02:12:18,990
He gave us the best idea.

2161
02:12:19,330 --> 02:12:22,993
Abbas, that stolen
gun lying in the car.

2162
02:12:23,468 --> 02:12:25,060
Blow his brains out with that.

2163
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:26,294
Sir.

2164
02:12:26,471 --> 02:12:28,564
After that your fingerprints on it.

2165
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:31,299
End of Jaikant and his case.

2166
02:12:32,911 --> 02:12:34,071
You will kill me?

2167
02:12:34,913 --> 02:12:37,541
Not me, Jaikant, your arrogance.

2168
02:12:38,049 --> 02:12:39,880
Your ego will kill you.

2169
02:12:40,251 --> 02:12:41,479
You cheat.

2170
02:12:43,354 --> 02:12:46,118
You cheat. You cheat. You cheat.

2171
02:12:47,292 --> 02:12:51,251
You brought the entire
police force to kill me.

2172
02:12:52,931 --> 02:12:54,489
He is a villain and not the hero.

2173
02:12:56,034 --> 02:12:57,865
He always cheats me.

2174
02:12:59,070 --> 02:13:02,130
First in the village he
brought all the villagers.

2175
02:13:02,974 --> 02:13:07,070
And now in Goa you brought
the entire police force.

2176
02:13:08,079 --> 02:13:12,948
I was sleeping quietly. Dreaming.

2177
02:13:13,952 --> 02:13:16,921
And all my dreams will be fuIfilled.

2178
02:13:18,423 --> 02:13:23,224
Now its my turn!

2179
02:14:00,932 --> 02:14:02,490
I can't remember the number.

2180
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:04,158
I have lost my mind.

2181
02:14:04,235 --> 02:14:06,499
9999..

2182
02:14:06,904 --> 02:14:08,462
Oh my, God.

2183
02:14:11,075 --> 02:14:13,009
Hello, police control room.
- Hello.

2184
02:14:13,411 --> 02:14:14,503
This is Jaikant Shikre speaking.

2185
02:14:14,879 --> 02:14:16,403
These police officers
want to kill me.

2186
02:14:16,447 --> 02:14:18,540
I want protection.
- Where are you speaking from?

2187
02:14:18,616 --> 02:14:19,981
I am calling from
a telephone booth..

2188
02:14:20,051 --> 02:14:21,313
..in front of the old secretariat.

2189
02:14:21,419 --> 02:14:23,114
Just a minute.
- Yes.

2190
02:14:24,622 --> 02:14:25,418
Hello, Singham sir.

2191
02:14:25,857 --> 02:14:26,585
Jaikant is in a telephone booth..

2192
02:14:26,858 --> 02:14:27,882
..in front of the old secretariat.

2193
02:14:27,959 --> 02:14:29,187
I am not, I am not.

2194
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:31,023
I am not there.

2195
02:14:38,136 --> 02:14:40,127
Do they get diesel for free?

2196
02:14:40,238 --> 02:14:42,138
The whole police
department is after me!

2197
02:14:52,283 --> 02:14:53,443
Excuse me.

2198
02:14:53,518 --> 02:14:55,042
Do you have a mobile?

2199
02:14:55,386 --> 02:14:56,546
Do you have a mobile?

2200
02:14:58,890 --> 02:15:00,187
Nothing. Nothing.

2201
02:15:00,258 --> 02:15:02,556
Nothing. I have to run.
What shall I do now?

2202
02:15:02,827 --> 02:15:05,091
Mr. Shikre, you here?

2203
02:15:05,163 --> 02:15:06,528
I am here for admission.
- What?

2204
02:15:06,831 --> 02:15:10,198
My life is in danger, do something?
- Just a minute.

2205
02:15:10,835 --> 02:15:11,597
What are you doing?

2206
02:15:11,869 --> 02:15:14,099
I am calling the police.
- Not the police.

2207
02:15:14,172 --> 02:15:14,968
I..

2208
02:15:15,039 --> 02:15:16,165
No police.

2209
02:15:26,350 --> 02:15:27,908
''Singham.''

2210
02:15:30,922 --> 02:15:32,355
''Singham.''

2211
02:15:35,293 --> 02:15:37,158
''Singham.''

2212
02:15:42,166 --> 02:15:43,599
''Singham.''

2213
02:15:58,416 --> 02:15:59,440
Come on.

2214
02:16:01,452 --> 02:16:02,510
Come on.

2215
02:16:07,658 --> 02:16:08,625
Brother.

2216
02:16:22,073 --> 02:16:24,064
Before this, another inspector
was acting too smart here.

2217
02:16:24,142 --> 02:16:28,511
Right on this chair,
he shot himseIf.

2218
02:16:34,051 --> 02:16:37,145
'I Bajirao Singham pledge of..'

2219
02:16:39,991 --> 02:16:44,485
'..total devotion
towards carrying out my duty..

2220
02:16:44,896 --> 02:16:48,093
..with integrity, honesty,
hard work..

2221
02:16:51,435 --> 02:16:57,999
..impartiality and by
civilized behavior towards all.'

2222
02:17:08,286 --> 02:17:10,049
No. No. Let me stay here.

2223
02:17:10,121 --> 02:17:12,453
Hey! Let me go.

2224
02:17:20,531 --> 02:17:22,260
Your boss is dead.

2225
02:17:23,601 --> 02:17:26,900
Change your statement or
else we will kill you too.

2226
02:17:31,175 --> 02:17:33,439
Shiva Rai has given a
statement to the police..

2227
02:17:33,477 --> 02:17:35,206
..that he was Jaikant Shikre's ally.

2228
02:17:35,513 --> 02:17:40,075
And all drugs, kidnapping,
land-grabbing, extortion rackets..

2229
02:17:40,151 --> 02:17:42,210
..were run by Jaikant
Shikre with the support..

2230
02:17:42,286 --> 02:17:43,878
..of Minister Narvekar.

2231
02:17:44,222 --> 02:17:45,917
And Jaikant Shikre
is also responsible..

2232
02:17:45,990 --> 02:17:47,855
..for inspector
Rakesh Kadam's death.

2233
02:17:48,025 --> 02:17:49,356
After getting the evidence..

2234
02:17:49,427 --> 02:17:52,055
..when our officer went
to arrest Jaikant Shikre.

2235
02:17:58,069 --> 02:18:00,435
Embarrassed about his arrest..

2236
02:18:00,972 --> 02:18:03,406
..he shot himseIf before
the swear-in ceremony.

2237
02:18:05,977 --> 02:18:11,916
And..police found the
dead body of Jaikant Shikre.

2238
02:18:19,290 --> 02:18:22,191
From these evidences
and Shiva's statement..

2239
02:18:22,260 --> 02:18:23,454
..the police has also found out..

2240
02:18:23,494 --> 02:18:26,463
..that inspector
Rakesh Kadam was not guilty.

2241
02:18:26,664 --> 02:18:30,600
Our Goa Police
department appeals to the court..

2242
02:18:31,035 --> 02:18:35,028
..to acquit all charges pressed
against inspector Rakesh Kadam.

2243
02:18:35,139 --> 02:18:40,042
Because he was an
honest police officer.

2244
02:18:43,881 --> 02:18:45,178
''The heart races.''

2245
02:18:45,249 --> 02:18:46,273
''The body trembles.''

2246
02:18:46,350 --> 02:18:48,341
''When you know he's coming.''

2247
02:18:48,419 --> 02:18:50,080
''Singham.''

2248
02:18:52,857 --> 02:18:57,123
''He never spares the bad.''

2249
02:18:57,261 --> 02:19:01,891
''Embraces the good.''

2250
02:19:02,033 --> 02:19:03,125
''He is unequalled.''

2251
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:04,224
''He is very strong.''

2252
02:19:04,302 --> 02:19:06,167
''Singham is a destroyer of evil.''

2253
02:19:06,437 --> 02:19:07,495
''The heart races.''

2254
02:19:07,571 --> 02:19:08,629
''The body trembles.''

2255
02:19:08,906 --> 02:19:10,931
''When you know he's coming.''

2256
02:19:11,008 --> 02:19:12,066
''Singham.''
