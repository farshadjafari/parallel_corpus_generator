00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,001
* = Music or songs

3
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:06,000
*"Leaning on the everlasting arms"
playing softly*

4
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,658
People did not give it credence that
a young girl could leave home.

5
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:20,564
And go off in the winter time
to avenge her father's blood.

6
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,057
But it did happen.

7
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:28,359
I was just fourteen years of age when a coward
by the name of Tom Chaney shot my father down.

8
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:31,191
And robbed him of his life, and his horse.

9
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:34,319
And two California gold pieces that he carried
in his trouser pant.

10
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:37,933
Chaney was a hired man.

11
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:42,789
And Papa had taken him up to fort Smith
to help lead back a string of mustang ponies he'd brought.

12
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:46,724
In town, Chaney had followed to drink.

13
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:49,652
And cards, and lost all his money.

14
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,742
He got it into his head he was being cheated.

15
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:55,621
And went back to the boarding house
for his Henry Rifle.

16
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,305
When Papa tried to intervene.

17
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,256
Chaney shot him.

18
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:03,307
Chaney fled.

19
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:09,324
He could have walked his horse.

20
00:02:09,324 --> 00:02:12,526
For not a soul in that city could
be bothered to give chase.

21
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,459
No doubt Chaney fancied himself, scott free.

22
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:20,638
But he was wrong.

23
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:24,348
You must pay for everything in this world,
one way or another.

24
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:27,431
There is nothing free.

25
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:29,651
Except the grace of God.

26
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,280
Is that the man?

27
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:22,770
That is my father.

28
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:24,270
If you would like to kiss him,

29
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:26,954
It would be all right.

30
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:28,420
He's gone to heaven.

31
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:30,485
Praise the Lord.

32
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,776
Why is it so much?

33
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:34,569
The quality of the casket.

34
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,206
And of the embaming.

35
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:39,466
The life like appearance requires time and art.

36
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:43,021
And the chemicals go dear,
particulars are nubbin.

37
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:48,378
If you'd like to kiss him, It would be all right.

38
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,290
Thank you, the spirit does flow.

39
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,109
Your wire said fifty dollars.

40
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,844
You did not specify that
he was to be shipped.

41
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:58,224
Well sixty dollars is every cent we have.
That leaves nothing for our board.

42
00:03:58,225 --> 00:04:02,188
Yarnell you proceed for the body to be
transport at the train station, and complete home.

43
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:03,576
I'll sleep here tonight.

44
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,288
I want to collect father's receipts
and see to other business.

45
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,298
Your mama didn't say nothing about you
settling no business here.

46
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,540
It's business mama didn't know about. It's all right
Yarnell, I dismiss you.

47
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,454
I am not sure.

48
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:17,742
Tell mama not to sign anything until I return home
and see that Papa is buried in his Mason's apron.

49
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:21,418
Your terms are agreeable, if I might
pass the night here.

50
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,860
Here, among these people?

51
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:29,139
-These people?
-I'm expecting three more souls.

52
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:33,851
Sutherland, Smith, and His-tongue-in-the-rain.

53
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,370
Take it easy gentlemen, you were aware.

54
00:04:36,894 --> 00:04:39,968
And train up your children the way
that they should go.

55
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,521
You see what has become of me.

56
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,108
Because of drink.

57
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:45,644
I killed a man.

58
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,029
In a triffiling quarrel over a pocket knife.

59
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:53,778
If I had received this instruction as a child...

60
00:04:53,778 --> 00:04:55,082
Could you point out the sheriff?

61
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,356
Him with the moustaches.

62
00:04:57,358 --> 00:05:02,024
I would be with my wife and children today.
I do not know what is to become of them.

63
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:11,576
But I hope and pray that she will not slight
them and compel them to go into low company.

64
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:21,345
Well.

65
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,266
I killed the wrong man, as the which why I'm here.

66
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,002
Had I killed the man I meant to. I don't
believed I'd a been convicted.

67
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:33,220
I see men out there in that crowd,
that's worse than me.

68
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:37,598
Okay.

69
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:43,326
Before I hang, I would like to say.

70
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:49,274
(Chanting in Indian tongue)

71
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,295
Naw, we ain't arrested him.

72
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,819
They caught up to him, but he lit
out to the territory.

73
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:05,045
I would think that he throwed in to
Lucky Ned Pepper, who's gang robbed him.

74
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:07,406
Mail house yesterday at the Rotel river.

75
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,209
Well, why are you not looking for him?

76
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:11,435
I ain't no authority in the Indian Nation.

77
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,565
Tom Chaney is the business of the U.S Marshalls now.

78
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:15,952
When will they arrest him?

79
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:19,029
Not soon, I'm afraid, the Marshalls are not well staffed.

80
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:24,036
And  I'll tell you, frankly, Chaney is at the
end of a long list of fugitives and malefactors.

81
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:27,175
Could I hire a Marshall to pursue Tom Chaney?

82
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,384
You have a lot of experience with
bounty hunters, do you?

83
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:33,117
That is a silly question. I am here
to settle my father's affairs.

84
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:35,822
-All alone.
-I am the person for it.

85
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:38,821
Mama was never any good at sums.
And she could hardly spell 'cat'.

86
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,985
I intend to see Papa's killer hang.

87
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:45,384
Well, nothing prevents you from offering a
reward and so informing the Marshalls.

88
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,507
I'd pay real  money though,
to be persuasive.

89
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:49,887
Chaney's across the river, in Choctaw nation.

90
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:52,252
I will see to the money.
Who's the best Marshall?

91
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:54,327
I'd have to weigh that.

92
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:57,238
William Waters, is the best tracker.

93
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,516
He's half Comanche, and it is something
to see him cut the sun.

94
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:03,521
The meanest, is Rooster Cogburn.

95
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,807
He is a pitiless man. Double tough.
Fear don't enter into his thinking.

96
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,673
Hmm, lots of pulled cork.

97
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:13,975
The best is probably, L.T. Quinn.

98
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,082
He brings his prisoners in alive.

99
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,774
Now he may let one slip out.

100
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:22,577
Now and again, but he believes that even the
worst of men, is entitled to a fair share.

101
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:25,096
Where can I find this, Rooster?

102
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,526
The place is occupied.

103
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:31,637
I know it is occupied Mr. Cogburn.
As I said, I have business with you.

104
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,201
I have prior business.

105
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,768
You've been at it for quite some time,
Mr. Cogburn.

106
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,941
There is no call for my business.

107
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,637
The hell with you. How did you spot me here?

108
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,564
The sheriff told me to look in the saloon.

109
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,127
The saloon had afford me here, we must talk.

110
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,024
Women aren't allowed in the saloon.

111
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:54,370
I was not there as a customer.
I am fourteen years old.

112
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,490
The place is occupied.

113
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,869
Will be for some time.

114
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,264
Good evening.

115
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:25,838
If you would like to sleep in a coffin,
I would be honored.

116
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:47,879
How much are you paying for cotton?

117
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:52,961
Nine and a half, for low and middlin'
and ten for ordinary.

118
00:08:54,073 --> 00:08:55,903
Think I'm surprise of that, really.

119
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:59,077
I sold to the Wizten brothers in
Little Rock for eleven cents.

120
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,836
Then I suggest you take the balance of it
to the Witzen brothers.

121
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:06,315
I take the balance to Witzen.

122
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:09,140
At ten and a half.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,817
Why'd you come here to tell me this?

124
00:09:12,817 --> 00:09:17,201
I thought I might shop around a
place. I'm doing alright in Little Rock.

125
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,614
I'm Mattie Ross.

126
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:22,865
Daughter of Frank Ross.

127
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:26,102
Aw, tragic thing.

128
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:29,671
May I say, your father impressed me.

129
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:34,224
With his manly qualities. He was a close trader,
but he acted a gentleman.

130
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:37,907
My post was to sell those ponies back to
you, that  my father brought.

131
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:39,804
Well that I fear, is out of the question.

132
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:42,772
Well, we'll see that they are shipped to
you, at my earliest convenience.

133
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:44,783
We don't want the ponies now, we don't need them.

134
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,133
Well that hardly concerns me. Your
father brought the ponies, and paid for them.

135
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:50,827
And there's an end to it. I have the bill of sale.

136
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:54,399
And I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse that
was stolen from your stable.

137
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,774
You'll have to take that up with the
man who stole the horse.

138
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,738
Tom Chaney stole the horse
while it was in your care.

139
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,149
You were responsible.

140
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,092
Yeah, I admire your sin.

141
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:09,599
But I believe you'll find I'm not
liable for such claims.

142
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,916
You were the custodian.

143
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:14,404
If you were a bank that were robbed. You could not
simply tell your depositors to go hang.

144
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:18,461
I do not entertain hypotheticals.
The world as it is vexing enough.

145
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:22,533
Secondly your evaluation of the horse is high.

146
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,748
By about two hundred dollars.
How old are you?

147
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,841
If anything, my purse is low.

148
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:29,033
My Judy was a fine racing mare.

149
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:32,355
I've seen her jump a eight rung fence
with a rider at four eighteen.

150
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,873
Oh, it's all very interesting.

151
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:38,051
The ponies are yours, take them.

152
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,931
Your father horse was stolen by a murderous criminal.

153
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:45,647
I have provided reasonable protection for the creature
as per our implicit agreement.

154
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:50,056
My watchmen had his teeth knocked out,
you can take on his suit.

155
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:51,524
That would take to long.

156
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:53,014
You have no case.

157
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:54,937
Courage would make the dartmore to long.

158
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:56,769
This is by a jury.

159
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:58,731
Petitioned by a widow and three small children.

160
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:06,230
I will pay two hundred dollars to your fathers estate.

161
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:08,727
When I have in my hand a letter from your lawyer,

162
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:12,854
absolving me of all liability from the beginning
of the world to today.

163
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:13,933
I'll take two hundred dollars for Judy,

164
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:15,234
plus one hundred for the ponies.

165
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:17,725
And twenty five dollars for the grey horse
that Tom Chaney left.

166
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:19,455
He was easily worth, forty.

167
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:21,802
That is three hundred and twenty five dollars, sold.

168
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:25,043
The ponies have no part in it.
I will not buy them.

169
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,125
And the price for Judy is three hundred
and twenty five dollars.

170
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:31,144
I would not pay three hundred and twenty
five dollars for winged Pegasus.

171
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:34,544
As for the grey horse,
it does not belong to you.

172
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,504
The grey horse was lent to Tom Chaney
by my father.

173
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:38,293
Chaney only had the use of him.

174
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:42,495
I would pay two hundred and twenty five dollars.

175
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:44,383
And keep the grey horse.

176
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,870
And I want the ponies.

177
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,006
Then it's settled, then.

178
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:50,049
There will be no settlement after I leave this
office and go to the court of law.

179
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:51,586
All right, this is my last offer.

180
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:54,385
Two hundred and fifty dollars.

181
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:57,895
For that I get the release, previously discussed.

182
00:11:57,897 --> 00:12:00,014
And I keep your father's saddle.

183
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,176
The grey horse is not yours to sell.

184
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:04,256
The saddle is not for sale. I will keep it.

185
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:08,368
Glory Daniel will approve of the grey horse.
He will come after you with a great vengeance.

186
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:11,542
What? All right, now look,
listen very carefully.

187
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:13,255
As I will not bargain further.

188
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:16,841
I'll will take the ponies back, and the
grey horse. Which is mine.

189
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,001
And settle...

190
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:22,971
For three hundred dollars. Now you must
take that or leave it.

191
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:25,192
And I do not much care which it is.

192
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,923
My Lawyer Decker would not wish me to consider
anything under three hundred and twenty five dollars.

193
00:12:31,924 --> 00:12:34,553
But I will settle for three hundred and twenty.

194
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,539
If I am given twenty in advance.

195
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,568
Now here's what I have to say
about that saddle.

196
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:49,317
Frank Post's store.

197
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,802
Oh, poor child.

198
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:59,774
Now you are staying with us, or
you hurry back home to your momma.

199
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,594
I'll stay here, if you can have me.

200
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:04,432
I just had my stay at the undertakers.

201
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,168
In the company of three corpses.

202
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,229
I felt like Ezekiel.

203
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:10,644
In valley of the dry bones.

204
00:13:10,644 --> 00:13:12,256
Then, God bless you.

205
00:13:12,552 --> 00:13:16,618
Now that you'll be rooming with,
Grandma Turner.

206
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,173
But that is all that we got, with all the people
in town come to see the hanging.

207
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:26,168
This was in your poor father's room.

208
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:28,274
That is everything.

209
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,654
There are no light fingers in this house.

210
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,754
If you need something for to
tote the gun around?

211
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:46,846
I can give you an empty flour sack for a nickel.

212
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:27,990
Well what did you see when you arrived?

213
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:32,244
A woman, was out in the yard.

214
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:34,780
Dead with blow flies on her face.

215
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:40,793
An old man was inside with his breast
opened by a scatter gun. His feet burned.

216
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:44,966
He was still alive, but just. Said those
two Wharton boys had done it.

217
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:46,927
-Rode up, drunk.
-Objection.

218
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,205
Hearsay.

219
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,640
My declaration, your honor.

220
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,822
Objection's overruled.
Proceed Mr. Cogburn.

221
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:58,114
Now them two Wharton boys, Otis
and C.C. rode down on him.

222
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:01,450
Asked him where his money was,
but he wouldn't tell them.

223
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:04,134
They lit pine nut items to his feet.

224
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:07,909
He told them the money was in the fruit jar.

225
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:11,251
Under a grey rock at the corner of the smoke house.

226
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:12,261
And then?

227
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:16,394
Well I got on, after one considerable fact.

228
00:15:16,394 --> 00:15:17,456
What'd you do then?

229
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,533
I and Marshall Potter and
went out to the smoke house.

230
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,777
And that rock had been moved, the
jar with the money in it was gone.

231
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:27,611
-Objection, speculative.
-Sustained.

232
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:31,222
You found a flat grey rock, in the corner of the smoke house.

233
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:33,538
With a hollowed out space there.

234
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:36,846
If the prosecutor is going to give evidence,
I suggest he be sworn.

235
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:41,105
Mr. Cogburn. What did you find, if anything,
in the corner of that smokehouse?

236
00:15:41,337 --> 00:15:45,384
Halved-out grey rock with a hollowed
out space under it, nothing there.

237
00:15:45,384 --> 00:15:47,479
-Well what did you?
-No jar or nothing.

238
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:53,640
Well, rode up to the Wharton boys area,
there with a north fork tracker The Canadian.

239
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:54,856
What did you find?

240
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:55,889
The Canadian.

241
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:01,457
I had my glass, spotted them two boys
and their old daddy Aaron.

242
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,687
Went down the quick bank with some hogs.

243
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,745
They killed a shoat.

244
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:08,818
And a fire built up under a wash pot
for scalding water.

245
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,759
What'dja do?

246
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,082
Announced we was U.S. Marshalls, I hollered
out to Aaron.

247
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,506
I needed to talk to his two boys.

248
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:18,033
He raised an axe.

249
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:20,854
Raised to cussing us and blathering this court.

250
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,046
What did he do then?

251
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,221
I backed away from the axe.

252
00:16:25,222 --> 00:16:26,960
Tried to talked some sense into him.

253
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:33,913
While this was going on C.C. he edges over
to the wash pot there, behind the steam.

254
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:35,921
Picks up a shot gun.

255
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:39,162
Potter seen him, but it was to late.

256
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:43,104
C.C. went and pulled out on
Potter with one barrel.

257
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:45,438
Turned to do the same for me and I shot him.

258
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,980
And the old man raised the axe.

259
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:50,171
And I shot him.

260
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,431
Otis lit out, and I shot him.

261
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:02,898
Bizzy working there when he hit the ground,
Otis was just gone.

262
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,771
Did you find the jar with a
hundred and twenty dollars in it?

263
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,865
-Leading.
-Sustained.

264
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:08,847
What happened then?

265
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:11,608
Found a jar with a hundred and twenty dollars in it.

266
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:14,719
What became of Otis Wood?

267
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,200
There he sits.

268
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:20,201
You may ask, Mr. Gaudy.

269
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:21,914
Thank you Mr. Farlow.

270
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,270
Mr. Cogburn.

271
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:40,719
In your four years as a U.S. Marshall.

272
00:17:40,868 --> 00:17:42,593
How many men have you shot?

273
00:17:44,092 --> 00:17:45,652
Never shot nobody that didn't ask for it.

274
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:47,578
Well that was not the question.

275
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,511
How many?

276
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:52,099
Shot or killed?

277
00:17:52,101 --> 00:17:56,365
Let us restrict it to killed, so that
we may have a manageable figure.

278
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,846
About twelve.

279
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:02,410
Fifteen stopped them in flight,
defended myself, etcetera.

280
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:04,173
Around twelve he says.

281
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:05,882
Or fifteen.

282
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:09,602
So many, you cannot keep
a precise count.

283
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:13,377
I have examined the records, and can
supply the accurate figure.

284
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,549
Uhh...

285
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:19,365
I believe them two Wharton boys
makes it twenty three.

286
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:22,478
And how many members of this one family,

287
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,932
the Wharton family, have you killed?

288
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:29,693
-Inebriated or..
-Didn't you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother?

289
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:31,597
And Clete Wharton, half brother.

290
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,714
Well Clete was selling northern spirits to the Cherokee.
He come at me with a king bolt

291
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,169
A King bolt?

292
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,021
You are armed, and he advanced upon you.

293
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,864
With nothing more than a king bolt?

294
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:47,424
From a wagon turn?

295
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:51,411
I've seen men retort with nothing
more than a king bolt. I defended myself.

296
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:53,164
Returning to the other encounter.

297
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,673
With Aaron Wharton, and his two remaining sons.

298
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,153
You sprang from cover.

299
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:00,678
With revolver in hand.

300
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,577
-That'd be it.
-Loaded and cocked.

301
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:05,297
Well if it ain't loaded
and cocked, it don't shoot.

302
00:19:05,673 --> 00:19:10,737
And like his son, Aaron Wharton advanced
against an armed man.

303
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:12,865
Well he was armed, he had an axed raised.

304
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:15,844
I believe you testified you backed away
from Aaron Wharton.

305
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:18,067
-That's right.
-Which direction were you going?

306
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:21,244
I always go backwards,
when I'm backing up.

307
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
Very amusing.

308
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:29,967
Yeah, he advanced on you much
in the manner of Clete Wharton.

309
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:35,048
Menacing you with that little ol' King bolt,
or mince packer, or whatever that was.

310
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,798
Said he surely commit to cussin'.

311
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,520
-Laid about a threat.
-And you were backing away.

312
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:44,519
How many steps before the shooting started?

313
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:49,173
Uh, seven to eight steps.

314
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:51,180
Good, and Wharton keeping pace.

315
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,577
Advancing away from his campfire.

316
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:56,723
Seven, eight, steps.

317
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,373
What would that be?

318
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,048
Fifteen, twenty take?

319
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,105
I suppose.

320
00:20:02,105 --> 00:20:05,308
Will you explain to this jury, Mr. Cogburn.

321
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:10,449
Why Mr. Wharton was found immediately by his
wash pot, one arm in the fire.

322
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,595
His sleeve and hand smoldering.

323
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,163
Did you move the body after you shot him?

324
00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:15,479
Why would I do that?

325
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,580
You did not drag the body over to
the fire and throw his arm in.

326
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:20,576
-No, sir.
-Two witnesses.

327
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:23,571
Who arrived on the scene will testify
to the location of the body.

328
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:26,242
You do not remember moving the body.

329
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:32,847
So it was, a cold blooded bushwhack,
while poor Mr. Wharton was tending his campfire.

330
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:33,961
Objection.

331
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:37,250
If that's where the body was,
I might have moved him.

332
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,949
I do not remember.

333
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,900
Why, would you move the body, Mr. Cogburn?

334
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:45,923
Them hogs were moving around,
they might have moved him.

335
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:48,791
I'd do not remember.

336
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:54,570
... son of a bitch.

337
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:56,230
-Mr. Cogburn.
-What do you want?

338
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:57,363
I'd like to talk to you a minute.

339
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,708
What is it?

340
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:03,064
They tell me you're a man with, True Grit.

341
00:21:05,886 --> 00:21:07,121
What do you want, girl?

342
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:08,721
Speak up, tucker down.

343
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:09,996
Let me do that.

344
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:12,323
Your makings are due dry.

345
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:16,359
I'm looking for the man who shot and killed my father,
Frank Ross in front of the Monarch boarding house.

346
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,612
The man's name is Tom Chaney.

347
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:21,700
They say he's over in Indian territory,
and I need someone to go after him.

348
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,615
What's your name, girl.

349
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,157
My name is Mattie Ross.

350
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:28,259
We're located in Yell county.

351
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:31,472
My mother is at home looking after my
sister Victoria and my brother little Frank.

352
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:33,624
You best go home to them.

353
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,621
They'll need help with the charges.

354
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:37,077
There is a fugitive warrant out for Chaney.

355
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:40,501
Government will pay you two dollars to
bringing him in plus two cents a mile for expenses.

356
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:43,396
On top of that, I will pay you
a fifty dollar reward.

357
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:46,679
What are you?

358
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:49,685
What you got there in your poke?

359
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:54,536
My god, poke for a gun.

360
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:58,596
You're no bigger than a corn muffin.
What are you doing with a pistol like that?

361
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:00,557
Well I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it.

362
00:22:00,557 --> 00:22:02,926
-Kill Tom Chaney?
-Well the law prefers to do so.

363
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:04,859
Well that piece will do the job for you.

364
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:08,326
If you find a house Dep to arrest him for you,
and the world is behind you.

365
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,605
Nobody here knew my father and I'm,

366
00:22:09,605 --> 00:22:12,374
afraid nothing's going to be done about
Chaney except I do it.

367
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:16,005
My brother is a child, and my mother is
indecisive and hobbled by grief.

368
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,788
I don't believe you fifty dollars.

369
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:23,469
I will contract Lieutenant Stone, who will
wish to make payment tomorrow, or the next day.

370
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,989
Once our lawyer countersigns.

371
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:33,285
Don't believe in fairy tales sermons or stories about
muddy babies. Accepting but thanks for the cigarette.

372
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:19,143
Isn't your Mama expecting you home, dear?

373
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:21,227
My business is not yet finished.

374
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:24,615
Mrs. Flor, have any rooms opened up?

375
00:23:24,616 --> 00:23:28,653
Grandma Turners. The bed is quite narrow.

376
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,569
The second floor in the back did open up.

377
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,865
But uh, that gentleman on the porch,

378
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:35,269
has just taken it.

379
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,051
Oh but don't worry yourself, dear.

380
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:40,662
You're not disturbing Grandma Turner.

381
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:25,849
My name is La Boeuf.

382
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:29,259
I just come from Yell county.

383
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:33,266
We have no ruffian friends in Yell county.

384
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:40,744
The all get you ....

385
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,981
I saw your mother yesterday morning.

386
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,885
She said for you to come right on home.

387
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:46,794
What was your business there?

388
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:00,417
This is a man I think you know.

389
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:04,768
You called him Tom Chaney.

390
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:09,305
I believe. All the months I've been tracking
him he has used the name, Theron Chelmsford.

391
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:10,695
John Todd Anderson,

392
00:25:10,696 --> 00:25:12,020
and others.

393
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:15,361
He dailed in Monroe Louisiana, and
Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

394
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:17,345
Before turning up at your fathers place.

395
00:25:17,346 --> 00:25:20,992
Then why did you not catch him at,
Pine Bluff Arkansas or Monroe Louisiana?

396
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,921
He is a crafty one.

397
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:26,176
I thought him slow witted myself.

398
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:28,824
That was his act.

399
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,344
It was a good one.

400
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:31,955
Are you some kind of law?

401
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,072
That's right

402
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,278
I'm a Texas Ranger.

403
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:42,298
Don't that make you a big noise
in that state.

404
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:46,052
In Arkansas you should know
you Texas Rangers trappings and title

405
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:47,218
do not make him more addictive to fame.

406
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,702
Why have you been ineffectually pursuing Chaney?

407
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:55,933
He shot and killed a state senator
named Bibs in Waco Texas.

408
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:57,878
Bib's finally put out a reward.

409
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,097
And who say's Chaney killed this senator.

410
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:02,403
I understand there was an argument about a dog.

411
00:26:02,403 --> 00:26:04,497
You know anything about the
whereabouts of Chaney?

412
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:08,056
Well he's in the territory, and I hold out
little hope for winning your bounty.

413
00:26:08,056 --> 00:26:10,261
-Why is that?
-I'm going to beat you to him.

414
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:13,060
I've hired a deputy Marshall.
The toughest one they have.

415
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:17,029
And he's familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper gang
they say Chaney's tied up with.

416
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:20,137
Well, I will throw in with you
and your Marshall.

417
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:22,563
No, Marshall Cogburn and I are fine.

418
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:24,153
It'll be to our mutual advantage.

419
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:27,095
Your Marshall, I presume, knows the territory.

420
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:30,606
I know Chaney. It's at least a two man
job to take him in alive.

421
00:26:30,607 --> 00:26:34,028
When Chaney is taken he's going to
Fort Smith to be hanged.

422
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:37,205
I'm not having him go to Texas to
hang for shooting a Senator.

423
00:26:37,207 --> 00:26:39,771
It is not important where he hangs, it is?

424
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:40,772
It is to me.

425
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:42,093
Is it to you?

426
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:43,510
It means a great deal of money to me,

427
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:46,105
and many month's work.

428
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,901
Oh I'm sorry that you won't be
at peace working for your wages.

429
00:26:48,902 --> 00:26:52,365
And that you'd be willing to go
after a half-wit.

430
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:57,644
You give out very little shivle
with your pronouncements.

431
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:01,256
When I sat there watching, I gave some
thought to stealing a kiss.

432
00:27:01,564 --> 00:27:03,671
But you are very young and sick, and

433
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,148
unattractive to boot, but

434
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,075
now I have a mind to give you
five or six good licks with my belt.

435
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:12,290
That wouldn't be as unpleasant as the other.

436
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:16,165
You wet your comb, you might tame that cowlick.

437
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,819
(Lawyers voice)
Madame, I wish you would leave these matters

438
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:22,625
entirely to me or at the very least

439
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:26,002
give me the courtesy of consulting me before
entering such agreements.

440
00:27:26,506 --> 00:27:30,200
I am not scolding you, but I am saying your
head strong ways,

441
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:32,548
will lead you into a tight corner one day.

442
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,827
I trust the enclosed document

443
00:27:34,828 --> 00:27:37,880
will let you conclude your business and
return to Yell County.

444
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:41,079
Yours, J. Mulden Daggett.

445
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,517
I was just as bad yesterday as
you look today.

446
00:27:43,518 --> 00:27:46,164
Of course you don't have
to bed with Grandma Turner.

447
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,724
I'm not acquainted with Grandma Turner.

448
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:54,590
She's a resident of the city, it does not
surprise me that she carry's disease.

449
00:27:56,929 --> 00:27:59,684
This malaria's place has ruined my health.

450
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:01,532
As it has my finances.

451
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:03,788
I owe you money.

452
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:05,166
You were not treated poorly.

453
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:06,811
Oh, certainly not.

454
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:09,564
I'm paying you for a horse.

455
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:10,925
I do not possess.

456
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,281
And I brought back a string of useless ponies.

457
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:16,311
Which I cannot sell again.

458
00:28:16,313 --> 00:28:18,540
You're forgetting the Grey horse.

459
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:21,202
-Right.
-You were looking at the thing in the wrong light.

460
00:28:21,203 --> 00:28:24,710
I am looking at it in the light
of Gods eternal truth.

461
00:28:25,196 --> 00:28:27,924
Your illness is putting you down,
in the dumps.

462
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:29,832
You will soon find another buyer for the ponies.

463
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,099
Well I have a tentative offer
for ten dollars per head.

464
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,435
For the fixer soap works at Little Rock

465
00:28:36,436 --> 00:28:39,078
That would be a shame to discourage
the spirited horse flesh.

466
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:42,941
So it would. I'm confident the deal
will fall through.

467
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,566
Look here, I need a pony and I will
pay ten dollars for one of them.

468
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:51,023
Now that's a light price, no, no, I.

469
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:52,072
Wait a minute.

470
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:54,622
Are we trading again?

471
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:58,419
This one is beautiful.

472
00:29:16,895 --> 00:29:18,580
He don't know he got a rider.

473
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:20,837
You're to light.

474
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:26,448
Keep your key on the horse line.

475
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,015
He's very spirited.

476
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,815
I'll call him 'Little Blackie'.

477
00:29:29,816 --> 00:29:31,402
That's a good name.

478
00:29:33,843 --> 00:29:35,272
What does he like for a treat?

479
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:38,451
Well ma'am, he's a horse.

480
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,152
So he likes apples.

481
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:43,601
Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.

482
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:47,294
No ma'am, I ain't suppose to utter your name.

483
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,519
See, sleep.

484
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,765
That is fine, I will wake him.

485
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:57,519
Marshall Cogburn.

486
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:00,384
It is I, Mattie Ross, your employer.

487
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,523
How long 'till your ready to go?

488
00:30:03,915 --> 00:30:06,817
-Go where?
-To the Indian Territory to pursue Tom Chaney.

489
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,221
Oh, you're the grieved girl with
the stories of El Dorado.

490
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:16,144
Huh, how much money you got there?

491
00:30:16,144 --> 00:30:19,329
I would say fifty dollars to pursue Chaney,
you did not believe me.

492
00:30:20,088 --> 00:30:21,869
I did not know.

493
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,258
You are one to figure.

494
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,048
How long for you to make
ready to depart?

495
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:28,690
Well uh, hold on sis.

496
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:33,310
I remember your offer, I
do not remember agreeing to it.

497
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,775
If I'm to go up against, Ned Pepper.

498
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:41,244
Then I'll need a hundred dollars.
That much I can tell you. A hundred dollars.

499
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:46,368
To take your man, a hundred dollars.

500
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,306
Will take a fifty dollar advance for.
expenses.

501
00:30:53,307 --> 00:30:55,096
You are trying to take advantage of me.

502
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:57,127
I am giving you the children's rate.

503
00:30:57,128 --> 00:31:02,693
I'm not a shopper. An old man sleeping on a rope
bed. Living behind the Chinese groceries.

504
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:05,991
-I'd know it.
-You want to be kept in whiskey.

505
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:08,228
I wouldn't buy that.

506
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:09,542
I'd confiscate it.

507
00:31:09,544 --> 00:31:11,492
Enough for a quart.

508
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:12,755
Ah, thank you.

509
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:15,230
Hundred dollars, thats the rate.

510
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:17,028
Then I shall not haggle.

511
00:31:17,028 --> 00:31:18,894
Can we depart this afternoon?

512
00:31:19,557 --> 00:31:20,836
We?

513
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:24,176
You're not going, that ain't no part of it.

514
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:29,128
You have misjudged me if you think I'm silly enough
to give you fifty dollars and watch you simply ride off.

515
00:31:29,592 --> 00:31:31,237
I am a bonded U.S. Marshall.

516
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:32,429
Don't waste .... little with me.

517
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,638
I will see the thing done.

518
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,075
Damn ducks, can't go after Ned Pepper

519
00:31:37,076 --> 00:31:40,251
Mans' a hard man, and to look after
a baby at the same time.

520
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:41,413
I am not a baby.

521
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:45,747
Won't be staying at boarding houses,
where there's one bed and hot grub on the table.

522
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,092
Like to grab the saddle, eatin' light.

523
00:31:48,093 --> 00:31:50,597
Where the sleeping would only
take place on the ground.

524
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,367
Well I have slept out a night before.

525
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,544
Papa took me on a fine coon hunt
last summer on the Petty G.

526
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,134
We were on the hunt all night.

527
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:01,611
We sat around a big fire and told ghost stories.

528
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:03,088
We had a good time.

529
00:32:04,488 --> 00:32:05,816
Coon hunt?

530
00:32:05,817 --> 00:32:08,307
This ain't no coon drive.

531
00:32:08,307 --> 00:32:10,193
It is the same idea as a coon hunt.

532
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,641
To many important mouths to feed.

533
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:13,405
You would be assure to make
your work harder than it is.

534
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,830
Here's the money.

535
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:16,386
Now I aim to get Tom Chaney,

536
00:32:16,387 --> 00:32:18,887
and if you are not gamed, I will find
somebody who is gamed.

537
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:21,339
All I've heard out of you so far is talk.

538
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,432
I know you can drink whiskey, and snore and spit
and wallow in filth and bemoan your station.

539
00:32:24,434 --> 00:32:26,028
The rest has been spread to tie oh.

540
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:28,762
They told me you had grit, and
that is why I came to you.

541
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:32,531
I'm not paying for you talk. I can get all the talk
I need at the boarding house.

542
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:38,949
Wave your money.

543
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,304
Meet me here at seven o'clock tomorrow morning
and we can begin our 'coon hunt'.

544
00:32:52,088 --> 00:32:53,368
(Mattie)
Dearest mother,

545
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:57,179
I'm about to embark on a great adventure.

546
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,967
I have learned that Tom Chaney has
fled into the wild.

547
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:03,803
And I shall assist the authorities in pursuit.

548
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:06,430
You know that Papa would want me
to be firm in the right.

549
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:07,819
As he always was.

550
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:11,150
So do not fail on my account.

551
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:14,000
Tho I walk through the valley, of the shadow of death.

552
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,604
I shall fear no evil.

553
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:18,723
The author of all things watches over me, and

554
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:20,222
I have a fine horse.

555
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,278
Kiss little Frankie for me,
and pinch Violet's cheek.

556
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:26,037
My Papa's death will soon be avenged.

557
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,963
I'm off for the Choctaw nation,

558
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:39,689
Where's Marshall Cogburn?

559
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,801
Went away.

560
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:42,578
Left this.

561
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:49,980
(Rooster)
Here inside is a train ticket for your return home.

562
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:50,933
Use it.

563
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:54,786
By the time you read this, I will be across
the river in the Indian Nation.

564
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:56,688
Pursuit will be futile.

565
00:33:56,998 --> 00:33:59,271
I will return with your man, Chaney.

566
00:33:59,272 --> 00:34:01,135
Leave me to my work.

567
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:02,773
Rueben Cogburn.

568
00:34:10,773 --> 00:34:12,393
Is that Rooster Cogburn?

569
00:34:12,393 --> 00:34:13,773
Rider is in there.

570
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:14,788
Who's he with?

571
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,661
I do not know.

572
00:34:16,664 --> 00:34:17,880
Well take me across.

573
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:20,541
So, you're the runaway.

574
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,717
Marshall told me you'd show up.
I'm going to present you to the Sheriff.

575
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:26,867
That is a story, let go of my horse.
I have business across the river.

576
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:33,271
If you don't turn around and take me across,
You'll find yourself incorporated on the B.

577
00:34:33,974 --> 00:34:35,284
I have a good lawyer.

578
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:44,717
HEY!

579
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:47,817
Go, Little Blackie.

580
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:48,822
Come on.

581
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:03,090
That is quite a horse.

582
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:05,856
Probably give you ten dollars for him.

583
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:07,317
From the money you stole from me?

584
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:09,766
That was not stolen, I'm after your man.

585
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,280
I was to accompany you.

586
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,061
If I do not there is no agreement and
my money was stolen.

587
00:36:14,195 --> 00:36:16,349
Let's get this child back on the ferry

588
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:18,721
It's a long road and time's a wasting.

589
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:21,733
If I go back it's to the U.S. Marshals office
to report the theft of my money.

590
00:36:21,735 --> 00:36:24,583
And fuedal Marshall Cogburn?
Pursuit would be futile?

591
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:27,016
It's not spelled, F-U-D-E-L.

592
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:40,510
It's time for your spanking.

593
00:36:40,858 --> 00:36:44,030
Now you would DO it. No more speaking.

594
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,188
Or will get myself a burr switch
and strap your leg.

595
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:53,590
Are you going to let him do this, Marshall.

596
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:01,835
No, I don't believe I will.
Put your switch away, La Boeuf.

597
00:37:01,836 --> 00:37:03,849
I aim to finish what I started.

598
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:06,065
That'll be the biggest mistake you ever made.

599
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:07,847
Let's check this brass popper.

600
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,670
Pulled around by a little girl.

601
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:38,990
I am not accustomed to so large a fire.

602
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:45,458
In Texas we make due with a fire
a little more than twigs.

603
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:48,351
Buffalo chips.

604
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:50,521
Heat the nights rations of beans.

605
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:52,902
And it is ranger,

606
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:56,065
policy never to make the camp
the same place as your cook fire.

607
00:37:56,831 --> 00:38:00,014
Very imprudent to make your presence
known in unsettled country.

608
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:09,780
How do you know Baggett had intelligence?

609
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:11,840
He has a store.

610
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,257
That makes him an authority on movements
in the Territory?

611
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:16,503
We have battered a wild place.

612
00:38:17,014 --> 00:38:18,663
The men who were coming in,

613
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,733
wasn't any kind of supply.

614
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:23,255
Did not pick and choose the portal.

615
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:26,925
That is a piece of boogus.

616
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:29,275
All the snakes are asleep this time of year.

617
00:38:29,277 --> 00:38:30,898
They've been known to wake up.

618
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,086
Well let me have a rope, too.

619
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:34,014
Likely not bother you.

620
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,451
You are to little and boney.

621
00:38:37,313 --> 00:38:40,230
You should fetch the water.
Put it on the fire.

622
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:42,592
-First one out goes in.
-I'm not going down there again.

623
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,092
You want anymore water,
you can go fetch it yourself.

624
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:48,150
You're lucky to be traveling in a place
with a spring so handy.

625
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:52,320
In my country you could ride for days and
see no ground water.

626
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:55,394
I have lapped filthily water from a hoof print.

627
00:38:55,929 --> 00:38:57,067
And was glad to have it.

628
00:38:58,115 --> 00:39:00,485
If I believe one of you Texas boys.

629
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:03,224
Who says he had never drank
water out of a horse track'

630
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:06,097
I think I'd shake his hand and
give him the dandy wet sugar.

631
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:07,134
You do not believe it?

632
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:10,588
Oh, I believe it, the first twenty
thousand times I heard it.

633
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:13,675
Maybe, might be just true.

634
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,646
Maybe lapping water off the ground is
Ranger policy.

635
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,052
You're getting ready to show your ignorance
now, Cogburn.

636
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:22,650
I don't mind a little personal chaffing.

637
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:26,496
But I won't hear anything against the
Ranger troop from a man like you.

638
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,958
How long you boys been mounted
on sheep down there?

639
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,887
My white Appaloosa will still be galloping,

640
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:37,606
when that big American stud of yours
is winded and collapsed.

641
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:39,382
Now make another joke about it.

642
00:39:39,382 --> 00:39:42,034
You want to try to put on
a show for this girl, Mattie.

643
00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:44,367
With what you must think is a keen tongue.

644
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,735
This is like women talking.

645
00:39:46,737 --> 00:39:47,898
Yes, that is the way.

646
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,445
Make me out foolish in this girls eyes.

647
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:53,387
At least she has you pretty well figured.

648
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:03,570
Would you two like to hear the
story of the 'Midnight caller'?

649
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:07,175
One of you is gonna have to be the caller.

650
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:08,666
Now I'll tell you what to say.

651
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:11,110
Now I'll do all the other parts myself.

652
00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:37,409
-Good morning, Marshall.
-Morning.

653
00:40:37,956 --> 00:40:39,246
Where's Mr. La Boeuf?

654
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:42,144
Down by the creek performing his necessaries.

655
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:46,135
Marshall Cogburn, I welcome
the chance for a private parley.

656
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:49,876
I gather that you and Mr. La Boeuf have come to some,

657
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,085
some sort of agreement.

658
00:40:51,085 --> 00:40:53,981
And as your employer I believe
I have the right to know the particulars.

659
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:55,184
Particulars?

660
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,322
Is that we're bring Chaney down
to the magistrate,

661
00:40:58,324 --> 00:41:03,146
and since I'm with Texas wherein there's a
considerable reward on him for which we split.

662
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:06,253
I did not want him brought to Texas,

663
00:41:06,253 --> 00:41:09,117
to have a Texas punishment administered
for a Texas crime.

664
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:11,030
That was not our agreement.

665
00:41:11,275 --> 00:41:14,090
What you want is to have him caught
and punished.

666
00:41:14,094 --> 00:41:16,918
I want him to know he's being punished
for killing my father.

667
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,128
Well, you can let him know that.
You can tell him to his face.

668
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,925
You can spit on him.

669
00:41:21,925 --> 00:41:24,766
Or I can make a meat saddle out of him.
I can hold him down.

670
00:41:25,054 --> 00:41:26,619
I'll tell you what.

671
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:29,300
I'll flay the flesh off the souls of his feet.

672
00:41:29,302 --> 00:41:31,887
Find you Indian pepper you
can rub in his wound.

673
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,831
Isn't that a hundred dollar value?

674
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:35,172
No, it is not.

675
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,585
When I have brought and paid for
something, I will have my way.

676
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,105
Why do you think I'm paying you,
if not to have my way.

677
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:42,588
You will learn.

678
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,152
You cannot have your way.

679
00:41:44,152 --> 00:41:45,811
In every little particular.

680
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:48,681
You find I failed to satisfied your terms.

681
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:51,847
I'll return your money at the end
of this expedition.

682
00:41:51,847 --> 00:41:55,085
Little Blackie and I are ridding back
to the U.S. Marshall's office, this is fraud.

683
00:41:55,085 --> 00:41:56,092
What ever.

684
00:41:56,094 --> 00:41:57,434
What's going on?

685
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:59,494
This is a business conversation.

686
00:41:59,496 --> 00:42:00,574
Is that what you call it?

687
00:42:00,576 --> 00:42:03,340
Sounds to me you're still being
hoo-rod by a little girl.

688
00:42:03,342 --> 00:42:05,367
-You say, hoo-rod?
-That was the point.

689
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:07,760
There is no hoo-rahing.
In my agreement with the Marshall,

690
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,476
anti-dates you. It has the force of law.

691
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:10,668
The force of law?

692
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:13,561
This man is a notorious thumper.

693
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:16,123
He rode by the light of the moon with Quantrill.

694
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:19,637
-Bloody Phil Amers.
-Them men were patriots, Texas trash.

695
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,501
They murdered women and children
in Lawrence Kansas.

696
00:42:21,503 --> 00:42:23,190
That's a God damn lie!

697
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:25,797
What army was you in, Mister?

698
00:42:25,798 --> 00:42:26,903
I was at Treeport.

699
00:42:26,903 --> 00:42:28,664
First with Kirby Smith, then with...

700
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,429
What side was you on?

701
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:32,610
I was in the army of Northern Virginia, Cogburn.

702
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,548
And I don't have to hang my head
when I say it.

703
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,811
If  you served with Captain Quantrill.

704
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:39,454
Captain!
Captain Quantrill.

705
00:42:39,454 --> 00:42:41,188
That...indeed.

706
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,311
-Just let this go, La Boeuf.
-Captain of what?

707
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:48,889
We're done.

708
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:51,228
There's not sufficient dollars in the state of Texas,

709
00:42:51,228 --> 00:42:53,820
to make it worth my while to
listen to your business.

710
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,291
Our agreement is nullified.

711
00:42:55,293 --> 00:42:56,304
That suits me.

712
00:42:56,929 --> 00:42:58,425
See's man for himself.

713
00:42:58,427 --> 00:43:00,072
Congratulations, Cogburn.

714
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:03,492
You've graduated from a rotter,
to a wet nurse.

715
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:07,543
A-dios.

716
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,981
We don't need him, do we Marshall?

717
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,498
Gonna miss his sharp Carbine.

718
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:23,235
'Cept you'd get lock jaw.

719
00:43:46,282 --> 00:43:47,282
HEY!

720
00:43:50,072 --> 00:43:51,072
Go on.

721
00:43:58,567 --> 00:43:59,974
You stay here, sister.

722
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,768
And I'm going to sit back.

723
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:25,489
Has Chaney been here?

724
00:44:25,489 --> 00:44:26,686
No.

725
00:44:26,686 --> 00:44:28,860
Cole Cade was, two days ago.

726
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:30,887
Cole rides with Lucky Ned.

727
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:32,510
Brought supplies with this.

728
00:44:36,061 --> 00:44:37,585
Well this is Papa's gold piece.

729
00:44:37,867 --> 00:44:39,668
Tom Chaney here we come.

730
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,233
Not that rare, a California gold piece.

731
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:44,010
They are rare here.

732
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:45,201
How rare?

733
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:47,543
What if it is, Chaney's?

734
00:44:47,543 --> 00:44:49,971
Just as easily came upon a lucky nugget

735
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:52,438
Gang fell upon them as he fell into them.

736
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:54,666
Chaney could be a corpse.

737
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:57,768
That would be a bitter disappointment
Marshall, what would we do?

738
00:44:57,768 --> 00:44:59,293
Um, pursue them.

739
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:04,271
Ned's unfinished business for the Marshall's anyhow.
We have him, we'll also have Chaney.

740
00:45:04,273 --> 00:45:06,331
Wouldn't know the whereabouts
of his body.

741
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,791
Bagget didn't know which way they went.

742
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,585
now that we know they come through here.

743
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:12,418
They couldn't have gone but one or two ways.

744
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,735
Heading north, towards the winding stairs mountains.

745
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:17,563
Push them further west.

746
00:45:18,746 --> 00:45:20,548
I expect north, over all.

747
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:22,438
I found an eating place.

748
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,684
Called the 'Green frog'.

749
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,344
Started calling myself, burro.

750
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,695
But my drinkings picked up.

751
00:45:28,706 --> 00:45:32,443
My wife did not care for the company
of my river friends.

752
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:35,295
She decided to go back to her fist husband.

753
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:37,349
Clerk in a hardware store.

754
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,829
That was when she said,
Goodbye Ruben.

755
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,422
Loved the beefing season,
could not abid it here.

756
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:48,335
First divorced woman that,
talked about beefing season.

757
00:45:48,336 --> 00:45:50,882
I told her, goodbye Molo.

758
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:54,282
Hope that little mail son of a bastard
will keep you happy this time.

759
00:45:54,282 --> 00:45:56,889
She took my boy with her too.

760
00:45:57,898 --> 00:46:00,378
He never cared for me anyway.

761
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:04,199
I guess I did speak awful rough to him.

762
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,097
I did not mean anything by it.

763
00:46:07,947 --> 00:46:10,777
When it comes to your child .

764
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,009
I bet he broke before he cut.

765
00:46:43,706 --> 00:46:45,038
Is it, Chaney?

766
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:48,222
I would not recognize the
souls of his feet.

767
00:46:48,547 --> 00:46:51,885
Well, you'll have to clamber up and look.

768
00:46:52,764 --> 00:46:54,344
I'm to old and to fat.

769
00:46:54,905 --> 00:46:57,913
Now the Green Frog had one billiard table.

770
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,583
Complained that I had bad ball.

771
00:47:02,217 --> 00:47:04,387
Most of the time, had been
running it for myself for a while,

772
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,351
to keep good health.

773
00:47:06,777 --> 00:47:09,065
Never did learn how to buy meat.

774
00:47:10,248 --> 00:47:11,416
That him?

775
00:47:12,322 --> 00:47:13,420
I believe not.

776
00:47:13,425 --> 00:47:15,128
Well, cut him down.

777
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:16,516
Why?

778
00:47:16,998 --> 00:47:18,199
I might know him.

779
00:47:22,052 --> 00:47:24,655
Last time I went out to the
state plains of Texas.

780
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:29,719
Shoot buffaloes with a camp chaplain and
a tribe Indian name Malle.

781
00:47:30,103 --> 00:47:34,246
Now the Mormons. They run a
shelter down the great Salt Lake city.

782
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,708
Never asked me before.

783
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,179
Thought it was a misunderstanding
and leave it go at that.

784
00:47:40,822 --> 00:47:43,898
Well, the Chinese.

785
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,547
They'll all gone now.

786
00:47:45,548 --> 00:47:46,567
Didn't see them.

787
00:47:48,003 --> 00:47:51,490
Give three dollars right now for
pickled buffalo tongues.

788
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,382
Why did they hang him so high?

789
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:58,288
Probably do something awful.

790
00:47:58,846 --> 00:48:01,623
Must play in the belief
it'll make him more dead.

791
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:17,248
I do not know this man.

792
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:49,826
You hanged him?

793
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:58,862
Why did he take the hanged man?

794
00:48:58,864 --> 00:49:00,373
Did he know him?

795
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:01,880
He did not.

796
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:04,500
But it is a dead body.

797
00:49:04,824 --> 00:49:07,110
Must be worth something in the trade.

798
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:09,934
Now my second wife, Edna.

799
00:49:09,936 --> 00:49:12,434
She got the notion. She wanted
me to be a lawyer.

800
00:49:12,737 --> 00:49:16,237
Bought this heavy book on Daniel
and negotionable instruments.

801
00:49:16,237 --> 00:49:17,931
Set to make me reading it.

802
00:49:17,931 --> 00:49:21,163
Never could get a grip on it.

803
00:49:21,164 --> 00:49:24,378
I was happy enough to set it aside and leave Texas.

804
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:30,311
There ain't six trees between here and Canada,
Nothing else grows that has stickers on it.

805
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:32,376
Ask them...

806
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,809
-I knew it.
-Knew what?

807
00:49:37,217 --> 00:49:38,492
We're being followed.

808
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:43,085
I asked that injun to signal me a shot
if someone was on our trail.

809
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:46,677
Should we be concerned, Marshall?

810
00:49:46,677 --> 00:49:50,777
Naw, Mr. La Boeuf is giving us
his bird dog.

811
00:49:50,778 --> 00:49:53,333
He wants to cut it in, once it flushed his prey.

812
00:49:54,346 --> 00:49:59,324
Perhaps we could double back over our
tracks and confuse the trail in a clever way.

813
00:49:59,326 --> 00:50:02,141
No, we will wait right here.

814
00:50:03,302 --> 00:50:05,682
Offer our friend a warm hello.

815
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:07,601
Ask him where he's going.

816
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:05,000
You are not La Boeuf.

817
00:51:06,632 --> 00:51:09,038
My name is Forrester.

818
00:51:09,791 --> 00:51:11,161
I practice,

819
00:51:11,556 --> 00:51:13,679
Dentistry in the nation.

820
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:15,557
Also veterinary arts.

821
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:17,724
And medicine.

822
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:21,398
On those humans that will sit still for it.

823
00:51:22,027 --> 00:51:24,753
You have your work cut out for you there.

824
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,001
Traded for him with an Indian who said he
came by him honestly.

825
00:51:32,534 --> 00:51:37,726
I gave up two dental mirrors
and a bottle of expectorant.

826
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,369
Do either of you need

827
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:44,068
Medical redemption?

828
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:48,478
No, claim. fixing to get cold.

829
00:51:48,478 --> 00:51:50,688
You  know of anywhere to take shelter?

830
00:51:51,172 --> 00:51:53,460
I have my bear skin.

831
00:51:58,413 --> 00:52:02,570
You might want to head over
to the Original Crazy Bob.

832
00:52:03,295 --> 00:52:08,474
He launched a dug out in the hollow
along the Carolina river.

833
00:52:09,074 --> 00:52:12,027
If you ride the river.

834
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:14,106
You won't fail to see it.

835
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:16,954
Crazy Bob, the original.

836
00:52:16,956 --> 00:52:18,570
Crazy Bob.

837
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:21,344
There's  nothing north of the picket wire.

838
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:25,360
They would not give refuge.

839
00:52:25,987 --> 00:52:29,637
-Much obliged.
-Now, I have taken his teeth.

840
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:33,655
I will entertain an offer,

841
00:52:33,655 --> 00:52:35,353
for the rest of him.

842
00:52:43,947 --> 00:52:45,438
Take my jacket.

843
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,534
Creep up on the roof.

844
00:52:50,197 --> 00:52:53,349
If they're unfriendly I'll give you a sign
to damp the chimney.

845
00:53:18,074 --> 00:53:19,742
Who is out there?

846
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:21,869
We're looking for shelter.

847
00:53:22,675 --> 00:53:25,762
There's nothing here, go on.

848
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:28,867
Whos' in there?

849
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:12,250
I'm a federal officer.

850
00:54:12,251 --> 00:54:13,338
Who's in there?

851
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,123
It's a son of a bitch.

852
00:54:16,474 --> 00:54:18,157
This is Rooster Cogburn.

853
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:22,242
Columbus Potter and five other Marshalls
is out here with me.

854
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,913
We got a bucket of coal oil.

855
00:54:24,914 --> 00:54:27,632
In one minute we will burn your
house from both ends.

856
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:29,273
There's only two of you.

857
00:54:29,418 --> 00:54:31,605
Go ahead and bet your life on it.

858
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:33,561
How many of you is in there?

859
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:34,653
Just the two of us.

860
00:54:34,784 --> 00:54:36,248
But my partner's hit.

861
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,313
And he can't walk.

862
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:40,699
Is that Emmet Quincy?

863
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,980
You said it was a man on the roof.

864
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:03,423
I thought it was Potter.

865
00:55:03,788 --> 00:55:07,333
It has always been Quincy that I
might be true to form.

866
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:09,963
Seems an awful lot of salt beef.

867
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:12,878
You boys looking for company?

868
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:16,222
No, that was supper and breakfast both.

869
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:17,972
I like a big breakfast.

870
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:22,195
South bounds always cooks up
bigger than they think.

871
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:24,764
Hmm, you keep store whiskey here as well.

872
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,597
What are you boys up to outside
of cooking for banquets?

873
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:30,072
We're just having our supper.

874
00:55:30,074 --> 00:55:32,603
Not even a hooter's outside in weather like this.

875
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:34,708
Might have been some crazy man.

876
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:36,782
Anyone can say that he is a Marshall.

877
00:55:36,782 --> 00:55:37,887
My leg hurts.

878
00:55:37,889 --> 00:55:39,822
I bet it does.

879
00:55:44,905 --> 00:55:48,027
When was the last time you see
your ol' pard, Ned Pepper?

880
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:51,264
I do not know that.
Who is he?

881
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:53,724
I'm surprised you don't remember him.

882
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:57,371
Skinny fellow, wears a recent quid,
face all messed up.

883
00:55:58,161 --> 00:56:00,186
That don't bring anybody to mind.

884
00:56:00,186 --> 00:56:01,585
There's a new boy.

885
00:56:02,769 --> 00:56:04,822
Might be running with Ned.

886
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:08,472
He'll have a palming mark on his face,
black polish.

887
00:56:08,673 --> 00:56:10,322
Call's himself Chaney.

888
00:56:10,322 --> 00:56:12,298
He's Chelmsford sometimes.

889
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:14,750
Carries a Henry rifle.

890
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:16,967
That don't bring anybody to mind.

891
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:19,289
Black mark, I would remember that.

892
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:22,431
You don't remember nothing
right now, do you Quincy?

893
00:56:24,043 --> 00:56:25,467
What do you know, Moon?

894
00:56:25,467 --> 00:56:27,570
He don't know those boys you're
looking for.

895
00:56:27,733 --> 00:56:29,943
I don't know those boys.

896
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:33,275
I always try to help out the law.

897
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,675
Know by the time I get to Fort Smith,

898
00:56:35,677 --> 00:56:39,097
that leg will be swelled up as tight
as this hat band.

899
00:56:39,451 --> 00:56:40,954
It'll be mortified.

900
00:56:40,956 --> 00:56:42,782
Then they'll have to cut it off.

901
00:56:42,782 --> 00:56:46,003
Then if you live, I'll make it two or
three years in the federal house.

902
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:48,179
-Up in Detroit, there.
-I'm trying give up.

903
00:56:48,181 --> 00:56:50,204
They'll teach you how to read
an write up there.

904
00:56:51,545 --> 00:56:53,407
The rest won't be so good.

905
00:56:53,219 --> 00:56:56,217
Them boys, they can be
hard on a gimp.

906
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:57,291
Trying to get at me.

907
00:56:57,291 --> 00:56:58,311
Now.

908
00:56:58,902 --> 00:57:01,547
You give me some good information
on Ned.

909
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:05,577
I'll take you down to the back of the store tomorrow,
I'll get that ball taken out of your leg.

910
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:08,228
Then I'll give you three days to
clear the territory.

911
00:57:08,228 --> 00:57:10,039
We don't know those boys
you're looking for.

912
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:14,563
-It ain't even his leg.
-I was...

913
00:57:14,563 --> 00:57:17,077
Quiet now, it's best you let me do the talking.

914
00:57:17,077 --> 00:57:18,670
-I'll say I...
-We, weary trackers.

915
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,925
Who worked you over with the ugly stick?

916
00:57:22,925 --> 00:57:25,621
The man Chaney with the marked face,
killed my father.

917
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:28,914
It was a whiskey drinker like you
and I rather kill him in the end.

918
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:32,724
If you answer the Marshall's questions,
he will help you.

919
00:57:32,726 --> 00:57:34,985
I have a good lawyer, and I know
he will help you too.

920
00:57:36,233 --> 00:57:37,860
I'm puzzled by this.

921
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,543
Why is she here?

922
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:43,101
Joe, these people. Don't you be
jawing with that girl.

923
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:46,884
I don't like you. I hope you go to jail
my lawyer will not help you.

924
00:57:46,885 --> 00:57:48,766
My leg is giving me fits.

925
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:51,331
A young fellow like don't want to loose his leg.

926
00:57:51,331 --> 00:57:52,768
-Moon, he's lying.
-Is he now.

927
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,106
He's trying to get at you.

928
00:57:54,106 --> 00:57:56,521
-With the truth.
-We seen Ned and Hays two days ago.

929
00:57:56,521 --> 00:57:59,074
Don't you act the fool,
you go on I will kill you.

930
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:00,782
I'm played out, I need a doctor.

931
00:58:00,784 --> 00:58:02,675
We met Nate Hayes two days ago.

932
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,012
God damn it.

933
00:58:26,427 --> 00:58:27,545
Oh Lord.

934
00:58:28,514 --> 00:58:29,679
I'm dying.

935
00:58:31,998 --> 00:58:33,070
Do something.

936
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,327
Help me.

937
00:58:34,956 --> 00:58:36,628
I can do nothing for you, son.

938
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:39,668
You partner's killed you, as I done for him.

939
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,570
Don't leave me lying here.

940
00:58:42,193 --> 00:58:44,074
Don't let the wolves rip me up.

941
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:46,079
I'll see you're buried right.

942
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,175
You talking about Ned, where'd you see him?

943
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,501
Two days ago.

944
00:58:50,503 --> 00:58:51,775
Babbett's store.

945
00:58:52,534 --> 00:58:56,228
They were coming here tonight to get remounts.

946
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,958
They just wired, wagon wheelers switch.

947
00:59:01,748 --> 00:59:03,322
I'm gone.

948
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:08,822
Send the news to my brother, George Garrett.

949
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:12,856
He is Methodist Circuit rider south Texas.

950
00:59:12,856 --> 00:59:15,344
Shall I tell him you've outlawed up.

951
00:59:15,346 --> 00:59:16,481
It don't matter.

952
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:18,690
He knows I'm under skilled.

953
00:59:20,614 --> 00:59:23,860
I will meet him later, walking
the streets of glory.

954
00:59:25,376 --> 00:59:27,737
Well don't be looking for Quincy.

955
00:59:40,371 --> 00:59:41,559
What will we do when they get here?

956
00:59:41,561 --> 00:59:43,094
Well they will ride up.

957
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:45,425
Hope we get them all in the dugout.

958
00:59:46,284 --> 00:59:49,431
I'll kill them the last one that goes in,
that way we'll have them in the barrow.

959
00:59:49,876 --> 00:59:51,092
You will shoot them in the back?

960
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:54,023
Mmm, will give them the know
our intention is serious.

961
00:59:54,548 --> 00:59:56,005
Then they'll fall down.

962
00:59:56,577 --> 00:59:58,740
See if they'll be taken alive.

963
00:59:59,351 --> 01:00:01,340
If they want.

964
01:00:01,342 --> 01:00:03,027
I'll shoot them if they come out.

965
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:07,889
I'm hoping that three of the party
dead will take the spark out of them.

966
01:00:10,572 --> 01:00:12,230
You just play great place.

967
01:00:15,021 --> 01:00:16,889
Aw, I just triple shooten.

968
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:22,498
One time, into Mexico,

969
01:00:22,947 --> 01:00:25,478
we was being pursued by seven men.

970
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,711
I turned bolt around and taken them
reins in my teeth,

971
01:00:28,713 --> 01:00:32,634
rode right up them boys. Fired up them
two eighty-sixes I carry in my saddle.

972
01:00:33,581 --> 01:00:34,586
Well..

973
01:00:35,237 --> 01:00:39,697
I guess there's old married men who loved their
families as they scattered and run from them.

974
01:00:40,295 --> 01:00:41,715
Well that is hard to believe.

975
01:00:41,715 --> 01:00:44,351
-Was it?
-A man riding at seven.

976
01:00:44,351 --> 01:00:45,791
Well, it's true.

977
01:00:46,157 --> 01:00:48,699
You go for a man hard enough and fast enough,

978
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:52,688
You're don't have time to think about how
many women, he would think about himself.

979
01:00:53,137 --> 01:00:56,175
I might get clear of that rat that's
about to sit down on you.

980
01:00:57,581 --> 01:00:58,668
Why were they pursuing you?

981
01:01:01,927 --> 01:01:03,739
I robbed a high interest bank.

982
01:01:04,759 --> 01:01:06,510
Can't rob a thief, can you.

983
01:01:07,547 --> 01:01:09,077
Never robbed a citizen.

984
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:10,519
Never took a mans watch.

985
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:11,519
It is all stealing.

986
01:01:12,099 --> 01:01:14,719
That's the position they took
in New Mexico.

987
01:01:26,945 --> 01:01:28,422
Wasn't them.

988
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:31,853
Do not fear them to send a scout.

989
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,677
Damn.

990
01:01:55,632 --> 01:01:57,940
It is La Boeuf.

991
01:02:03,556 --> 01:02:05,460
Oh, we have to warn him, Marshall.

992
01:02:13,492 --> 01:02:14,492
Too late.

993
01:02:44,931 --> 01:02:46,467
What will we do, Marshall?

994
01:02:46,907 --> 01:02:49,233
We sit, what does he do.

995
01:03:08,815 --> 01:03:11,661
Maybe they want to chat.
That's Lucky's men.

996
01:03:22,103 --> 01:03:23,561
Oh, that's that.

997
01:04:16,344 --> 01:04:18,065
Well that didn't pan out.

998
01:04:25,442 --> 01:04:27,827
You managed to put a kink
in my rope, partner.

999
01:04:29,259 --> 01:04:31,173
Ah, I'm severely injured.

1000
01:04:31,175 --> 01:04:33,148
Yes, you got rocks on.

1001
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,809
I was also shot.

1002
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:36,438
By a rifle.

1003
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:39,822
Well thats because my scheme
did not developed as well as I planned.

1004
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:44,514
You've been shot in the shoulder,
but the bullet passed through.

1005
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,242
What happened to your mouth?

1006
01:04:47,126 --> 01:04:49,057
I believe I bit myself.

1007
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:52,362
Couple of teeth loose, and ah yeah.

1008
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,994
Tongue bit almost through.

1009
01:04:54,994 --> 01:04:57,742
I see it's a little nip
so I'll just yank it free.

1010
01:04:58,206 --> 01:04:59,637
I know a teamster.

1011
01:04:59,639 --> 01:05:01,628
Bit his tongue off as he was thrown
from a horse.

1012
01:05:01,628 --> 01:05:04,715
After a time he learned to make
seven or less noises understood.

1013
01:05:04,715 --> 01:05:05,807
I'll just yank it free.

1014
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:08,987
Look at that now.

1015
01:05:09,715 --> 01:05:10,876
What's that now?

1016
01:05:10,878 --> 01:05:12,771
Let it be a bit.

1017
01:05:12,773 --> 01:05:13,878
Ah, very well.

1018
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:17,168
It's impossible to bind
a tongue wound.

1019
01:05:17,168 --> 01:05:19,878
To bad, we just run across a Doctor.

1020
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,681
-Marshall?
-Forrester, but he did not know where
he was headed.

1021
01:05:22,681 --> 01:05:24,938
I saw him too, that's how I intend
to be here.

1022
01:05:25,891 --> 01:05:27,590
Neither of these men are Chaney.

1023
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:29,764
I know it, I know them both.

1024
01:05:30,402 --> 01:05:32,394
That ugly one is Poke Hayes.

1025
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:35,465
And the uglier stiff is Clement Permalee

1026
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:39,905
Permalee and his brothers have a silver
claim in winding stair mountains.

1027
01:05:39,905 --> 01:05:42,438
And I bet that's where Lucky Ned's gang is riding.

1028
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,818
Well, we'll sleep here.

1029
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,230
We'll follow in the morning.

1030
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:47,657
But we promised to bury
the poor soul inside.

1031
01:05:47,804 --> 01:05:49,264
Grounds to hard.

1032
01:05:49,757 --> 01:05:53,648
That man wanted a decent burial,
he should have gotten himself killed in summer.

1033
01:05:58,199 --> 01:05:59,903
Sleep well, Little Blackie.

1034
01:05:59,907 --> 01:06:02,967
I have a notion that tomorrow we will
reach our object.

1035
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:05,125
We're hot on the trail.

1036
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:09,219
Seems that we'll overtake Tom
Chaney at winding stairs mountain.

1037
01:06:10,016 --> 01:06:11,755
I had not want to be in his shoes.

1038
01:06:23,918 --> 01:06:26,981
Chelmsford, as he called himself in Texas.

1039
01:06:27,286 --> 01:06:28,914
Shot the Senator's dog.

1040
01:06:29,173 --> 01:06:31,315
When the Senator remonstrated.

1041
01:06:31,317 --> 01:06:32,802
Chelmsford shot him as well.

1042
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:38,175
Now you could argue that the shooting of
the dog was clearly an instance of mali-prohibited.

1043
01:06:38,177 --> 01:06:41,956
But the shooting of the Senator is indubitably
a instance of mailicide.

1044
01:06:42,282 --> 01:06:44,023
A double and mali-what?

1045
01:06:44,023 --> 01:06:45,349
Neither of them safe.

1046
01:06:45,351 --> 01:06:48,634
The distinction is between an
act that is wrong within itself.

1047
01:06:48,635 --> 01:06:51,914
And an act that is wrong according
to our laws and rights.

1048
01:06:51,914 --> 01:06:53,086
It is Latin.

1049
01:06:54,518 --> 01:06:56,148
I'm struck.

1050
01:06:56,335 --> 01:06:57,021
Hey, La Boeuf.

1051
01:06:57,025 --> 01:07:01,820
I've been shot, trampled.
But he has severed his tongue.

1052
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:07,326
Not only does he not cease to talk.
But he spills the banks of English.

1053
01:07:12,184 --> 01:07:15,219
I was within three hundred yards of
Tom Chaney.

1054
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:18,117
The closest I have been.

1055
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:21,614
With a sharps carbine that is within range.

1056
01:07:22,065 --> 01:07:26,327
But I was not,
I had the choice of firing off hand.

1057
01:07:26,329 --> 01:07:28,306
Resist Theron and shoot the rest.

1058
01:07:28,307 --> 01:07:31,255
Just relax once I dogged him, the distance.

1059
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:34,429
I fired at him.

1060
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,001
He fired back.

1061
01:07:42,612 --> 01:07:47,445
You cannot  hit a man three hundred yards
if your gun was resting on your boulders.

1062
01:07:48,108 --> 01:07:51,740
A soft carbine is an instrument of
uncanny balance and precision.

1063
01:07:51,742 --> 01:07:54,530
I've no doubt that the gun is sound.

1064
01:07:55,655 --> 01:08:00,059
<i>(Sings "Greer County")
*My clothes are all ragged and my language is rough.*</i>

1065
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:04,730
<i>*My bread is corn dodgers,
both solid and tough*</i>

1066
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:09,547
<i>*And yet I'm happy, and live at my ease*</i>

1067
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:13,864
<i>*On sorghum molasses, and bacon, and cheese*</i>

1068
01:08:13,865 --> 01:08:16,128
Greer county bantler.

1069
01:08:19,485 --> 01:08:21,090
I do not believe he slept.

1070
01:08:29,373 --> 01:08:31,993
Your minced, and helping, Mister La Boeuf.

1071
01:08:31,994 --> 01:08:34,177
and I would have turned the preacher you had

1072
01:08:34,179 --> 01:08:38,654
to head southward. Out here
a one-armed man look like an easy prey.

1073
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,194
And a one eyed man who can't shoot.

1074
01:08:42,194 --> 01:08:44,143
Why don't you turn back, Cogburn?

1075
01:08:44,145 --> 01:08:45,426
I'll do fine.

1076
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:52,342
I know what a parity claim is. I'm uninjured,
well provisioned and we agree to separate.

1077
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:56,685
In confidence you cannot shy our agreement.
You're the one that shot me.

1078
01:08:56,685 --> 01:08:58,733
Mr. La Boeuf has a point, Marshall.

1079
01:08:58,739 --> 01:09:02,238
It is unfair leg up in any competition
to shoot your opposite member.

1080
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:05,966
God damn it. I do not accept as
a given that I did shoot La Boeuf.

1081
01:09:05,966 --> 01:09:07,989
There were plenty of guns going off.

1082
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:10,378
I heard the rifle, and I felt the ball.

1083
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,234
You missed your shot, Cogburn.

1084
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:13,634
Missed my shot!

1085
01:09:13,635 --> 01:09:17,407
You are handicapped without the eye,
then I without the arm.

1086
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:20,224
I can hit a gnat's eye at ninety yards.

1087
01:09:31,796 --> 01:09:34,686
That timing man has brung
the cheap shells on me again.

1088
01:09:34,689 --> 01:09:37,027
I thought you were going to say,
the sun was in your eyes.

1089
01:09:37,677 --> 01:09:40,331
That is to say, "your eye".

1090
01:10:25,025 --> 01:10:26,635
Two at one time.

1091
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:43,488
I'm going to chuck one high.

1092
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:44,663
Go far.

1093
01:10:53,231 --> 01:10:55,434
-There.
-There?

1094
01:10:55,435 --> 01:10:57,609
-My bullet.
-Your bullet?

1095
01:10:57,613 --> 01:11:00,573
If you hit what you aim at,
explain my shoulder.

1096
01:11:00,574 --> 01:11:04,617
Gentlemen, shooting corn bread out on the prairie
is getting us no closer to the Pepper gang.

1097
01:11:04,618 --> 01:11:07,056
One more. This will prove it.

1098
01:11:07,057 --> 01:11:08,738
Please hold fire.

1099
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:35,557
Find our way back.

1100
01:12:50,895 --> 01:12:51,895
Lucky Ned?

1101
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:04,764
LUCKY NED!

1102
01:13:07,271 --> 01:13:08,979
Very good, Cogburn.

1103
01:13:08,979 --> 01:13:10,277
Now what?

1104
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:18,225
Oh, god damn it.

1105
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,768
Cogburn you might want to be
eating out of a store.

1106
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:24,672
I'm assuming you might be hungry.
And it was my store not...

1107
01:13:24,673 --> 01:13:26,296
Let him starve.

1108
01:13:28,277 --> 01:13:29,981
He did not track.

1109
01:13:29,983 --> 01:13:31,154
He did not shoot.

1110
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:33,119
Accepting food stuffs.

1111
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:35,011
What is your initiative?

1112
01:13:35,012 --> 01:13:35,770
You talking tribute.

1113
01:13:36,313 --> 01:13:40,088
A man, who walks in front of bullets.

1114
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:42,838
Mr. La Boeuf drew single handed
upon the Lucky Ned Pepper gang.

1115
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,328
while we fired safely from cover.

1116
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,305
-We?
-It is unfair to indict a man,

1117
01:13:47,306 --> 01:13:51,712
when his jaw is swollen, and tongue mangled
and is therefore unable to rise to his defense.

1118
01:13:51,712 --> 01:13:53,024
I can speak for myself.

1119
01:13:53,332 --> 01:13:58,376
I'm courtly obliged to answer the ravings
of a drunkard who is beneath me.

1120
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:01,407
I shall  make my own camp.

1121
01:14:01,408 --> 01:14:03,453
Elsewhere.

1122
01:14:04,623 --> 01:14:07,346
It is you that has nothing to
offer, Cogburn.

1123
01:14:07,703 --> 01:14:09,588
A sad picture indeed.

1124
01:14:09,855 --> 01:14:11,913
This is no longer a man hunt.

1125
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:13,298
It is a debauch.

1126
01:14:13,831 --> 01:14:15,431
The Texas Ranger.

1127
01:14:15,432 --> 01:14:17,658
Presses on, alone.

1128
01:14:20,091 --> 01:14:21,423
Take the girl.

1129
01:14:21,425 --> 01:14:22,662
I bow out.

1130
01:14:25,305 --> 01:14:28,882
A fine thing to decide once you brought her
in the middle of the Choctaw nation.

1131
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:30,773
I bow out, I wash my hands.

1132
01:14:30,774 --> 01:14:32,795
Gentlemen we cannot fall out in this fashion.

1133
01:14:32,798 --> 01:14:35,717
Not so close to our goal, with
Tom Chaney nearly in hand.

1134
01:14:35,719 --> 01:14:37,828
Damn!

1135
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:42,271
I'm sure there's a silent grave
somewhere between here and Fort Smith.

1136
01:14:42,273 --> 01:14:43,636
He is gone.

1137
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:45,247
Long gone.

1138
01:14:45,878 --> 01:14:49,037
Thanks to Mr. La Boeuf, we missed our shot.

1139
01:14:49,435 --> 01:14:51,667
With Bob and the boys have flown.

1140
01:14:51,944 --> 01:14:53,712
Gone, gone, gone.

1141
01:14:54,064 --> 01:14:56,311
Lucky Ned's cohort gone.

1142
01:14:56,313 --> 01:14:58,097
Your fifty dollars, gone.

1143
01:14:58,099 --> 01:14:59,578
Gone with whiskey.

1144
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,341
Seems to know that.

1145
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:04,596
The trail is cold as is the weather.

1146
01:15:07,695 --> 01:15:13,939
I'm....I'm a foolish old man who'd been
drawn into a wild goose chase.

1147
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:18,369
by a harpy in trousers,
and a nincompoop.

1148
01:15:19,103 --> 01:15:21,752
Ah, Mr. La Boeuf.

1149
01:15:21,755 --> 01:15:24,945
He can wander the Choctaw nation
for as long as he likes.

1150
01:15:24,947 --> 01:15:27,439
Perhaps the local Indians will take him in.

1151
01:15:27,774 --> 01:15:30,514
Honor his .. by making him Chief.

1152
01:15:31,644 --> 01:15:34,250
You sift her, and go where you like.

1153
01:15:35,118 --> 01:15:37,524
Our engagement is terminated.

1154
01:15:39,617 --> 01:15:40,962
I bow out.

1155
01:15:48,889 --> 01:15:49,984
I'm going with you.

1156
01:15:50,309 --> 01:15:52,430
No, that is not possible.

1157
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,135
Have I held you back?

1158
01:15:54,893 --> 01:15:57,981
I have a colt in my wardrobe,
and I know how to use it.

1159
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,916
And I will be no more a burden to you,
as I was to the Marshall.

1160
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:02,182
That's not my worry.

1161
01:16:02,515 --> 01:16:04,488
You've earned your spurs.

1162
01:16:04,489 --> 01:16:05,604
That is clear now.

1163
01:16:06,265 --> 01:16:09,382
You've been an regular
old hand on the trail.

1164
01:16:10,626 --> 01:16:12,310
But Cogburn's right.

1165
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:15,164
I will not give him the satisfaction
of saying it.

1166
01:16:16,811 --> 01:16:18,347
The trail is cold.

1167
01:16:19,947 --> 01:16:21,605
And I am,

1168
01:16:22,561 --> 01:16:24,398
considerably diminished.

1169
01:16:24,778 --> 01:16:28,260
How can you give up now. After the many months
you've dedicated to finding Chaney?

1170
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:31,087
You have shown great determination.

1171
01:16:32,707 --> 01:16:34,119
I misjudged you.

1172
01:16:38,118 --> 01:16:39,560
I picked the wrong man.

1173
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:46,832
I would go on with your company,
if there were a clear way to go.

1174
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:50,851
But we'd be striking out blindly.

1175
01:16:52,581 --> 01:16:53,927
Chelmsford's gone.

1176
01:16:55,512 --> 01:16:57,405
We chased him right up the mountain.

1177
01:16:58,979 --> 01:17:00,275
There's nothing for him.

1178
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:06,229
I'm bound for Texas.

1179
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,457
Time for you to go home, too.

1180
01:17:10,695 --> 01:17:12,707
The Marshall, when he's sobers.

1181
01:17:14,371 --> 01:17:15,775
Bring your way back.

1182
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:18,591
I will not go back. Not without Chaney,
dead or alive.

1183
01:17:22,286 --> 01:17:24,064
I misjudged you as well.

1184
01:17:27,216 --> 01:17:28,797
I extend my hand.

1185
01:17:29,527 --> 01:17:31,046
Mr. La Boeuf, please.

1186
01:17:43,823 --> 01:17:45,328
Adios.

1187
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,134
I know you.

1188
01:19:38,514 --> 01:19:39,858
Your name is, Mattie.

1189
01:19:39,936 --> 01:19:42,283
You're little Mattie, the bookkeeper.

1190
01:19:42,283 --> 01:19:45,510
Isn't that something.

1191
01:19:45,511 --> 01:19:47,125
Yes, and I know you, Tom Chaney.

1192
01:19:50,128 --> 01:19:51,480
What you doing out here?

1193
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:53,136
Come to fetch some water.

1194
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,327
No, what are you doing in these mountains, here.

1195
01:19:55,328 --> 01:19:57,208
While I've not been formerly deputized,

1196
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:59,386
but I'm acting as an agent for,
Marshall Rooster Cogburn,

1197
01:19:59,386 --> 01:20:00,637
and Judge Fockers court.

1198
01:20:06,789 --> 01:20:08,954
I have come to take you back to Fort Smith.

1199
01:20:14,698 --> 01:20:16,386
Well I will not go.

1200
01:20:16,387 --> 01:20:17,391
How do you like that?

1201
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:20,576
There's a posse of officers up there
that will force you to go.

1202
01:20:21,027 --> 01:20:22,867
That is interesting news.

1203
01:20:22,868 --> 01:20:24,034
And how many is up there?

1204
01:20:24,524 --> 01:20:25,807
Right around fifty.

1205
01:20:26,216 --> 01:20:28,052
They're all well armed and they mean business.

1206
01:20:28,764 --> 01:20:32,065
What I want you to do now, is to come
over across the creek and come up on that hill.

1207
01:20:32,796 --> 01:20:36,161
I think I'll oblige the officers who's
come after me.

1208
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:39,064
Well if you refuse to go, then
I'll have to shoot you.

1209
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:40,734
Oh.

1210
01:20:40,734 --> 01:20:43,011
Well you'd better cock your piece.

1211
01:20:45,332 --> 01:20:46,368
All the way back.

1212
01:20:47,685 --> 01:20:49,945
-Throw lock
-I know how to do it.

1213
01:20:50,615 --> 01:20:51,882
You will not go with me?

1214
01:20:51,884 --> 01:20:53,377
Naw, it's just the other way around.

1215
01:20:53,377 --> 01:20:54,630
You're going with me.

1216
01:20:55,195 --> 01:20:56,195
I'm...AAAH!

1217
01:21:05,451 --> 01:21:07,519
Well I didn't think you'd do it.

1218
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,860
-What do you think now?
-One of my short ribs is broken.

1219
01:21:10,862 --> 01:21:13,269
You killed my father when he was trying to help you.

1220
01:21:13,692 --> 01:21:16,590
I have one of the gold pieces you stole
from him. Now give me the other.

1221
01:21:17,886 --> 01:21:17,886
-Things aren't going right for me.
-MATTIE!

1222
01:21:17,886 --> 01:21:19,360
I'm down here.

1223
01:21:19,362 --> 01:21:20,979
Now I'm shot by a child.

1224
01:21:20,979 --> 01:21:22,578
Chaney's taken into custody.

1225
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:30,118
Help me.

1226
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:31,144
MATTIE!

1227
01:21:34,091 --> 01:21:35,091
Marshall.

1228
01:21:42,036 --> 01:21:43,265
Look who's you got, fool.

1229
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:51,889
Bob, you go on up that hill, don't you stop.

1230
01:21:55,597 --> 01:21:56,692
What's down there?

1231
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,657
Marshall Cogburn and fifty more officers.

1232
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:07,502
You tell me another lie and I'll
stove your head in.

1233
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:09,527
Just the Marshall.

1234
01:22:11,252 --> 01:22:12,686
Rooster.

1235
01:22:14,801 --> 01:22:15,823
Cogburn!

1236
01:22:16,408 --> 01:22:17,671
You hear me?

1237
01:22:20,904 --> 01:22:22,550
You answer me, Rooster.

1238
01:22:23,722 --> 01:22:25,288
I will kill this girl.

1239
01:22:25,681 --> 01:22:26,996
You know I will do it.

1240
01:22:28,739 --> 01:22:32,068
She means nothing to me,
your the one I'm after for.

1241
01:22:32,069 --> 01:22:33,814
That is all very well.

1242
01:22:34,072 --> 01:22:36,219
Do you advise that I kill her?

1243
01:22:39,007 --> 01:22:40,827
Do what you think is best, Ned.

1244
01:22:40,829 --> 01:22:43,551
She's nothing to me but a lost child.

1245
01:22:46,653 --> 01:22:47,957
Think it over.

1246
01:22:47,957 --> 01:22:49,902
I have already thought it over.

1247
01:22:50,077 --> 01:22:52,336
You'll get buried double fast.

1248
01:22:52,337 --> 01:22:55,756
If I see you riding over
that bald ridge to the northwest.

1249
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,186
I will spare the girl.

1250
01:22:57,893 --> 01:22:59,426
You have five minutes.

1251
01:22:59,427 --> 01:23:02,203
They will be a party of Marshalls here
soon, Ned.

1252
01:23:02,204 --> 01:23:06,779
Let me have the girl and Chaney and I will
just leave you for two down.

1253
01:23:06,779 --> 01:23:08,516
To thin Rooster.

1254
01:23:08,518 --> 01:23:09,568
To thin.

1255
01:23:10,268 --> 01:23:11,997
Your five minutes is running.

1256
01:23:11,998 --> 01:23:13,590
No more talk.

1257
01:23:17,069 --> 01:23:18,503
Run up that hill.

1258
01:23:29,942 --> 01:23:32,228
Well, they taught moon.

1259
01:23:32,599 --> 01:23:34,225
Can I have some of that bacon?

1260
01:23:34,226 --> 01:23:35,320
You help yourself.

1261
01:23:35,823 --> 01:23:37,188
They'll soon be coffee.

1262
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:39,403
I do not drink Coffee yet, I am fourteen.

1263
01:23:40,112 --> 01:23:43,284
Well we do not have buttermilk,
and we do not have bread.

1264
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,159
We are poorly supplied.

1265
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:46,984
-Where she is.
-What are you doing here?

1266
01:23:46,984 --> 01:23:48,742
I aught to ring your scrawny neck.

1267
01:23:48,743 --> 01:23:49,819
You let that go.

1268
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,409
What happened, huh?

1269
01:23:53,414 --> 01:23:55,779
I will tell you, and you will see that
I'm in the right.

1270
01:23:55,779 --> 01:23:57,940
Tom Chaney there shot my father to death..

1271
01:23:57,942 --> 01:23:59,020
at Fort Smith and robbed him of..

1272
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:00,851
two gold pieces and stole his mare.

1273
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:04,158
I was informed of Mr. Cogburn to wit. And
hired him to find the murderer.

1274
01:24:04,426 --> 01:24:07,211
Moments ago I spotted Chaney watering the horses.

1275
01:24:07,215 --> 01:24:09,162
He had taken to charge and I shot him.

1276
01:24:09,993 --> 01:24:14,474
If I killed him I would not be now in this
fix, but my gun misfired.

1277
01:24:14,556 --> 01:24:15,601
That will do it.

1278
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:17,917
It will embarrass you every time.

1279
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,850
Most girls like to play pretty,
but you like guns, do ya?

1280
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:25,189
I do not care a thing in the world about guns.
If I did I would have one that worked.

1281
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:27,118
I was shot in an ambush, Ned.

1282
01:24:27,118 --> 01:24:30,082
Horses were drawn making noise, it was that officer that got me.

1283
01:24:30,082 --> 01:24:32,213
How can you sit there and tell such a big story?

1284
01:24:32,215 --> 01:24:34,970
That pit is a hundred feet deep,
and I will throw you in.

1285
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:37,217
While I leave you screaming in rot.

1286
01:24:37,219 --> 01:24:39,090
-Now how do you like that?
-I know why.

1287
01:24:39,091 --> 01:24:42,005
This man will not let you have your way. He's your boss
and you have to do as he tells you.

1288
01:24:43,195 --> 01:24:44,885
Ain't nothing going my way.

1289
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:48,012
Was that Rooster that waylaid
them night before last?

1290
01:24:48,015 --> 01:24:49,720
It was Marshall Cogburn and myself.

1291
01:24:50,095 --> 01:24:51,373
You and, Cogburn.

1292
01:24:52,306 --> 01:24:53,592
Quite the posse.

1293
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:13,349
Let us move, Ned.

1294
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:14,676
In good time, Bob.

1295
01:25:15,137 --> 01:25:16,719
What happened to Quincy and the kid?

1296
01:25:19,225 --> 01:25:20,265
They're both dead.

1297
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:24,323
It was very in the very middle of it,
it was a terrible thing to see.

1298
01:25:24,403 --> 01:25:26,261
Please, let us move, Ned.

1299
01:25:26,262 --> 01:25:27,796
Marshall's gone.

1300
01:25:27,796 --> 01:25:29,100
Do you need a good lawyer?

1301
01:25:29,631 --> 01:25:31,179
I need a good judge.

1302
01:25:32,162 --> 01:25:33,747
What happened to Poke Hayes?

1303
01:25:33,748 --> 01:25:35,355
The fellow shot off his horse.

1304
01:25:35,725 --> 01:25:37,099
Dead as well.

1305
01:25:37,886 --> 01:25:39,751
These declarations have come to an end.

1306
01:25:40,417 --> 01:25:43,261
Your friend Rooster does
not collect many prisoners.

1307
01:25:43,261 --> 01:25:44,487
He is not my friend.

1308
01:25:46,686 --> 01:25:49,039
Hes a bandy man in a carnage of mounts.

1309
01:25:49,297 --> 01:25:51,266
You do not varnish your opinion.

1310
01:25:52,135 --> 01:25:53,320
Are we off?

1311
01:25:53,322 --> 01:25:55,859
Let us cut up the winch from the cages line.

1312
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:57,689
They'll be time for that at the old place.

1313
01:25:57,970 --> 01:25:59,240
How about the mare?

1314
01:25:59,242 --> 01:26:00,488
Well, those aren't the plans.

1315
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:02,609
Unless I dug them out with a doctor.

1316
01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:03,931
-Move.
-Nope.

1317
01:26:03,932 --> 01:26:06,246
We can't chance with two men up
come from the brace.

1318
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:08,202
Found your way here with the girl.

1319
01:26:08,314 --> 01:26:10,171
We reach Miles house I'll send Harold

1320
01:26:10,172 --> 01:26:11,529
back with some fresh mounts.

1321
01:26:11,529 --> 01:26:12,899
We'll be out by dark.

1322
01:26:13,525 --> 01:26:14,769
We'll meet you at the old place.

1323
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:16,372
I do not like that.

1324
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,716
Let me ride with you, Ned.
Just out here anyway.

1325
01:26:19,717 --> 01:26:20,913
I was short a horse.

1326
01:26:20,914 --> 01:26:22,587
The Marshalls will come swarming.

1327
01:26:22,588 --> 01:26:24,176
Hours, if the come here at all.

1328
01:26:24,298 --> 01:26:25,805
They'll think that we've all gone.

1329
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:28,314
I am not staying here by myself
with, Tom Chaney.

1330
01:26:28,542 --> 01:26:29,783
That's the way I will have it.

1331
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:30,912
He will kill me.

1332
01:26:30,914 --> 01:26:34,354
You heard him say it. He's killed my father,
and now you will let him kill me.

1333
01:26:34,573 --> 01:26:36,065
He will do no such thing.

1334
01:26:36,212 --> 01:26:40,814
Tom. You know the cross in the cypress forest,
to the log Wheaton house.

1335
01:26:41,131 --> 01:26:43,559
When you mount it, you take
the girl and leave her there.

1336
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:45,130
You understand, Tom?

1337
01:26:45,314 --> 01:26:47,750
Any harm comes to that child,

1338
01:26:48,248 --> 01:26:49,381
you'll not get paid.

1339
01:26:52,048 --> 01:26:54,677
Harold, let me ride up with you.

1340
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,952
Harold, I will pay you fifty dollars out of my wage.

1341
01:26:58,953 --> 01:27:00,426
I am not happy.

1342
01:27:00,761 --> 01:27:02,546
Do the calf again, Harold.

1343
01:27:30,555 --> 01:27:32,100
Everything is against me.

1344
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,434
You have no reason to whine.

1345
01:27:35,454 --> 01:27:39,733
You act as the bandit Chief instructed
and no harm comes to me you'll get your wages.

1346
01:27:40,025 --> 01:27:43,832
Lucky Ned has left me alone. I am sure
to be caught. I'll be on foot.

1347
01:27:44,671 --> 01:27:47,524
Must think over my position
and how I may improve it.

1348
01:27:47,994 --> 01:27:50,319
Where's the second California gold piece?

1349
01:27:53,046 --> 01:27:54,398
What have you done with Papa's mare?

1350
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:55,685
Keep still.

1351
01:27:56,395 --> 01:27:58,192
Are you thinking about the old place?

1352
01:27:58,595 --> 01:28:00,648
Look here, if you let me go.

1353
01:28:00,649 --> 01:28:02,069
I will swear to an affidavit..

1354
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:06,003
and once you are brought to justice,
it may go easier on you.

1355
01:28:07,442 --> 01:28:09,472
I tell you I can do better.

1356
01:28:15,845 --> 01:28:17,962
I don't need your affidavit.

1357
01:28:23,635 --> 01:28:25,538
All I need is your silence.

1358
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:32,828
You followed a busybody like you.

1359
01:28:32,829 --> 01:28:35,333
To be honest, I do not regret
shooting him.

1360
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,609
He thought Tom Chaney was small.

1361
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:39,368
Humor me.

1362
01:28:39,368 --> 01:28:41,313
You will give me an affidavit.

1363
01:28:41,314 --> 01:28:43,270
You're all against me, everybody....

1364
01:28:49,234 --> 01:28:50,963
That is, Chelmsford.

1365
01:28:52,519 --> 01:28:54,912
Strange to be so close to him at last.

1366
01:28:55,301 --> 01:28:58,077
Mr. La Boeuf, how is it that you are here?

1367
01:28:58,695 --> 01:28:59,886
I heard a shot.

1368
01:29:00,055 --> 01:29:01,628
Went down to the river.

1369
01:29:02,266 --> 01:29:04,140
Cogburn outlined a plan.

1370
01:29:04,783 --> 01:29:06,574
Mind your foot, there's a pit there.

1371
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:08,532
His part,

1372
01:29:09,012 --> 01:29:10,636
I fear is rash.

1373
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,131
He returns for Lucky Ned.

1374
01:29:32,296 --> 01:29:33,545
Yo, Rooster!

1375
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:35,970
We will cross the road.

1376
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:38,720
This ford is ill advised.

1377
01:29:39,229 --> 01:29:40,944
He could not be dissuaded.

1378
01:29:40,945 --> 01:29:43,822
Well Ned, how many men is with the girl?

1379
01:29:44,364 --> 01:29:45,729
Just Chaney.

1380
01:29:45,729 --> 01:29:47,475
My will is enforced.

1381
01:29:47,831 --> 01:29:50,835
She was in excellent health,
when last I saw her.

1382
01:29:51,737 --> 01:29:55,689
Farrell, I want you and your brother
to stay clear.

1383
01:29:56,537 --> 01:29:58,052
Do it well, Proctor.

1384
01:29:58,362 --> 01:30:00,550
Have no interest in you today.

1385
01:30:01,685 --> 01:30:03,573
What is your intention, Rooster?

1386
01:30:03,948 --> 01:30:06,197
You think one eye follows a downfall?

1387
01:30:06,759 --> 01:30:09,448
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned.

1388
01:30:10,046 --> 01:30:13,997
Or see you hanged at Fort Smith
at Judge Parker's convenience.

1389
01:30:14,787 --> 01:30:16,253
Which will you have?

1390
01:30:17,182 --> 01:30:19,270
I call that, bold talk.

1391
01:30:19,454 --> 01:30:21,136
From a one-eyed fat man.

1392
01:30:25,788 --> 01:30:28,451
Feel your hand, you son of a bitch.

1393
01:30:43,599 --> 01:30:44,921
Shoot them Mr. La Boeuf.

1394
01:30:44,925 --> 01:30:47,198
To far, moving to fast.

1395
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,274
Well, Rooster?

1396
01:31:32,085 --> 01:31:33,680
I'm shot to pieces.

1397
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,024
Seems neither of us,

1398
01:31:37,485 --> 01:31:39,359
gets to see Judge Parker.

1399
01:32:01,426 --> 01:32:02,610
Wahooo!

1400
01:32:02,612 --> 01:32:04,471
Some bully shot.

1401
01:32:04,475 --> 01:32:06,527
That was four hundred yards at least.

1402
01:32:07,551 --> 01:32:08,551
Well,

1403
01:32:09,585 --> 01:32:11,635
the sharps carbine, is a...

1404
01:32:26,037 --> 01:32:27,756
Stand up, Tom Chaney.

1405
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:06,998
M...Mr. La Boeuf

1406
01:33:11,375 --> 01:33:12,614
Are you alive?

1407
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:27,230
Mr. La Boeuf!

1408
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,702
Mr. La Boeuf.

1409
01:34:35,521 --> 01:34:36,921
Mr. La Boeuf.

1410
01:34:40,668 --> 01:34:41,668
Are you there?

1411
01:34:42,703 --> 01:34:43,703
I'm here.

1412
01:34:43,704 --> 01:34:45,125
Can you clamber out?

1413
01:34:45,356 --> 01:34:46,356
I cannot.

1414
01:34:46,358 --> 01:34:47,844
There are snakes.

1415
01:34:47,845 --> 01:34:49,117
They awake?

1416
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:50,359
Not yet.

1417
01:35:03,565 --> 01:35:04,618
I'm bit.

1418
01:35:15,068 --> 01:35:16,614
Does Mr. La Boeuf survive?

1419
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:20,988
He did. Only a blow to the head
could silence only for a few short minutes.

1420
01:35:21,229 --> 01:35:22,345
Where you bit?

1421
01:35:28,154 --> 01:35:29,518
Look away, Mattie.

1422
01:35:56,425 --> 01:35:57,483
A heft.

1423
01:35:57,484 --> 01:35:58,962
Up with us.

1424
01:36:05,756 --> 01:36:08,027
Work it, La Boeuf pack her.

1425
01:36:09,643 --> 01:36:10,916
She's snake bit.

1426
01:36:13,807 --> 01:36:14,751
We're off.

1427
01:36:15,403 --> 01:36:17,257
I'll send help for you as soon as I can.

1428
01:36:17,587 --> 01:36:18,702
Don't wander off.

1429
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:21,287
We are not leaving him.

1430
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:24,765
If we don't get to Doc's, I says
you are not going to make it.

1431
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,282
I'm your debt for that shot, pard.

1432
01:36:27,283 --> 01:36:28,970
Never doubt a Texas Ranger.

1433
01:36:29,493 --> 01:36:30,500
Come on.

1434
01:36:32,152 --> 01:36:33,503
Ever stalwart.

1435
01:37:36,265 --> 01:37:37,390
We must stop.

1436
01:37:37,871 --> 01:37:39,555
Little Blackie is played out.

1437
01:37:40,667 --> 01:37:41,798
We've miles yet.

1438
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:44,667
Come on you.

1439
01:37:45,515 --> 01:37:46,515
NO!

1440
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:48,439
No.

1441
01:37:49,354 --> 01:37:50,761
That's it, come on now.

1442
01:37:51,832 --> 01:37:52,832
No, stop.

1443
01:38:14,226 --> 01:38:15,639
He's getting away.

1444
01:38:16,127 --> 01:38:17,384
Who's getting, sis?

1445
01:38:18,612 --> 01:38:19,612
Chaney.

1446
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:56,747
No.. NO!

1447
01:38:57,042 --> 01:38:58,815
NO, no, no.

1448
01:39:00,698 --> 01:39:01,798
Oh, no.

1449
01:39:07,384 --> 01:39:08,680
No, stop.

1450
01:40:35,927 --> 01:40:37,725
I've grown old.

1451
01:40:59,724 --> 01:41:02,082
(Grown up Mattie)
A quarter century is a long time.

1452
01:41:17,322 --> 01:41:19,256
By the time we reached Baglee's store,

1453
01:41:19,256 --> 01:41:20,891
my hand had turned black.

1454
01:41:21,751 --> 01:41:23,932
I was not awake when I lost the arm.

1455
01:41:27,318 --> 01:41:29,770
The Marshall had stayed with me, I was told.

1456
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:31,126
'til I was out of danger.

1457
01:41:31,506 --> 01:41:33,555
But he departed before I came around.

1458
01:41:34,466 --> 01:41:37,137
Once home. I wrote him with an invitation,

1459
01:41:37,139 --> 01:41:40,113
to come by, the next time he found
himself near Yell county.

1460
01:41:40,551 --> 01:41:43,204
And collect the fifty dollars I still owed him.

1461
01:41:44,112 --> 01:41:46,059
I did not hear back from Marshall Cogburn.

1462
01:41:46,373 --> 01:41:47,766
And he did not appear.

1463
01:41:50,095 --> 01:41:54,167
Then one day I received a note from
the Marshall, with a flyer enclosed.

1464
01:41:56,255 --> 01:41:58,712
He said he was traveling with the Wild West show.

1465
01:41:58,907 --> 01:42:00,349
Getting older and fatter.

1466
01:42:01,323 --> 01:42:06,242
But I like to come visit him when the show
came to Memphis, and swap stories
with an old trail mate.

1467
01:42:07,739 --> 01:42:10,148
He would understand if the journey was to long.

1468
01:42:14,225 --> 01:42:16,034
Brief tho his note was.

1469
01:42:16,792 --> 01:42:18,595
It was rife with misspellings.

1470
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:21,060
Yesum?

1471
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:22,947
I am, Cole Younger.

1472
01:42:23,538 --> 01:42:25,221
This is Mr. James.

1473
01:42:26,753 --> 01:42:30,064
It grieves me to tell you that you have missed, Rooster.

1474
01:42:30,643 --> 01:42:33,042
He passed away three days ago.

1475
01:42:33,043 --> 01:42:35,510
When the show was at Jonesboro Arkansas.

1476
01:42:35,932 --> 01:42:38,490
Buried him there at a Confederate cemetery.

1477
01:42:40,228 --> 01:42:44,114
Ruben had a complaint what he referred to as,
Night hawks.

1478
01:42:44,286 --> 01:42:47,539
And I believe the warm weather was to much for him.

1479
01:42:49,007 --> 01:42:51,697
We had some lively times.

1480
01:42:52,923 --> 01:42:55,542
What was the nature of your acquaintance?

1481
01:42:56,698 --> 01:42:58,703
I knew the Marshall long ago.

1482
01:42:59,521 --> 01:43:02,697
We too had, lively times.

1483
01:43:04,769 --> 01:43:06,092
Thank you, Mr. Younger.

1484
01:43:08,748 --> 01:43:10,448
Keep your seat, trash.

1485
01:43:12,738 --> 01:43:16,639
I had the body removed to our plot and
I had visited it over the years.

1486
01:43:21,555 --> 01:43:23,395
No doubt people talked about that.

1487
01:43:24,069 --> 01:43:27,140
They say, "Well, she hardly knew the man".

1488
01:43:27,269 --> 01:43:29,466
"Isn't she a cranky old maid".

1489
01:43:30,461 --> 01:43:32,827
It is true, I have not married.

1490
01:43:32,828 --> 01:43:34,752
I never had time to fool with it.

1491
01:43:38,118 --> 01:43:41,122
I heard nothing more of the Texas
officer, La Boeuf.

1492
01:43:41,541 --> 01:43:44,579
If he is yet alive. I would be pleased
to hear from him.

1493
01:43:45,288 --> 01:43:47,497
I judge he would be in his seventies now.

1494
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,359
And near eighty in seventy.

1495
01:43:50,310 --> 01:43:53,539
I expect some of the starch has gone
out of that cowlick.

1496
01:43:55,515 --> 01:43:57,350
Time just gets away from us.

1497
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:11,828
<i>*What a fellowship, what a joy divine,*</i>

1498
01:44:11,828 --> 01:44:17,726
<i>*Leaning on the everlasting arms.*</i>

1499
01:44:17,728 --> 01:44:23,949
<i>*What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,*</i>

1500
01:44:23,951 --> 01:44:30,518
<i>*Leaning on the everlasting arms.*</i>

1501
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:37,527
<i>*Leaning, leaning,*</i>

1502
01:44:37,528 --> 01:44:43,822
<i>*safe and secure from all alarms.*</i>

1503
01:44:43,823 --> 01:44:49,596
<i>*Leaning, leaning,*</i>

1504
01:44:49,597 --> 01:44:56,399
<i>*leaning on the everlasting arms.*</i>

1505
01:44:58,007 --> 01:45:03,726
<i>*Oh, how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,*</i>

1506
01:45:03,728 --> 01:45:09,978
<i>*Leaning on the everlasting arms*</i>

1507
01:45:10,179 --> 01:45:16,404
<i>*Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day,*</i>

1508
01:45:16,404 --> 01:45:22,670
<i>*Leaning on the everlasting arms.*</i>

1509
01:45:24,177 --> 01:45:30,524
<i>*Leaning, leaning,*</i>

1510
01:45:30,524 --> 01:45:37,073
<i>*safe and secure from all alarms.*</i>

1511
01:45:37,074 --> 01:45:43,139
<i>*Leaning, leaning,*</i>

1512
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:48,140
<i>*I'm leaning on the everlasting arms.*</i>
