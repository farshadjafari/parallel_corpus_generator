1
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:14,081
It's the Boxer.

2
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:26,081
He's dead alright.

3
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,706
Pull over!

4
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:21,249
- Can I get in?
- No.

5
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,415
- No room?
- All full.

6
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,665
Climb up here.

7
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,415
I'll stay here, thanks.

8
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,624
Driver.

9
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,790
Papers.

10
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:50,040
- Where are you going?
- Home.

11
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:52,374
Where is your home?

12
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,665
The coffee plantation further down,
that way.

13
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,790
There used to be a roadblock here.
Did you ever pay them?

14
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:01,874
Yes, I think I did once.

15
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,999
- How much?
- I can't remember... 1 00 dollars.

16
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,665
To those thugs?

17
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,956
No wonder they act above the law!

18
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,249
I had to get through. Everyone pays.

19
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,456
That's what breeds corruption.

20
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:21,290
Because of people like you,
this country is filthy.

21
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,081
Can I sit down, sir?

22
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,706
To those ensconced
deep in the forest:

23
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,249
Wake up.
Leave your hideouts.

24
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,831
Herbs that tone your muscles...

25
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,956
and render you

26
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,999
invisible

27
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,456
and invulnerable.

28
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,249
Madame Vial!

29
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:37,664
This is your last warning!

30
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,624
You have to leave immediately!

31
00:09:53,332 --> 00:09:54,874
Madame Vial!

32
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:58,706
The French army is pulling out!
We're leaving!

33
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,914
You'll be totally cut off!

34
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:04,539
Think it over, Madame Vial!

35
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,206
Think of your family!

36
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:13,249
We're pulling out!

37
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,081
You must leave immediately!

38
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,831
SURVIVAL KIT

39
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,664
These whites, these dirty whites.

40
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,249
They scorn us.

41
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,164
We risk our lives for them!

42
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,206
They're a bunch of upstarts!

43
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:30,164
Pretentious, arrogant, ignorant.

44
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,664
They don't deserve
this beautiful land.

45
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,249
They can't even appreciate it!

46
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,249
GOD DOESN'T GIVE UP

47
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,124
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

48
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:51,124
- Where are you going?
- No way to stay.

49
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,914
You can't leave. We just started!

50
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,206
Let's go back.

51
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:59,331
You know it too! You can't stay.
You heard it from above.

52
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,206
Just listen!

53
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:05,082
I just need one week.
Five days or the crop will be ruined.

54
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,957
Five days is nothing.
Things have been bad for months!

55
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,457
Your foremen...
They're also leaving.

56
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,207
Ange and Maurice? I doubt it.

57
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,999
They are! And so are we!

58
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,707
This is getting bad.

59
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,539
Let's go!
Before trouble catches up with us!

60
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,707
Hold on!

61
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,999
Stay here. Why are you leaving?

62
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:33,374
Suffering and war everywhere!

63
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,207
- One week! Just one week!
- No.

64
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,957
Ange!

65
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,332
You can't go, Maurice.
What will we do?

66
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,164
We need a week. You saw the crops.

67
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,124
One week at the most!

68
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,207
One short week.

69
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:20,332
All of a sudden you can't stay?
It's too dangerous?

70
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,582
It may be less dangerous...
In fact.

71
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,499
We don't have to be terrorized.
We can fight back.

72
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,707
That copter didn't come for fun.

73
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,707
It came for you and your family.
Not for us!

74
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,789
André is right.

75
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:45,582
Coffee's coffee.
Not worth dying for.

76
00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:50,207
Where are your kids?

77
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,499
Out of harm's way.

78
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,832
Out of harm's way! Open your eyes!

79
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,414
You have a son.

80
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,124
Get him out of bed!

81
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,789
Let him go pick!

82
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:03,664
You have no right to criticize Manuel!

83
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,082
Get lost! Never come back again!

84
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:09,207
Never! You hear me, Maurice?
Understood?

85
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,124
André?

86
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,664
André isn't here.

87
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,624
André, André...

88
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:37,914
I knew it.
They can't take you down.

89
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,039
Not you, not the Boxer!

90
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,957
I used to say...

91
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,249
if ever I could meet the Boxer

92
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,164
and fight for him...

93
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,832
I'd ask God for nothing else.

94
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,582
Where is it from?

95
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,499
- Where?
- The plantation down there.

96
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,957
It's just white material.

97
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,789
Get up, Manuel, please. I need you.

98
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:06,332
Who's there?

99
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,414
What are you doing here?

100
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,164
Waiting for my uncle.

101
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,914
- Are you Jean-Marie's nephew?
- Yes.

102
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,664
Does he know you're here?

103
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,332
He'll be glad to see me.

104
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,999
Are you thirsty?

105
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,249
You want something to eat?

106
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,332
Lucie!

107
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,374
- Where are you going?
- To pick up José.

108
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,874
I'll go. I need to hire workers.

109
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,457
I'll get José after.

110
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:42,957
- You don't get it!
- You let them scare you!

111
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,414
- You take it.
- This is ridiculous.

112
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,832
Who opened the safe?

113
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,457
Why do you ask?

114
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:57,414
Look, it's a mess inside.

115
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,914
Ask André instead.

116
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,707
I don't have the keys.

117
00:29:41,165 --> 00:29:42,207
Okay, man!

118
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,999
Leaving?

119
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,289
Just for the village.

120
00:29:49,415 --> 00:29:51,207
It'll be 1 00 dollars.

121
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,624
You're my son's gym teacher.

122
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,249
I'm Maria Vial.

123
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,999
Never saw you. It's 1 00.
Whether you go or not.

124
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:02,539
Cut it out. It's 1 0 if I go,
zero if I don't.

125
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:04,749
You know who I am.

126
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,499
I know all of you.

127
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,914
Peter Nembo, François-Joseph.

128
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,332
Your father sells seeds.

129
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,124
Why mention his father?

130
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,957
You pay and you go.
Or else you die.

131
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:22,582
If she doesn't pay,

132
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,249
I'll waste her!

133
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:53,874
Hello, Bernard.

134
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,624
Hello, Christine.

135
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,082
That's serious protection!

136
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:02,707
I'm not so sure...
It's really not much.

137
00:31:07,915 --> 00:31:11,082
Mr. Vial's medicine.
I checked. It's all there.

138
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:13,124
Except for the oxygen.

139
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,082
André will pick it up later.

140
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,164
Got a pen?

141
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,164
We prefer cash now. Dollars.

142
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,957
I see...

143
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,082
Take this.

144
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,124
Can you break these bills for me?

145
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:43,457
Many things are to be found
in Mama's and Papa's homes.

146
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,957
But go about it gently.

147
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,414
Everyone is entitled his share.

148
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,707
And don't ever forget...

149
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,874
what fate has in store for us,

150
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,457
no one can take away.

151
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,249
You should leave.

152
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:03,914
Beware of imposters,
smooth talkers and thieves.

153
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:07,914
As for the white material,
the party's over.

154
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:11,664
No more cocktails on shaded verandas

155
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,414
while we sweat water and blood.

156
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,914
They're deserting.

157
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:20,539
They're right to run scared.

158
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:24,039
Our rulers are already trembling,

159
00:32:24,165 --> 00:32:27,874
their valises filled
with booty they amassed

160
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,539
while you were starving.

161
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,164
Hello. Is your Daddy here?

162
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,914
Daddy's not home.

163
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,624
Goodbye.

164
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,707
THE MAYOR KEEPS HIS WORD

165
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,457
She'll be stunned
that you tried selling the plantation.

166
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,249
You're betraying her.

167
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,539
I'm protecting her from herself.

168
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:55,164
We no longer turn a profit.

169
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,707
No use getting massacred
over some coffee.

170
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:02,582
The plantation isn't worth a thing.

171
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,248
I'm glad to hear
the plantation is worthless.

172
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,998
I keep you alive.

173
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:13,789
Without me,
you'd be rotting on the Garonne.

174
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:17,373
Come on, don't overdo it!

175
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,914
André...

176
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,498
It's falling apart. Beyond hope.

177
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:36,373
In six months it'll be raining inside.

178
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,331
It was already too late
when you built it.

179
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:42,914
That's when you should have left.

180
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,248
At least with your wife and José.

181
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:49,498
It's a nice piece of land.

182
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,414
But still...

183
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:53,956
If I add up everything you owe me,

184
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:57,956
I should, first of all,
seize the plantation.

185
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,706
And second,

186
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:02,331
kick you out.

187
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:07,206
And you'd still owe me
and the government.

188
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:15,831
Enough...

189
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:19,331
Get your father's signature.

190
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,998
Have your Fanta.

191
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,956
This is my Fanta.

192
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,414
Is this what you want?

193
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,081
These are my men.

194
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,956
They can take you to the frontier.

195
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:49,289
Pay them cash. Keep it between us.

196
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:53,914
Got any gas left?

197
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:55,706
Yeah, a little.

198
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,831
Where do they come from?

199
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,914
My personal militia.

200
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:16,289
Your personal militia...
Come on, spare me.

201
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,706
Is that how you intend
to stop the rebels?

202
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,581
- Everyone here?
- Yes!

203
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,373
- Anything to say?
- Yes!

204
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,123
- What is it?
- Knock down the rebels!

205
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:40,956
I have work to be done,
a harvest to finish.

206
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,456
Do you have any men?

207
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:45,581
To come and work at my place.

208
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,748
Wait here.

209
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,039
Wait.

210
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:42,873
So it's half up front,

211
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,373
the other half after.

212
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,206
Three meals a day... and cola nuts.

213
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:33,456
It's quiet. We've never had trouble.
It's for a few days.

214
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:36,123
Shall we go?

215
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:42,164
TAKE DOWN THE BOXER!

216
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,581
Why "take down"?

217
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:50,164
They say they killed him.
It's bad for us.

218
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,289
Now it will get even worse.

219
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:40,956
STAND FIRM

220
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,498
Start running, now.

221
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,664
Things are getting dangerous.

222
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,998
Get going now. It's bad.

223
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:25,914
We can't get caught between
the army and the rebels.

224
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,998
How can he judge the danger?

225
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,331
If we start believing the radio...

226
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:38,581
After this job,
I'm buying a motorbike and I'm off.

227
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,164
My daughter is sick.

228
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,414
She's too young.

229
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,456
No choice but to stay.

230
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:52,373
What's wrong with her?

231
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:57,831
I don't know. She's in bed.
She doesn't move.

232
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:01,206
Did you try the clinic?

233
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,206
It's too late now.

234
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:19,206
I need to pick someone up.

235
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,081
Are you his mother?

236
00:42:43,416 --> 00:42:45,414
- His stepmother?
- Not exactly.

237
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:49,331
You have to tell me who you are.

238
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:54,039
I'm his father's ex-wife.
José is my son's half-brother.

239
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:57,373
Listen, I'm in a rush.
Can you go get him?

240
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:00,664
Go yourself.

241
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:02,498
I should go?

242
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,456
Thank you!

243
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,331
José, I'm taking you home.

244
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,831
José, gather your belongings.

245
00:43:17,916 --> 00:43:19,748
José, hurry up!

246
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,831
Soon it will be empty here.

247
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:34,623
- Have many kids left already?
- Yes.

248
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:40,831
Your mother wants you at home.

249
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:44,164
School's of no interest.
Why would they come?

250
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,498
I don't know, José. I really don't.

251
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,789
I just hired some workers.

252
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:51,331
They're in the truck.

253
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:54,831
Will you help out too?

254
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:56,414
No problem.

255
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:59,789
No problem...

256
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:03,456
With you there's never any problem.

257
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,373
You make it all seem easy.

258
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:12,789
Why are you here?

259
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,581
I came to pick up José.

260
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,331
I didn't know you'd be here.

261
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,289
You had to hire workers...

262
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:22,748
Everyone left, even Ange and Maurice.
There's no one.

263
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:24,456
I found the gate open.

264
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,998
Ange and Maurice are gone? Damn...

265
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:31,706
You don't seem upset.
I wonder if you already knew...

266
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:48,956
Lucie said you could get gas.

267
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,623
That's right.
I'll have some tomorrow.

268
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:58,081
Your son?

269
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:00,623
Not him, but I have a son too.

270
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,789
Are you the boss?

271
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:38,581
Yes, I mean...

272
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:41,081
In a way.

273
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:43,081
Nothing's mine but I'm in charge.

274
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:46,914
When it's not yours...
it's just hot air.

275
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,998
You scared me.

276
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,831
I thought I'd die last night.

277
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:41,289
Don't say that.

278
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,206
Tomorrow we'll put you in
André's room.

279
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:47,789
It's air-conditioned.

280
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,956
Maria...

281
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,123
I was born here.

282
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:56,248
That old place of yours
is my home.

283
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,498
It's where I feel best.

284
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,164
The plantation is yours.

285
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:05,748
It's all yours.

286
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,748
See, I didn't need it.

287
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,248
Did Manuel come and help?

288
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,539
Your Manuel? He's a good kid.

289
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:01,248
A little sluggish.

290
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:02,831
A lousy picker.

291
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:04,789
Ripe or unripe, he doesn't care.

292
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,581
Don't badmouth my son,
Lucie, please.

293
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:14,164
I don't mention yours.
You do the same, okay?

294
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,331
Mine is a different story.

295
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:05,914
Manuel, get up.
How can you spend all day in bed?

296
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:07,956
- Get up!
- Lay off!

297
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,498
Watch your mouth!

298
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,164
I don't know what to do.
You disappoint me.

299
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,373
School's closed anyway.

300
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,664
Nothing interests you.
You hang around all day.

301
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,206
We can't even talk.

302
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:25,039
It's like we don't exist.

303
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:28,373
No need to talk.
I'm sick of this blah-blah.

304
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,498
I'll send you to France.
You'll see the difference.

305
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,498
Move it, Manuel! Get up!

306
00:49:38,416 --> 00:49:40,248
I don't know what happened.

307
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:43,706
I can't believe you're my son!

308
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:45,623
I feel like a total failure.

309
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:50,289
If I met a woman with a son like you,
I'd think...

310
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:52,498
"Lousy upbringing. Such a waste."

311
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:56,706
Okay, I'm coming.

312
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,456
I'll get dressed. Where's the fire?

313
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:04,956
Losing a crop is worse than a fire.
In the end.

314
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:07,248
Letting yourself go, Manuel,

315
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:10,748
is the vilest thing a boy can do.
It's loathsome.

316
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,789
Come on, get up!

317
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:15,623
Okay, I'm coming.

318
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,206
I'm coming!

319
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:09,998
Why did you scream?

320
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:11,623
I thought I saw something.

321
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,539
It'll be fine, my son.
You'll see.

322
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:31,081
It'll be fine.

323
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:41,248
Listen up, rascals,
wherever you are.

324
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,498
Listen to my words.

325
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:47,581
Fearless young rascals...

326
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:51,414
The Boxer is back.
He's in hiding.

327
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,206
Go find him.

328
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:59,039
Get out there and find him.

329
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,498
Go on, Manuel. Get dressed.

330
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:55,289
We need to crack down. He's inert.

331
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,289
School's out of the question now.

332
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:00,873
They're all closed, and for good.

333
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,706
- You know what I just saw?
- No.

334
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:05,789
Two kids with a machete
and a spear.

335
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:09,873
I'll tell Jean-Marie tonight.

336
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,789
Where is Jean-Marie?

337
00:53:11,916 --> 00:53:13,748
Anyway, I'm sure he hasn't left.

338
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,331
Help me down.

339
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:24,331
Those two kids...
They were strange, threatening.

340
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:26,873
- I thought they'd...
- What?

341
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:29,914
I don't know. Attack Manuel.

342
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,039
I'm going.

343
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:41,456
We won't even be able
to sell the coffee now.

344
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:43,498
You're becoming defeatist.

345
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:46,623
If we harvest it,
its value will increase.

346
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,164
What if we all went back to France?

347
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:52,248
Why did you see the mayor?
I saw your motorbike.

348
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:54,039
He formed a militia!

349
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:55,914
I asked him for protection!

350
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:57,164
Why not tell me?

351
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:59,373
Tell me these things first!

352
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,831
And you can't take money
without telling me!

353
00:54:58,041 --> 00:57:39,081
Yellow dog.

354
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,706
Manuel? Manuel!

355
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:58,289
It came from here. Follow me!

356
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,623
Look.

357
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,789
We never check here.
It's been broken for months.

358
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:32,831
There are footprints, right there.

359
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:36,039
Left by kids...

360
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:39,664
It must be young shepherds...

361
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:42,039
who wanted to...

362
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:45,206
run off with a sheep.

363
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:54,373
Armed young shepherds.

364
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,248
It's nothing. I hurt my foot.

365
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:05,789
Show me.

366
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:08,831
Ride on the tractor with me.

367
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:11,373
We'll get the trailer.

368
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,414
We'll manage. It's nothing.

369
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,581
Climb up.

370
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:27,414
Don't stand there, José.

371
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,914
What did you do to your hair?

372
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:17,664
He says happiness
isn't enough for me.

373
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,373
I have nowhere to go.
I won't give this up.

374
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:29,498
You're my son.
I can't let you drift away.

375
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:33,289
You know I won't let you go.

376
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,498
Manuel?

377
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:40,789
From Sylvie S., for her parents
and her sister-in-law:

378
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:46,414
"Leaving devil's lair.
Will give you my new address. "

379
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:24,456
From François and Vincent M.
for their sister, Elisabeth:

380
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,164
"We'll pry you from their dirty grip.

381
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:32,998
"Get ready. We're on our way. "

382
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:33,081
Drop the rifle.
What are you doing?

383
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,456
Drop it!

384
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:37,914
You're crazy!

385
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:40,456
Go away! Beat it, filthy dog!

386
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:43,414
This isn't your home.
Your father sold it!

387
01:05:46,458 --> 01:05:48,456
Get lost, little shit!

388
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:51,831
Get lost.

389
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:58,831
You're sick!

390
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:06,914
The patriots will kill you all!

391
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:08,498
All of you!

392
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:31,164
Shut it off when it's full.

393
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:00,373
Is Manuel back?

394
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,706
Yes.

395
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,373
What are you hiding?

396
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,164
Let go!

397
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,373
You're insane!

398
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,164
Totally insane!

399
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:24,373
Know what this means?

400
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,332
Do you have any idea?

401
01:08:29,625 --> 01:08:30,873
We'll all die.

402
01:08:52,207 --> 01:08:55,039
Push it all to the centre.

403
01:08:55,166 --> 01:08:57,414
Keep them out from the corners.

404
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:34,498
Not a good sign.

405
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:39,248
We often have power-outs.
It's why we have a generator.

406
01:11:41,832 --> 01:11:43,664
This always gets stuck.

407
01:11:51,166 --> 01:11:52,582
You crank this...

408
01:11:52,707 --> 01:11:55,582
Don't worry, I'll manage.

409
01:12:01,957 --> 01:12:04,332
There's not much gas left.

410
01:12:04,457 --> 01:12:08,082
We know everyone here.
Getting gasoline won't be hard.

411
01:12:09,457 --> 01:12:11,289
We've been rooted here for years.

412
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:13,373
Here we go...

413
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:50,457
They're dangerous, very dangerous,
because they're hungry.

414
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:55,207
I saw the army of child soldiers.

415
01:13:55,332 --> 01:13:57,748
Notjust boys, girls as well.

416
01:13:58,332 --> 01:14:01,832
They're orphans.
They saw their parents killed.

417
01:14:01,957 --> 01:14:04,623
Some have walked 150 kilometres

418
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,289
in search of the Boxer.

419
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:09,664
Why did you lie to me? Why?

420
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:13,164
Manuel never came home.

421
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:16,373
He did something awful.

422
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,957
He hurt Elisabeth.

423
01:14:18,082 --> 01:14:19,957
Did she say that?

424
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:21,414
What a liar!

425
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:23,748
She ran off.

426
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:25,457
She's not a liar.

427
01:14:25,582 --> 01:14:27,664
He took my rifle. He's gone mad.

428
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:31,164
Shut up! I won't discuss my son
with you either!

429
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:33,082
The wires were cut!

430
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:38,457
So I'm keeping the gas
for the truck.

431
01:14:38,582 --> 01:14:39,914
To leave.

432
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:41,664
Cherif will help us.

433
01:14:42,832 --> 01:14:44,248
In exchange for what?

434
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:48,373
He's our friend.

435
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:08,914
Manuel?

436
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:26,748
There's everything you need.
You can...

437
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:31,498
You can cook. There are beds...

438
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:33,873
You'll be safe here.

439
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:36,664
That's for us to decide.

440
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:39,039
Here's the flashlight.

441
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,164
See you tomorrow.

442
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:47,248
There's the water pump.

443
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:50,039
Okay?

444
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:11,164
We have lots of old bones here.

445
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:17,582
- You won't abandon me?
- I've always tended to you.

446
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:22,498
Sign here.

447
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:25,457
And here.

448
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,832
And the money?

449
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:31,707
What money?

450
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:36,832
Who's paying?

451
01:16:42,082 --> 01:16:44,082
Cherif's very smart, you know.

452
01:16:45,832 --> 01:16:47,664
Smarter than you.

453
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:15,373
You okay, Jean-Marie? All well?

454
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,998
Fine.

455
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,957
Good to hear it.

456
01:17:28,582 --> 01:17:30,039
You won't leave?

457
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:36,082
I'm too old to start all over.

458
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,707
I couldn't get used
to anywhere else either.

459
01:17:44,207 --> 01:17:46,623
For you, it's not the same thing.

460
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:49,248
Not at all.

461
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:52,707
You don't want anyone
taking what you have.

462
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,832
Maybe you're right.

463
01:17:59,832 --> 01:18:02,664
- I cooked some rice.
- Thank you.

464
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:08,914
Shall I turn on the generator?

465
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:10,832
We need gasoline.

466
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:18,457
I saw a relative of yours today.
Your nephew.

467
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:26,498
He needs some time.

468
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,623
Have you seen Manuel around?

469
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,748
Okay, I'm going.

470
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:09,873
Your son...

471
01:20:10,957 --> 01:20:12,664
I can see he's changed.

472
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:17,748
It's hard to get through to him.

473
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:21,457
He's grown up.

474
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,957
It's not just that.

475
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:29,664
His mind runs all over the place.

476
01:20:33,707 --> 01:20:35,123
He's become a dog.

477
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,289
Insane?

478
01:20:50,582 --> 01:20:51,998
He's half-baked.

479
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:56,207
He's unfinished.

480
01:21:07,791 --> 01:21:09,582
Half-baked...

481
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:18,039
Manuel?

482
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,998
You're here?

483
01:21:21,666 --> 01:21:23,123
You're wounded.

484
01:21:26,916 --> 01:21:28,498
What can we do?

485
01:21:29,207 --> 01:21:31,082
Give me that bottle of water.

486
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:47,164
It's no longer safe here
for someone like you.

487
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,873
For someone like you either.

488
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:57,082
This is my son's room.

489
01:22:09,957 --> 01:22:11,998
Why didn't you leave with your son?

490
01:22:12,125 --> 01:22:14,164
I'm a good fighter too.

491
01:22:14,291 --> 01:22:16,789
How could I show courage in France?

492
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:18,998
It would be absurd,
no rhyme or reason.

493
01:22:20,457 --> 01:22:22,873
I'd slack off, get too comfortable.

494
01:22:27,875 --> 01:22:28,957
You're hot.

495
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:33,498
I'll get medicine tomorrow.

496
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:22,164
We now have the situation
under control.

497
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:26,789
The rebels no longer control the area.

498
01:24:27,832 --> 01:24:30,332
The Northern sector has been purged

499
01:24:30,457 --> 01:24:33,248
and we'll continue to clean house.

500
01:24:34,082 --> 01:24:36,582
A reliable source has informed us

501
01:24:36,707 --> 01:24:39,123
that the rebel soldier,

502
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:40,539
the Boxer,

503
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:44,039
is hiding out amidst foreigners

504
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:47,457
who rip us off and use our land

505
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:52,039
to grow mediocre coffee
that we'd never drink.

506
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:55,123
Their accomplices will be eliminated.

507
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:57,207
What good is money if you're dead?

508
01:24:57,332 --> 01:24:58,707
I paid in advance!

509
01:24:58,832 --> 01:25:01,789
Yes but...
you bewitched us with your words!

510
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:03,539
I hear you hide rebels!

511
01:25:03,666 --> 01:25:05,957
It's not safe. We want our money!

512
01:25:06,082 --> 01:25:09,248
- Plus a bonus!
- I didn't make you come!

513
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:11,832
- We must finish!
- Give us our money!

514
01:25:11,957 --> 01:25:14,373
We want our money!

515
01:25:15,957 --> 01:25:18,039
Hand it over!

516
01:25:21,707 --> 01:25:23,623
- The money's gone.
- No way!

517
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,998
Look, the safe is empty.

518
01:25:26,957 --> 01:25:28,748
Someone stole all our money!

519
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:30,707
Rotten luck!

520
01:25:30,832 --> 01:25:32,457
Can't you see?

521
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:36,664
I'll get more. Here's 200.

522
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:37,957
Is that all?

523
01:25:38,082 --> 01:25:39,332
Give it to us!

524
01:25:39,457 --> 01:25:41,998
I'll pay you tomorrow.

525
01:25:42,707 --> 01:25:44,789
Take us home. We won't wait.

526
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:13,582
Everyone, get out! Out!

527
01:26:27,041 --> 01:26:28,123
Get out!

528
01:26:30,207 --> 01:26:31,707
No money. We're poor.

529
01:26:31,832 --> 01:26:33,332
Empty your pockets.

530
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:35,957
Everything!

531
01:26:38,582 --> 01:26:40,582
You can't! We're poor!

532
01:26:41,832 --> 01:26:44,664
You're crazy! You're crazy!

533
01:27:09,166 --> 01:27:10,789
Christine, Bernard!

534
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:13,082
Go away! He's dead now!

535
01:29:31,916 --> 01:29:33,582
I know where the Boxer is!

536
01:29:33,707 --> 01:29:35,498
He's at my place!

537
01:29:37,207 --> 01:29:38,664
Wait for me!

538
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:46,789
I know where the Boxer is!

539
01:31:54,666 --> 01:31:58,248
Please, sir! Can you pull over?

540
01:31:59,416 --> 01:32:01,623
This is where I get off!

541
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:04,207
Driver,
white lady wants to get off.

542
01:32:05,207 --> 01:32:06,914
I'm not stopping here.

543
01:32:07,457 --> 01:32:10,373
That's where I'm going.
Please pull over!

544
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,998
I won't stop here.

545
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:14,332
It's dangerous here now.

546
01:36:43,332 --> 01:36:44,998
Are you going that way?

547
01:36:45,791 --> 01:36:47,414
Are you heading back?

548
01:36:48,666 --> 01:36:50,373
How long till you leave?

549
01:36:57,666 --> 01:37:00,832
I have to go home.
Tell me how to get home!

550
01:37:01,875 --> 01:37:04,914
- Where do you live?
- The Vial coffee plantation.

551
01:37:05,041 --> 01:37:06,289
I know it.

552
01:37:06,416 --> 01:37:07,957
Marida!

553
01:37:08,082 --> 01:37:11,248
- My son is there!
- This way.

554
01:37:20,457 --> 01:37:22,373
Take her to the Vial plantation.

555
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,539
- The old white guy's place?
- Yes.

556
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:27,373
Can't you take me?

557
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:37,082
I'm tired.

558
01:38:03,041 --> 01:38:06,707
Manuel took my bike
and disappeared.

559
01:38:06,832 --> 01:38:09,082
Help me find him. He can't cope.

560
01:38:10,541 --> 01:38:12,623
He's defenceless without me.

561
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,248
Extreme blondness brings bad luck.

562
01:38:20,666 --> 01:38:22,914
It cries out to be pillaged.

563
01:38:26,875 --> 01:38:28,498
Blue eyes are troublesome.

564
01:38:32,666 --> 01:38:35,332
This is his country.
He was born here.

565
01:38:35,457 --> 01:38:37,539
But it doesn't like him.

566
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:45,498
The Boxer is hiding at my place.

567
01:38:46,207 --> 01:38:47,707
I know.

568
01:38:56,582 --> 01:38:59,207
Stop the car.
I want to go home alone.
