For you, picking Sarah Palin
was about winning an election,

not necessarily about who's gonna
be best as vice president.

It's the single
best weapon we've got.

I want to run a fucking campaign

that John is not
a true conservative.

Now, I don't think picking
a pro-choice Jewish democrat

150

who just happened to be
Al Gore's running mate

151

that concern.

Maybe we have McCain
make a one-term pledge.

He announces in some huge

155

greatest problems.

Thank you.

174
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:02,560
So what the fuck
happened?

175
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:05,597
Lindsey Graham was trying to
build support for the idea

176
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,766
- and it leaked.
- God damn it, Lindsey.

177
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,369
Well, if it's
any consolation,

178
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:12,537
my numbers show that
if you pick lieberman

179
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:14,940
or any pro-choice
candidate,

180
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:17,075
40% of your
core supporters

181
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,943
will be less likely
to support you.

182
00:08:18,977 --> 00:08:20,378
40%.

183
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:22,679
And you gain
very few independents.

184
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:24,515
<i>Overall,</i>
<i>it's a wide-net negative.</i>

185
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,817
We've made a lot of calls.
Some people don't even think

186
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:28,953
lieberman can make it
through the convention.

187
00:08:28,987 --> 00:08:30,454
Others say,
yeah, he can,

188
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:32,856
but he's gonna rip
the party in half.

189
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:34,724
But Joe is perfect.
We're both mavericks

190
00:08:34,758 --> 00:08:37,360
that are hated by the
assholes in our own parties.

191
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:40,130
It could have a tremendous
healing effect on the country.

192
00:08:40,164 --> 00:08:42,498
We can't win
without our base.

193
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,367
Lieberman is
the right thing to do,

194
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:46,369
but the wrong way to win.

195
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:51,140
- Who all have we vetted?
- Romney, crist, pawlenty.

196
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:54,143
- We're trying to vet bloomberg.
- Who can we win with?

197
00:08:54,177 --> 00:08:55,844
- None of them.
- None of them?

198
00:08:55,878 --> 00:08:59,481
John, Obama just changed
the entire dynamic.

199
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:01,550
Steve:
<i>It is a change year, sir.</i>

200
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:04,586
We desperately need
a game-changing pick,

201
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,457
and none of these middle-aged
white guys are game-changers.

202
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:11,827
So... what?

203
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:13,662
I just fuck off and die?

204
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:17,332
Well, the data shows we have
four things we have to do.

205
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:19,767
We have to win back
the independents,

206
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,202
we have to
excite the base,

207
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:24,638
we have to distance ourselves
from the bush administration,

208
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:27,008
and we have to close
the gender gap.

209
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,710
How bad is the gap?

210
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:32,179
It's fatal.

211
00:09:32,213 --> 00:09:36,350
You've got a 20% advantage
with men, which is great,

212
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:38,651
but a 20% deficit
with women.

213
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:41,488
You've got to pick up
15% with females.

214
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:45,192
Because if you're trailing
by more than five with them,

215
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:46,693
you lose.

216
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:51,263
So find me a woman.

217
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:56,902
All right, ladies.
Who's it gonna be?

218
00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:08,179
Meg Whitman supports
abortion rights.

219
00:10:10,182 --> 00:10:13,184
Pro-choice, pro-choice.

220
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:19,290
- Who are you?
- These solar arrays combined

221
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:23,260
will allow us to produce
34 megawatts of power...

222
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:24,629
<i>( Keyboard clicking )</i>

223
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:28,633
To make sure
that risk management

224
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:31,536
is the best that
we can do to secure...

225
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,037
<i>( Keyboard clicking )</i>

226
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:36,806
But as you know, the turnpike
ends here in Augusta.

227
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,675
At that point...

228
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:46,215
What was her name?

229
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:50,787
Woman:
<i>Once Alaska is allowed</i>

230
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:53,956
to very responsibly and
safely develop our resources,

231
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,025
we'll lower costs of energy
across the United States,

232
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:58,293
<i>and then we'd be able</i>
<i>to secure the nation</i>

233
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:01,296
with a clean, domestic
supply of energy.

234
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,967
And I say that, Charlie,
even personally.

235
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:07,369
My one and only son,
my 18-year-old,

236
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:09,203
he just signed up
for the United States army.

237
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:10,672
He's at boot camp
right now.

238
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:12,139
And I'm thinkin',
you know,

239
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:15,977
this kid is doing all
that he can within his power

240
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:19,614
to help secure and defend
the United States.

241
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:22,349
Every elected official had
better be asking themselves,

242
00:11:22,384 --> 00:11:24,785
are you doing as much also?

243
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,020
Are you doing
all that you can?

244
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,024
She's a star.

245
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,527
She's so passionately
pro-life that at age 44,

246
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:36,063
she decided
to keep a child

247
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:39,299
that she knew mid-term
had down's syndrome.

248
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,767
And there's a lot more
that the base will love.

249
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,837
She has an 80% approval
rating in Alaska.

250
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,907
- The highest of any governor in the country--
- 80%?

251
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,476
And she got it
by taking on the oil lobby

252
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,377
and the republican
establishment.

253
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,080
She's the one who killed
the bridge to nowhere.

254
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,781
( Laughs ) I fought Ted
Stevens for months

255
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,382
on that stupid
fucking bridge.

256
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,184
Rick: <i>Plus, she is</i>
<i>a devout Christian.</i>

257
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,553
She's got a son about
to deploy to Iraq,

258
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,322
<i>attractive mother of five.</i>

259
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,025
- <i>She likes to moose hunt.</i>
- Moose hunt?

260
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,559
This is a woman
with a gun, John.

261
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,929
I mean, come on, the base is
gonna be doing back flips.

262
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,463
What does salter think?

263
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,399
Uh, he's worried that
she's a creationist.

264
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,269
Yeah, and that's exactly
why the base will love her.

265
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,770
Women will love her.

266
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:22,273
Plus, she gives you
distance from bush.

267
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:24,375
Furthermore,
she's so outside the box

268
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:27,945
that she helps you
recapture the Maverick label,

269
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:29,879
which will win back
independents.

270
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:31,981
She's everything we need.

271
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:37,053
You don't think she might be
too outside the box?

272
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:42,125
Huh. Well, that's what makes
her such a Maverick choice.

273
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,226
So is picking lieberman.

274
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:46,328
That'd be pretty
goddamn mavericky.

275
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,897
Sir, we live in
the age of YouTube

276
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:51,233
and the 24-hour
news cycle.

277
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:52,968
How else
do you think a man

278
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:56,238
who has absolutely no
major life accomplishments

279
00:12:56,273 --> 00:13:00,108
is beating an American
hero by double digits?

280
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:03,645
He's simply sailing on his
charisma and star power.

281
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,948
We need to create a dynamic
moment in this campaign

282
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:09,484
or we're dead.

283
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:11,386
You think she's that good?

284
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,620
She could be.

285
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:14,689
And we can vet her
in five days?

286
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:16,023
We can.

287
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:17,957
The vet has to be
as thorough for her

288
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:20,327
as it was for all
the other candidates.

289
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:22,696
Culvahouse says
he can do it, so...

290
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,665
The clock
is ticking, sir.

291
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:28,602
If you are going to seriously
consider the governor of Alaska,

292
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:30,904
you have to call her now.

293
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,807
<i>( Crowd noise )</i>

294
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:36,642
Woman: <i>You know, Governor,</i>
<i>these gas prices</i>

295
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:39,945
- <i>are killing us.</i>
- Oh, my goodness, don't I know it.

296
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:41,681
They're killing
me and Todd, too.

297
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:43,115
Hey, how are ya?

298
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:45,618
But once Alaska
is allowed to very safely

299
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,486
and responsibly
develop our resources,

300
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:50,655
we'll lower cost of energy
across the entire nation.

301
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,090
You keep giving
'em hell, Governor.

302
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,025
Aw, thanks.
Nice talking to ya.

303
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:55,993
Mom, can we go on
the roller coaster now?

304
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:57,462
Yeah.
No, of course, honey.

305
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:59,063
- Hey, Bristol?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

306
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:02,500
Can you hold Trig?
I'm gonna take Piper on the roller coaster.

307
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:04,868
- Sure.
- There you go.

308
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:07,738
- There you go, buddy.
- <i>( Cell phone ringing )</i>

309
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:14,945
- Mom.
- Just one second, hon.

310
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,248
This is Sarah.

311
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:40,602
Thank you for coming on
such short notice, Governor.

312
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:42,437
Should this go
according to plan,

313
00:14:42,472 --> 00:14:45,474
we will take you to meet
Senator McCain at his compound

314
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:47,108
first thing in the morning.

315
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:50,345
Now, if he chooses you
to be his running mate,

316
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,080
you will instantly become

317
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:54,214
one of the most famous
people on the planet.

318
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:56,550
Your life will be
investigated,

319
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,085
manipulated, distorted,

320
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:01,455
and you will lose
any semblance of privacy.

321
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,792
Knowing this,
are you 100% committed

322
00:15:04,826 --> 00:15:07,027
to going forward
with this project?

323
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:08,595
Absolutely.

324
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:10,697
I have a servant's heart.

325
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:12,932
And if you really think
I can help this ticket,

326
00:15:12,966 --> 00:15:15,001
if you really think
I can help this country,

327
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:17,236
then absolutely--
I'll do this with ya.

328
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:19,639
Your private life
will be subjected

329
00:15:19,674 --> 00:15:23,142
to harsh,
often unfair attacks.

330
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:25,544
Nothing can
prepare you for...

331
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:27,112
How ugly this can be.
Not--

332
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:30,048
I do understand that.
Here's the deal.

333
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:32,184
I went through
a tough primary in Alaska,

334
00:15:32,218 --> 00:15:35,053
and I know how ugly
it can get.

335
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:38,190
Well, Governor,
things can get

336
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:40,225
quite a bit rougher
on the national stage.

337
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:42,059
I don't know,
Alaska's pretty rough.

338
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:44,995
Steve: <i>Now, you and</i>
<i>Senator McCain</i>

339
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,832
have a difference of opinion
on several issues.

340
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:50,335
He is pro-life, but he's
in favor of exceptions

341
00:15:50,369 --> 00:15:53,571
in the case of rape, incest or
a mother's life being at risk.

342
00:15:53,605 --> 00:15:55,506
- You are not.
- That is correct.

343
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,974
I am unapologetically
pro-life.

344
00:15:59,176 --> 00:16:01,712
Senator McCain supports
stem cell research.

345
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:03,913
- You do not.
- That's true, I do not.

346
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:07,551
John McCain would never ask you
to contradict your beliefs,

347
00:16:07,585 --> 00:16:11,054
but we expect you
to support his positions.

348
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:13,322
And we may ask you
to appear in ads

349
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:16,024
advocating those positions.

350
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,593
Do you have
a problem with that?

351
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:20,796
No, I don't.
Not at all.

352
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:24,132
Senator McCain can count
on my full support.

353
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,069
I would be so proud to be
a member of his team.

354
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:31,806
Do you reject
the theory of evolution?

355
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:36,344
I'm the daughter
of a science teacher.

356
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,514
My dad showed me
fossils growing up.

357
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:42,450
I know about evolution.
I accept evolution.

358
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:46,319
But I will never deny
that I see the hand of God

359
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:51,692
in this beautiful creation
that is earth.

360
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:58,131
I'm really glad
that you're asking me

361
00:16:58,165 --> 00:17:00,833
these types
of questions.

362
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:02,334
Why is that?

363
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:07,206
It's important that you know
exactly what you're getting.

364
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,041
A.B.:
<i>John, let me be very clear.</i>

365
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:12,478
Every other vet we did was over
a four-to-eight-week period.

366
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:15,180
This vet has been compiled
in absolute secrecy

367
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:17,215
<i>in less than five days.</i>

368
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:18,149
<i>I understand.</i>

369
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:19,818
Well, in doing
a vet this fast,

370
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:21,920
there's certainly
the possibility

371
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:23,622
<i>that we may have</i>
<i>missed something.</i>

372
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:26,324
Yeah, I got it.
What do you think, a.B.?

373
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:28,827
I like many of her answers
in the questionnaire.

374
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:32,263
And in the interview, she hit some
of my questions out of the park.

375
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,631
Now...

376
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:36,467
<i>There are more potential</i>
<i>land mines with Palin</i>

377
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,669
<i>than with</i>
<i>the other choices.</i>

378
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:42,005
She told us she has
a teen daughter who's pregnant.

379
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,374
<i>That should not prevent this</i>
<i>from moving forward,</i>

380
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:47,445
but we don't know
what else could pop up.

381
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:50,513
But are you impressed
with her personally?

382
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:56,118
I am.

383
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:58,154
She has a great
life story

384
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:01,691
and she's extremely
poised and confident

385
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:03,593
for someone
in her situation.

386
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:06,462
<i>But you have a candidate</i>

387
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:08,363
<i>who's only been governor</i>
<i>for 18 months.</i>

388
00:18:08,397 --> 00:18:10,599
<i>Before that,</i> <i>she was the
mayor</i> <i>of a small town</i>

389
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:12,768
<i>with 10,000 people.</i>

390
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:15,537
She undercuts your
best attack on Obama

391
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:17,606
that he's too inexperienced.

392
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,107
Well, that's played out.

393
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,576
We lose by five if we stick
with experience.

394
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:26,280
You think she's ready
to be president?

395
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,350
I don't think she's gonna
be ready on January 20th,

396
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:34,121
but I think she has the smarts
to get there eventually.

397
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,257
Give me
the bottom line, a.B.

398
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:41,260
High risk...

399
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:43,396
High reward.

400
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:46,733
You shouldn't have
told me that.

401
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:47,868
Why not?

402
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:52,105
I've been a risk-taker
all my life.

403
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:08,653
- Hi.
- Hi. How are ya?

404
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:10,121
Great.

405
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:11,389
Thanks so much for coming.

406
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:13,257
Thank you for having me
at your beautiful house.

407
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,860
Well, come on in.
Please.

408
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:20,797
( Indistinct chatter )

409
00:19:20,832 --> 00:19:23,333
John: One of the things
I'm most proud of, Sarah,

410
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,435
is my independence.

411
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:27,270
And I'm very impressed
with how you've bucked

412
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:29,706
the republican
establishment in Alaska.

413
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:32,374
Well, I am wired to be kind
of independent there also.

414
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:34,710
And I thought if I'm gonna
truly run the state

415
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:37,013
on behalf of the people,
I'm gonna have to do it

416
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,314
without that
good ole boy network.

417
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,952
I love the way you squashed
Stevens' bridge to nowhere.

418
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:46,355
Yeah. I am pro-growth

419
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:48,389
and pro-infrastructure
for Alaska,

420
00:19:48,424 --> 00:19:51,159
but not at the expense
of the American taxpayer.

421
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:53,194
I told congress
if we wanted a bridge,

422
00:19:53,228 --> 00:19:55,196
we'd build it ourselves.

423
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,699
You remind me of myself.

424
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,434
We're both reformers
who are not afraid

425
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,002
to thumb our nose
at our own party.

426
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:03,337
Senator, you're
an American hero.

427
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:07,441
I'm just Sarah
from Alaska.

428
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,914
What do you guys think?

429
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:16,584
I know a guy
like Tim pawlenty

430
00:20:16,618 --> 00:20:18,151
isn't exactly
the game-changing pick

431
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:19,652
you all seem
to think we need,

432
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,153
but he's young,
he's energetic.

433
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:24,123
He has solid
conservative credentials.

434
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:26,926
<i>With pawlenty,</i>
<i>we make the base happy.</i>

435
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:29,596
<i>And we know what the hell</i>
<i>we're getting.</i>

436
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,330
Pawlenty's ready
to be president.

437
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,966
Steve?

438
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,401
Well, there are
unknowns with Palin,

439
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,671
and certainly
it could go bad.

440
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:43,174
But if it were me, I'd
rather lose by 10 points

441
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,443
going for the win
than lose by one point

442
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,979
and look back
and say, "God damn,"

443
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,714
we should have gone
for the win."

444
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,985
Salter: <i>Our slogan's</i>
<i>"country first."</i>

445
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,588
Lieberman and pawlenty
are country-first choices.

446
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:00,825
Sarah Palin
will be perceived

447
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,360
as a self-serving
political maneuver.

448
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:10,166
You may not only lose
the election, John.

449
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,869
You just might lose your
reputation right along with it.

450
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:15,739
I'm not running
for my reputation.

451
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:18,975
I'm running
to be president.

452
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:21,811
Yes, sir.

<i>( Bell dings )</i>

454
00:21:30,186 --> 00:21:31,820
It is absolutely crucial

455
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:33,822
that not a single person
know you're the pick.

456
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:36,525
Surprise of your announcement
will stop any momentum

457
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,927
Obama might get from
his convention speech.

458
00:21:38,962 --> 00:21:40,594
That's smart.

459
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,304
You seem totally unfazed
by all this.

460
00:21:51,573 --> 00:21:53,808
It's God's plan.

461
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:07,054
This election has
never been about me.

We gotta get her ready

She had the project squashed

but ran on a platform
to build the bridge.

651
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,173
It's a huge flip-flop.

You're gonna have

I can assure you
that Obama's people

00:32:16,258 --> 00:32:19,927
by the national media that are
outrageous and disgusting.

673
00:32:19,962 --> 00:32:22,830
I have been asked
when her amniotic fluid

674
00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:25,599
started to leak with regard
to her last birth.

675
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:27,034
It's shameful.

676
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:28,702
So when did it
start leaking?

677
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:30,503
She's fought
the oil companies.

678
00:32:30,537 --> 00:32:32,939
She's taken on corrupt
special interests.

679
00:32:32,974 --> 00:32:35,508
These accusations
are totally sexist.

680
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:38,145
Never in my life
have I seen a candidate

681
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:40,613
more attacked by
the liberal media.

682
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:43,183
Smear after smear
after smear.

683
00:32:43,217 --> 00:32:45,818
Are you sure
we have to do this?

684
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:47,419
Bristol couldn't stop crying
when I told her.

685
00:32:47,453 --> 00:32:48,988
Are youit's going to
we havecome out tomorrow

686
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:50,489
with or without
our statement, Governor.

687
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:51,924
A positive from this

688
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,793
is that given the timing
of Bristol's pregnancy,

689
00:32:53,827 --> 00:32:56,762
it makes it physically impossible
for Trig to be her baby.

690
00:32:56,797 --> 00:33:00,766
<i>So we can put that</i>
<i>absurd rumor to rest.</i>

691
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,501
"We're proud of Bristol's
decision to have her baby

692
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:06,504
and even prouder
to become grandparents."

693
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:07,972
We're not proud

694
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:10,842
that our teenage daughter
is pregnant, Maria.

695
00:33:10,876 --> 00:33:13,178
And I don't want to send
a message that teen pregnancy

696
00:33:13,212 --> 00:33:15,313
is something to be proud of.

697
00:33:15,347 --> 00:33:17,114
I want that line out.

698
00:33:17,148 --> 00:33:19,549
Of course, Governor.
I'll change it right away.

699
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,553
Reporter: <i>Governor Palin's</i>

701
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:28,758
<i>What the American people</i>
<i>didn't know until today</i>

702
00:33:28,793 --> 00:33:31,528
<i>is that Bristol</i>

703
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:33,196

<i>this statement:</i>

704
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,698
<i>"We're proud of Bristol's</i>

705
00:33:35,732 --> 00:33:37,533
I specifically wanted
that line taken out,

706
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:39,168
and you ran it
without changing a word.

707
00:33:39,203 --> 00:33:40,436
Rick:
<i>You're absolutely right.</i>

708
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,738
The campaign takes full
responsibility on this.

709
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,673
Maria's gonna personally
apologize to you.

710
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,342
How the flip
did this happen?

711
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:47,977
Senator McCain is somewhat

712
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:50,312
a fly-by-the-seat-
of-his-pants type of guy,

713
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:52,914
and it does occasionally create
a little chaos in the campaign.

714
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,749
Well, I want Maria gone.

715
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,618
Governor, this was a mistake.
Maria feels terrible.

716
00:33:57,653 --> 00:34:00,255
She's an excellent
press secretary.

717
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:02,157
My 17-year-old daughter
is being made fun of

718
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:03,859
by every talk show host
in the country.

719
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:06,961
I want Maria gone, period.

720
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:10,164
Of course, Governor.
She's gone.

721
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:12,333
Done.

722
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:15,970
Who makes that call?

723
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:18,305
- That'd be you.
- ( Sighs )

724
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,307
The idea that if something
happened to John McCain

725
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:24,810
<i>who is 72 years old</i> <i>and who has
had two bouts</i> <i>with melanoma,</i>

726
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:26,946
- <i>and she could step</i> <i>into the presidency--</i>
- <i>( Knock at door )</i>

727
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,447
- <i>It's just ridiculous.</i>
- <i>( Channel changes )</i>

728
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:29,949
Man:
<i>The real sequence, Rachel,</i>

729
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,618
<i>is she said "please"</i>
<i>and "thank you,"</i>

730
00:34:32,652 --> 00:34:35,154
and then "thanks,
but no thanks,"

731
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:39,724
only when the congress
had de-authorized the bridge...

732
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:42,227
Hi, Governor.
I just wanted to check in,

733
00:34:42,262 --> 00:34:44,796
make sure
you're doing okay.

734
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,932
Should John McCain consider
replacing Sarah Palin

735
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:48,767
<i>on the gop ticket?</i>

736
00:34:48,801 --> 00:34:50,269
I want to talk
to the press.

737
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:52,970
I want to set the record
straight on this stuff.

738
00:34:54,106 --> 00:34:56,908
I'll just go put
trig's p.J.S on.

739
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:58,475
Hey, there.

740
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,178
- There you go, baby.
- Just gonna put your PJ's on.

741
00:35:01,213 --> 00:35:04,048
Now, we don't want you
to talk to anyone

742
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:07,518
until after
the convention

743
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:11,021
<i>because no one knows</i>
<i>anything about you.</i>

744
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:13,689
If you answer these
ridiculous allegations,

745
00:35:13,724 --> 00:35:17,961
you'll be defining yourself
in a defensive posture.

746
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:19,729
But isn't the press
defining me right now?

747
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:23,800
No news story lasts
more than 48 hours any more.

748
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:26,135
<i>News is no longer</i>
<i>meant to be remembered.</i>

749
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:27,569
It's just entertainment.

750
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:30,672
So if you hit your convention
speech out of the park,

751
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:35,677
the next news cycle will be
the comeback of Sarah Palin.

752
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:38,647
Yeah. I can do that.

753
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:42,250
Now, everyone's heard a lot
of crazy stories about you.

754
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:45,586
Now it's time for you to tell
the world who you really are.

755
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:50,425
You tell Senator McCain
I won't let him down.

756
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:53,694
And good evening from the g.O.
P. Convention in St. Paul.

757
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,696
All eyes will be
on Senator McCain's

758
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,998
V.P. Choice,
Governor Sarah Palin,

759
00:35:58,032 --> 00:36:00,033
when she takes the stage
at the r.N.C.

760
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:02,035
She's likely
never seen a night

761
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,971
fraught with
so much anticipation,

762
00:36:04,005 --> 00:36:06,106
<i>expectation and pressure.</i>

763
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:10,677
The food's terrible, but I hear
it's gonna be worse in Iraq.

764
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:14,613
- My boy's so brave.
- Come on, mom.

765
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,886
Thank you for inviting me,
Mrs. Palin.

766
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,055
Thank you for cutting
your mullet, levi.

767
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,823
I really appreciate it.

768
00:36:24,858 --> 00:36:26,492
I didn't really
want to at first,

769
00:36:26,526 --> 00:36:29,427
but I think it looks
way better now.

770
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:32,830
I think it does, too.

771
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:36,201
Sorry to interrupt,

772
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,903
but the palins need
to go to their seats.

773
00:36:38,937 --> 00:36:40,972
- Bye, mom.
- Okay.

774
00:36:49,614 --> 00:36:52,316
I don't know.
I don't know.

775
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,351
Hey, she's gonna
be fine.

776
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:57,187
- Really?
- Absolutely.

777
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:00,590
Is she gonna be okay?

778
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:03,359
I'm more concerned
about one on ones.

779
00:37:03,394 --> 00:37:04,827
How bad?

780
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:08,064
I'm not sure how much she
knows about foreign policy.

781
00:37:08,098 --> 00:37:10,666
She didn't know why North and South
Korea were different countries.

782
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,502
( Sighs )

783
00:37:12,536 --> 00:37:15,304
Okay, let's keep
the press away from her.

784
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:17,506
We have five days
to bring her up to speed.

785
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,973
She'll be fine.

786
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:21,009
Shshe's on in five minutes.
I've gotta get up there.

787
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:22,644
Good luck.

00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,380
It broke halfway
through her speech.

851
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:00,715
- You're kidding.
- No.

852
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,917
If that happens to me
tomorrow night, I'm fucked.

853
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:05,086
( Crowd cheering )

854
00:41:07,022 --> 00:41:08,356
We can win this!

861
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:27,073
Thank you for calling.
Yes, we do take credit cards.

862
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:29,575
- I'd be happy to...
- I've got $500.

863
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:32,178
We're grateful for
every dollar we get.

864
00:41:32,212 --> 00:41:34,947
Yes, Sarah Palin will be giving
a speech in Florida this week.

865
00:41:34,982 --> 00:41:36,816
Thanks.

866
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,118
Hey. Here we go.

867
00:41:39,153 --> 00:41:41,019
- Thanks for coming.
- I love you.

868
00:41:41,053 --> 00:41:45,090
( Chuckles )
Hi. Hey. Hi.

869
00:41:45,124 --> 00:41:47,959
- God, this is crazy.
- I know, they really love her.

870
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:52,063
Sarah:
<i>How are ya? Hey.</i>

871
00:41:53,499 --> 00:41:55,167
- Hey, what's your name?
- I'm Sarah.

872
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:56,734
- ( Gasps ) Sarah?
- Yeah.

873
00:41:56,769 --> 00:41:59,369
That's my name, too.
That's amazing!

874
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:01,272
- I know.
- Oh!

875
00:42:01,306 --> 00:42:02,506
Hey, thanks for coming out.

876
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,574
Thank you.
We never felt welcome to go anywhere

877
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:06,443
before we saw you
give that speech.

878
00:42:06,477 --> 00:42:08,946
Oh, thank you.
Thanks so much.

879
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,348
Look at you.
I want to look at how handsome

880
00:42:11,382 --> 00:42:13,950
my son Trig's gonna be
when he's all grown up.

881
00:42:13,984 --> 00:42:16,853
She understands that you can't
solve problems with government,

882
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:18,521
that government
is the problem.

883
00:42:18,555 --> 00:42:21,691
When she talks about her faith,
you can tell it's for real.

884
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:24,828
When she talks about guns,
you can tell it's for real.

885
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:26,562
I've got five kids, too,

886
00:42:26,596 --> 00:42:28,097
and there's
something about her--

887
00:42:28,132 --> 00:42:31,466
she's talking to me.
And nobody talks to me.

888
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:37,172
CNN has us even
with Obama.

889
00:42:37,207 --> 00:42:40,108
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, Gallup has us up by five.

890
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:41,844
She's given us
exactly what we needed.

891
00:42:41,878 --> 00:42:43,745
We've made more money
in the last few days

892
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:45,179
than we did
all last month.

893
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:47,281
I've never seen crowds
like this in my life.

894
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,351
- They love her.
- She's a bigger star than Obama.

895
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:52,786
We can really
win this thing.

896
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:00,927
I really understand
your frustr--

897
00:43:00,962 --> 00:43:02,762
I'm sorry, pool.
It's not gonna happen today.

898
00:43:02,796 --> 00:43:04,331
- ( Reporters clamoring )
- Sorry.

899
00:43:04,365 --> 00:43:06,466
- Five minutes!
- Views matter.

900
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,269
Did you know that
Todd Palin is an Eskimo?

901
00:43:09,303 --> 00:43:11,771
Oh, yeah, Steve?
That's really interesting.

902
00:43:11,805 --> 00:43:14,707
Seriously,
he's a Yupik Eskimo.

903
00:43:14,742 --> 00:43:16,609
We're gonna take some serious
blowback from the press

904
00:43:16,643 --> 00:43:18,310
if we don't let them
speak to her soon.

905
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,746
- They're really getting pissed.
- I know, yeah.

906
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,814
Well, I don't know
how ready she is.

907
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:25,317
Nicolle,
you worry too much.

908
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,753
We always knew she'd
be weak on foreign policy.

909
00:43:27,787 --> 00:43:29,321
We'll get her up to speed.

910
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:33,292
Steve, I don't think foreign
policy is her only weakness.

911
00:43:36,596 --> 00:43:38,730
Sorry to bother you,
governor. Okayto talk?

912
00:43:38,765 --> 00:43:41,366
Sure, I'm just reading the e-mails
from the prayer warriors.

913
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:43,268
These guys are awesome.

914
00:43:43,302 --> 00:43:45,704
I just want to take
a moment to inform you

915
00:43:45,738 --> 00:43:48,673
of how thrilled
Senator McCain is.

916
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:51,375
You're exceeding
his wildest expectation

917
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,143
for what a running mate
could achieve.

918
00:43:53,177 --> 00:43:55,245
I am so happy to hear that.

919
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,648
These are the largest crowds
I've ever seen

920
00:43:57,682 --> 00:43:59,884
in my entire
political career, ever.

921
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:01,452
Really? Yeah, I just--

922
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:03,987
I just love talking
to people on the rope lines,

923
00:44:04,022 --> 00:44:05,555
<i>getting to hear</i>
<i>their problems.</i>

924
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:07,957
It's-- it's really
moving to me.

925
00:44:07,991 --> 00:44:09,793
<i>Well, you know,</i>
<i>that comes across.</i>

926
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:12,161
You're a transformative
figure, Governor.

927
00:44:12,195 --> 00:44:15,632
You-- you could be the
party's next Ronald Reagan.

928
00:44:15,666 --> 00:44:18,134
Holy jeez, I--

929
00:44:18,168 --> 00:44:21,137
yeah, he's--
he's my hero, so...

930
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:24,073
Mine, too.
So, uh...

931
00:44:24,107 --> 00:44:27,476
The next step is just-- we're gonna
start doing some interviews.

932
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,578
Great. I've been dying
to talk to the press.

933
00:44:29,612 --> 00:44:32,081
Also, I feel like I could
really help you there.

934
00:44:32,115 --> 00:44:35,517
<i>I've always been</i> <i>very, very
open with</i> <i>the press in Alaska.</i>

935
00:44:35,552 --> 00:44:37,686
The reasoning behind
holding you back

936
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,322
is the entire press corps
is in the tank for Obama,

937
00:44:40,356 --> 00:44:41,756
so all they want in life

938
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,125
is to trip you up
with obscure questions.

939
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,027
- Gotcha questions.
- Gotcha questions.

940
00:44:46,062 --> 00:44:47,963
So we just want to make sure
you're fully prepped

941
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:49,664
before we unleash them.

942
00:44:49,698 --> 00:44:51,666
What about the local
Alaska papers?

943
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,568
There are no
local papers any more.

944
00:44:53,602 --> 00:44:56,937
Anything you say goes national
the instant you say it.

945
00:44:56,972 --> 00:44:58,138
Yeah, got it.

946
00:44:58,173 --> 00:45:01,275
Okay, so I think
the best way to prep

947
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:03,510
would just be to go through
some sample questions.

948
00:45:03,544 --> 00:45:05,012
<i>Sure, let's do it.</i>

949
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:07,948
Um, let's start with
something simple.

950
00:45:07,983 --> 00:45:11,317
Uh... how do you
plan on maintaining

951
00:45:11,352 --> 00:45:13,919
our alliance with
greabrbritain on Iraq,

952
00:45:13,954 --> 00:45:15,921
even though support
for the war there

953
00:45:15,956 --> 00:45:17,457
is at an all-time low?

954
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:21,961
I think the United States
has always maintained

955
00:45:21,996 --> 00:45:23,562
a great relationship
with the queen.

956
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:26,331
And John McCain
will continue to have

957
00:45:26,366 --> 00:45:28,433
an open dialogue with her.

958
00:45:29,302 --> 00:45:30,702
Uh, Governor,

959
00:45:30,736 --> 00:45:33,738
the queen is not the head
of government in england.

960
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,240
She's the head of state.

961
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,842
Well, then, who's
the head of government?

962
00:45:39,012 --> 00:45:41,046
The prime minister.

963
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,188
<i>( Indistinct chatter )</i>

964
00:46:02,866 --> 00:46:04,267
You rang?

965
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:06,636
- The cavalry has arrived.
- ( Chuckles )

966
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:08,971
- Thank you, gentlemen. Come on in.
- You bet.

967
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:10,606
Yeah.

968
00:46:18,681 --> 00:46:20,549
Well, I, uh--

969
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:22,484
I think we should start
by prepping the governor

970
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:24,719
with Russian
economic policy

971
00:46:24,754 --> 00:46:27,456
as it relates to
post-cold war tensions

972
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,091
during the pre-putin era.

973
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:32,460
I was thinking something
a little bit simpler.

974
00:46:32,494 --> 00:46:33,695
How much simpler?

975
00:46:33,729 --> 00:46:36,130
This is Germany.

976
00:46:36,165 --> 00:46:38,567
They were
the primary antagonists

977
00:46:38,601 --> 00:46:40,869
during world war I
and world war ii.

978
00:46:40,903 --> 00:46:43,071
Biegun: <i>And in world war ii
,</i> <i>they were aligned with</i>

979
00:46:43,105 --> 00:46:47,575
Japan and Italy to form
what was known as the axis.

980
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:52,880
Randy: <i>Currently,</i>
<i>we're in the middle</i> okay.

981
00:46:52,914 --> 00:46:55,215
Of what I like to call
the three wars.

982
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:59,720
That's Afghanistan, Iraq,
and the global war on terror.

983
00:46:59,754 --> 00:47:03,355
Governor, would you-- would
you like to take a break?

984
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,793
No way.
This is flippin' awesome.

985
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:13,866
Now, with Afghanistan,
after 9/11...

986
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:16,135
Reporter: <i>...
Already put</i> <i>a protective wall up</i>

( Sobbing )

996
00:47:42,628 --> 00:47:45,295
Any grownup who makes fun
of a teenage girl

997
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,031
is a terrible person.

998
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:49,166
And we'll forget what
she said, honey, okay?

999
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,767
Okay?

1000
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:53,302
My e-mails were hacked.

1001
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,872
I know, governor, and we're on it.
I promise you.

00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,507
<i>Did you know that</i>

Did you know that my family

1005
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:07,482

Nicolle:
<i>Charlie Gibson is good,</i>

1012
00:48:27,136 --> 00:48:29,737
so I'm sure the questions
will have some depth.

1013
00:48:29,772 --> 00:48:32,140
Don't be afraid to elaborate
if it's a subject

you feel comfortable with,

Are you okay, Governor?

1016
00:48:38,213 --> 00:48:42,315
Why aren't there any McCain-Palin
lawn signs in Alaska?

1017
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:45,185
Well, Mr. Obama

1018
00:48:45,219 --> 00:48:47,253
has five times
the money we have.

1019
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:50,057
Five times, and...

1020
00:48:50,091 --> 00:48:54,027
Alaska is only three electoral
votes, and it's solid red.

1021
00:48:54,062 --> 00:48:56,128
I'm concerned about
my standing back home.

1022
00:48:56,163 --> 00:48:57,629
Todd and
are hearing things,

1023
00:48:57,664 --> 00:48:59,865
and I can't talk
to the Alaskan press.

1024
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,366
What are you hearing?

1025
00:49:01,401 --> 00:49:03,435
Things.
None of it's good.

1026
00:49:03,469 --> 00:49:06,839
Can you at least do a poll to
check my approval rating there?

1027
00:49:06,873 --> 00:49:09,775
Governor, that would cost
the campaign $60,000.

1028
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:11,843
I'd feel a heck
of a lot better

1029
00:49:11,877 --> 00:49:14,179
if I knew where I was at.

1030
00:49:16,115 --> 00:49:18,616
Absolutely.
We will do the poll

1031
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,551
for your peace of mind,
just this once.

1032
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:22,086
Sarah:
<i>Great. Thank you.</i>

1033
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,422
So, can we get back to
prepping Charlie Gibson?

1034
00:49:24,456 --> 00:49:25,923
Sure, I'm ready.
Let's do it.

1035
00:49:25,957 --> 00:49:28,626
- You ready?
- Yes.

1036
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:32,196
Do you think the fed
did the right thing

1037
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:34,197
in their dealing with
the bear stearns collapse?

1038
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,202
Our economy is hurting,
and the federal government

1039
00:49:39,237 --> 00:49:41,170
has not provided
the sound oversight

1040
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:43,640
that we need
and that we deserve.

1041
00:49:43,674 --> 00:49:47,009
I think we need
a little bit of reality

1042
00:49:47,044 --> 00:49:48,645
from wasilla
main street there

1043
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:52,481
brought to Washington, D.C.,
so that the people there

1044
00:49:52,515 --> 00:49:56,385
can understand how the
average working-class family

1045
00:49:56,419 --> 00:49:59,455
is viewing bureaucracy
in the federal government.

1046
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:01,523
( Clears throat )
Governor...

1047
00:50:01,558 --> 00:50:03,191
Do you know
what the fed is?

1048
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:06,961
In what respect, Charlie?

1049
00:50:06,995 --> 00:50:09,364
No, no.
This is me, Steve,

1050
00:50:09,398 --> 00:50:11,766
asking do you know
what the fed is?

1051
00:50:16,838 --> 00:50:18,939
Um...
( Clears throat )

1052
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,708
Stands for the federal
reserve system.

1053
00:50:21,743 --> 00:50:24,210
No, please.
Don't write, just listen.

1054
00:50:24,245 --> 00:50:27,581
The fed is responsible
for all monetary policy

1055
00:50:27,615 --> 00:50:29,082
in the United States.

1056
00:50:29,116 --> 00:50:30,950
On any fed or
bear stearns question,

1057
00:50:30,985 --> 00:50:32,519
just say the fed took
the appropriate action

1058
00:50:32,553 --> 00:50:35,289
that was needed
at the time.

1059
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,890
Okay?

1060
00:50:39,493 --> 00:50:41,226
Got it.

1061
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:47,065
Your oldest son is proudly
heading off to Iraq next week.

1062
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,068
Who do you see as the primary
enemy at this point?

1063
00:50:50,103 --> 00:50:53,272
Radical islamist extremists.

1064
00:50:53,306 --> 00:50:54,906
Can you be more specific?

1065
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,108
The terrorists
who are hell-bent

1066
00:50:57,142 --> 00:50:59,311
on destroying our nation.

1067
00:50:59,345 --> 00:51:01,112
Governor, do you know
why we're in Iraq?

1068
00:51:01,146 --> 00:51:05,216
Because Saddam Hussein
attacked us on 9/11.

1069
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,719
No. No, uh,

1070
00:51:07,753 --> 00:51:09,886
Al qaeda attacked us
on 9/11.

1071
00:51:09,921 --> 00:51:11,422
Not Saddam Hussein.

1072
00:51:11,456 --> 00:51:13,089
No, it was Al qaeda.

1073
00:51:13,124 --> 00:51:15,459
And that's why
we're in Afghanistan.

1074
00:51:15,493 --> 00:51:17,461
Do you know
the primary differences

1075
00:51:17,495 --> 00:51:19,830
between the war in Afghanistan
and the war in Iraq?

1076
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:27,503
Steve: Um, excuse
us for a moment.

1077
00:51:35,412 --> 00:51:37,814
Can I get some more information
about Afghanistan?

1078
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:39,749
Of course, Governor.

1079
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:51,893
- Should we cancel?
- We can't.

1080
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:53,995
Even fox is pounding us
for hiding her.

1081
00:51:54,029 --> 00:51:56,531
- We'd get murdered.
- When you interviewed her,

1082
00:51:56,566 --> 00:51:58,599
didn't you ask her
about national security?

1083
00:51:58,633 --> 00:52:01,802
Foreign policy,
domeicic policy?

1084
00:52:01,837 --> 00:52:03,637
I thought culvahouse
would cover that.

1085
00:52:03,672 --> 00:52:05,473
So what did you ask her?

1086
00:52:05,507 --> 00:52:09,009
I just-- we talked
about if she would

1087
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:12,045
back John's positions
when they conflicted with hers

1088
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,414
or if she was prepared
for her life to change.

1089
00:52:14,415 --> 00:52:16,949
There were no
policy questions.

1090
00:52:16,984 --> 00:52:20,687
You guys didn't grill her
because you wanted it to work.

1091
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,556
I wasn't in charge
of the vet, nicolle.

1092
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:30,796
She's a great actress, right?

1093
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,131
Oh, the best.

1094
00:52:33,165 --> 00:52:35,967
Why don't we just
give her some lines?

1095
00:52:39,205 --> 00:52:40,972
<i>( Bell dings )</i>

1096
00:52:42,141 --> 00:52:43,842
I've come up with
a list of questions

1097
00:52:43,877 --> 00:52:45,676
that I think Charlie's
most likely to ask.

1098
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:47,111
If you memorize
these answers,

1099
00:52:47,145 --> 00:52:48,846
I'm sure y'r're going
to nail this interview.

1100
00:52:48,881 --> 00:52:50,381
How do you know
he'll ask these?

1101
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:51,849
I was the white house
communications director.

1102
00:52:51,884 --> 00:52:54,151
It's my job to figure out
the questions.

1103
00:52:54,185 --> 00:52:55,553
"Shushkashvili."

1104
00:52:55,587 --> 00:52:57,955
Saakashvili,
the president of Georgia.

1105
00:52:57,989 --> 00:52:59,690
Shashkashvili.

1106
00:52:59,725 --> 00:53:01,792
Saakashvith--

1107
00:53:01,826 --> 00:53:04,461
- saakashvili.
- Saakash-vili.

1108
00:53:04,495 --> 00:53:06,329
Let me ask you
about some specific

1109
00:53:06,363 --> 00:53:08,097
- national security situations.
- Sure.

1110
00:53:08,132 --> 00:53:09,933
Let's start with Russia
and Georgia.

1111
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:12,001
Do you believe
the United States

1112
00:53:12,036 --> 00:53:14,671
should try to restore
Georgian sovereignty

1113
00:53:14,705 --> 00:53:16,740
over South ossetia
and abkhazia?

1114
00:53:16,774 --> 00:53:18,240
First off,
we're gonna continue

1115
00:53:18,274 --> 00:53:19,708
good relations
with saakashvili there.

1116

<i>I was able to speak</i>
<i>with him the other day,</i>

1117
00:53:22,345 --> 00:53:24,547
and we've gotta
keep an eye on Russia.

1118
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:26,982
For Russia to have
exerted such pressure

1119
00:53:27,016 --> 00:53:31,620
in terms of invading a smaller
Democratic country unprovoked

1120
00:53:31,655 --> 00:53:33,922
- is unacceptable, and we have--
- You believe unprovoked?

1121
00:53:33,956 --> 00:53:36,357
- Yes.
- I do, I do believe unprovoked.

The president's massive
financial rescue plan

1182
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:11,226
under fire from
the left and right.

1183
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,895
Biegun: <i>Good evening
from</i> <i>the Ford center</i>

1184
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,397
<i>at the university</i>
<i>of Mississippi at Oxford.</i>

1185
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,499
We're here for the first
of three debates

1186
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:19,000
between Senator
Barack Obama--

1187
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,036
Steve, Steve, let's not
worry about that crap.

1188
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,671
It's all bullshit.

1189
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,338
I'm here at the podium.

1190
00:57:24,373 --> 00:57:26,941
- Let's do the fucking debate.
- <i>( Door opens )</i>

1191
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,811
Hey, John.
Sorry to interrupt.

1192
00:57:29,845 --> 00:57:32,681
I just spoke to our guy
at treasury.

1193
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:35,582
The bill does not have
enough republican votes.

1194
00:57:35,616 --> 00:57:36,917
God damn it.

1195
00:57:36,951 --> 00:57:38,952
Paulson thinks
the entire world economy

1196
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:41,889
is on the brink of falling
off the cliff, so...

1197
00:57:41,923 --> 00:57:45,292
We're checkmated.
If the bail-out doesn't pass,

1198
00:57:45,326 --> 00:57:47,494
we're screwed because
bush, and thus you,

1199
00:57:47,528 --> 00:57:49,196
will be blamed for it.

1200
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,998
- If you pass the bail-out--
- The Republicans will despise me

1201
00:57:52,032 --> 00:57:54,467
- for supporting a bail-out.
- Rick: <i>That's it.</i>

1202
00:57:55,736 --> 00:57:57,504
This is it, guys.

1203
00:57:57,538 --> 00:57:59,972
I mean, this is
the whole fucking election.

1204
00:58:00,007 --> 00:58:03,042
Now, we think you should
suspend the campaign,

1205
00:58:03,077 --> 00:58:05,579
postpone the debates,
go to Washington,

1206
00:58:05,613 --> 00:58:09,281
and try to negotiate
a bi-partisan compromise.

1207
00:58:09,316 --> 00:58:12,218
You need to make
a bold move, John.

1208
00:58:14,153 --> 00:58:16,154
This is a big risk.

1209
00:58:16,189 --> 00:58:18,890
I mean,
that's a big gamble.

1210
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,228
We gotta do something.

1211
00:58:22,262 --> 00:58:25,396
I mean nothing can fuck me
more than this.

1212
00:58:25,431 --> 00:58:26,964
Nicolle: <i>Governor, have
you</i> <i>had a chance</i>

1213
00:58:26,998 --> 00:58:29,934
<i>to go over the briefing</i>
<i>materials on the bail-out?</i>

1214
00:58:32,238 --> 00:58:34,071
I really think we need
to try and nail down

1215
00:58:34,106 --> 00:58:36,541
a simple two-sentence response
to the economic crisis.

1216
00:58:36,575 --> 00:58:39,443
- It's gotta be supportive of the concept...
- That's enough powder.

1217
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:42,279
...Of the bail-out, but also
disappointed that we're at this point,

1218
00:58:42,313 --> 00:58:45,682
making it clear that changes
need to be made to the bill.

1219
00:58:47,151 --> 00:58:48,619
Oh, you need it
a little higher?

1220
00:58:48,653 --> 00:58:51,020
I can do that.
I can do that for you.

1221
00:58:52,423 --> 00:58:54,791
That jacket looks fantastic
on you, by the way.

1222
00:58:54,825 --> 00:58:56,859
It's too open.

1223
00:58:56,893 --> 00:58:59,662
- Don't you think so
- Yeah, it looks wonderful.

1224
00:58:59,696 --> 00:59:01,196
Really great,
really nice.

1225
00:59:01,231 --> 00:59:03,132
It's a great color.

1226
00:59:09,306 --> 00:59:11,740
Do you want me to read
the paper to you?

1227
00:59:16,812 --> 00:59:20,681
"Senator John McCain has requested of
his opponent, Senator Barack Obama,"

1228
00:59:20,715 --> 00:59:23,117
a postponement
of the upcoming debate

1229
00:59:23,152 --> 00:59:25,686
so that both Senators
may return to Capitol Hill

1230
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,522
to address the needs of the
country in this crucial time.

1231
00:59:28,556 --> 00:59:30,424
"Senator Obama has said--"

1232
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:38,331
I hate this make-up.
I hate it.

1233
00:59:38,365 --> 00:59:40,733
I don't like my hair this way.
I like my hair up.

1234
00:59:40,768 --> 00:59:42,468
Governor,
you look amazing.

1235
00:59:42,503 --> 00:59:46,506
I look fat.
I'm sick of looking fat.

1236
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:49,709
- You don't look fat--
- Can I get some more tape?

1237
00:59:51,144 --> 00:59:53,913
- ( Phone ring))
- Yeah.

1238
00:59:53,947 --> 00:59:55,848
I don't know
if we should do Couric.

1239
00:59:55,882 --> 00:59:57,482
She's having
a mini-meltdown.

1240
00:59:57,517 --> 00:59:59,818
Well, we can't have McCain
cancel the debate

1241
00:59:59,853 --> 01:00:02,788
and Palin cancel Katie Couric
in the same week.

1242
01:00:02,822 --> 01:00:04,456
I know,

1243
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:06,057
but I'm really worried
about her.

1244
01:00:06,091 --> 01:00:08,693
She won't respond
to anything I say.

1245
01:00:08,727 --> 01:00:11,128
<i>Maybe we should</i> <i>bring McCain
in and</i> <i>see what he thinks.</i>

1246
01:00:11,163 --> 01:00:12,830
He doesn't want
to deal with her.

1247
01:00:12,865 --> 01:00:15,600
I haven't even told him
that she doesn't know anything.

1248
01:00:15,634 --> 01:00:17,835
You haven't told him?

1249
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:20,572
Look, he doesn't
want to know.

1250
01:00:20,606 --> 01:00:22,706
<i>The world economy</i>
<i>is on the brink of collapse.</i>

1251
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,409
Can you just... prep her
in the car ride over?

1252
01:00:26,444 --> 01:00:30,180
Uh, I can try.

1253
01:00:30,214 --> 01:00:34,551
Okay, good.
Try. Thanks.

1254
01:00:34,586 --> 01:00:36,419
Knowing Katie, I'm sure
she's going to ask

1255
01:00:36,454 --> 01:00:38,420
<i>about your stance</i>
<i>on feminism.</i>

1256
01:00:38,455 --> 01:00:40,289
- Did you get the numbers?
- The what?

1257
01:00:40,323 --> 01:00:43,559
My approval rating
in Alaska.

1258
01:00:43,594 --> 01:00:45,628
They're not in yet.

1259
01:00:45,662 --> 01:00:47,296
I am trying
to trust you people,

1260
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:50,032
but you're making it
really hard for me.

1261
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:52,401
I'm sorry, Governor.

1262
01:00:52,435 --> 01:00:54,268
I'll call Steve
right away about it.

1263
01:00:54,303 --> 01:00:56,270
Yeah, like that'll
do anything.

1264
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:02,210
Nicolle: <i>What are you</i>
<i>working on, Governor?</i>

1265
01:01:03,879 --> 01:01:07,115
It's a questionnaire from the "mat-su
valley frontiersman" in wasilla.

1266
01:01:07,149 --> 01:01:09,117
You know,
an Alaska paper.

1267
01:01:09,151 --> 01:01:10,618
Don't you think
we should prepare

1268
01:01:10,652 --> 01:01:12,886
for your national
Couric interview first?

1269
01:01:12,921 --> 01:01:16,156
No, nicolle, I don't.
This is my priority.

1270
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:21,629
I am not going to ignore
the people of Alaska any more.

1271
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:34,541
You've cited Alaska's
proximity to Russia

1272
01:01:34,575 --> 01:01:36,843
as part of your foreign
policy experience.

1273
01:01:36,877 --> 01:01:38,111
What did you mean by that?

1274
01:01:38,146 --> 01:01:41,914
That Alaska has a very
narrow maritime border

1275
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:45,584
between a foreign country,
Russia, and on our other side,

1276
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:49,755
the land boundary
that we have with Canada.

1277
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,358
It's funny that
a comment like that

1278
01:01:52,392 --> 01:01:56,995
was kind of made to--
( Stammering )

1279
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,496
I don't know.
You know, reporters.

1280
01:01:58,531 --> 01:02:00,231
- Couric: <i>Mocked?</i>
- Sarah: <i>Yeah, mocked.</i>

1281
01:02:00,266 --> 01:02:01,666
<i>I guess that's</i>
<i>the word, yeah.</i>

1282
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,269
Well, explain to me
why that enhances

1283
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:06,271
your foreign policy
credentials.

1284
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:10,141
Well, it certainly
does because our--

1285
01:02:10,176 --> 01:02:12,677
our next-door neighbors
are foreign countries.

1286
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:16,713
They're in the state
that I am the executive of.

1287
01:02:16,747 --> 01:02:19,416
Have you ever been involved
with any negotiations,

1288
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:21,351
for example,
with the Russians?

1289
01:02:21,386 --> 01:02:23,353
We have trade missions
back and forth.

1290
01:02:23,388 --> 01:02:25,055
We do.
It's very important

1291
01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:28,458
<i>when you consider</i> <i>even national
security</i> <i>issues with Russia,</i>

1292
01:02:28,493 --> 01:02:31,960
as putin rears his head
and comes into the airspace

1293
01:02:31,995 --> 01:02:34,129
of the United States
of America,

1294
01:02:34,164 --> 01:02:35,964
where do they go?

1295
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:38,967
<i>It's Alaska.</i> <i>It's just
right</i> <i>over the border.</i>

1296
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:41,370
Katie: <i>And when it comes to</i>
<i>establishing your world-view,</i>

1297
01:02:41,405 --> 01:02:45,040
<i>I was curious--</i> <i>what
newspapers</i> <i>and magazines</i>

1298
01:02:45,075 --> 01:02:49,311
did you regularly read before
you were tapped for this

1299
01:02:49,345 --> 01:02:51,112
to stay informed
and to understand--

1300
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:54,216
Sarah: <i>I've read most of them,</i>
<i>again with a great appreciation</i>

1301
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,384
for the press,
for the media.

1302
01:02:56,419 --> 01:02:58,886
What ones specifically?
I'm curious.

1303
01:02:58,921 --> 01:03:00,555
Name one fucking paper.

1304
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:02,423
All of 'Em.
Any of 'Em

1305
01:03:02,457 --> 01:03:05,626
<i>that have been in front of me</i>
<i>over all these years.</i>

1306
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:08,596
Oh, my God.
What have we done?

1307
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:11,298
If John McCain wins,
this woman will be

1308
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:14,000
one 72-year-old's
heartbeat away

1309
01:03:14,035 --> 01:03:16,737
from president
of the United States.

1310
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:19,272
And if that doesn't scare
the hell out of you, it should.

1311
01:03:19,306 --> 01:03:21,407
In fairness,
probably most people

1312
01:03:21,442 --> 01:03:24,043
can't name
a supreme court case.

1313
01:03:24,077 --> 01:03:26,579
But most people
are not campaigning

1314
01:03:26,614 --> 01:03:28,214
- to be vice president.
- Right, right.

1315
01:03:28,249 --> 01:03:30,983
It's not that she doesn't
know the right answer.

1316
01:03:31,017 --> 01:03:34,120
It's that she clearly does not
understand the question.

1317
01:03:34,154 --> 01:03:37,689
This is way beyond
anything we have ever seen

1318
01:03:37,724 --> 01:03:39,491
from a national candidate.

1319
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:45,564
Why'd you make me
do Katie Couric?

1320
01:03:45,598 --> 01:03:48,667
<i>Did you see the coverage?</i>
<i>Did you?</i>

1321
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:50,801
Are you there?
Are you listening to me?

1322
01:03:50,835 --> 01:03:52,936
Yes, Governor.
I'm here.

1323
01:03:52,971 --> 01:03:54,438
Katie was a logical choice.

1324
01:03:54,473 --> 01:03:56,474
She's been very fair to us
this entire campaign.

1325
01:03:56,508 --> 01:03:57,841
You call that interview fair?

1326
01:03:57,876 --> 01:03:59,510
Yes, Governor, I do.

1327
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:02,480
I certainly don't.
She was out to get me from the get-go.

1328
01:04:02,514 --> 01:04:03,881
No, she wasn't.

1329
01:04:03,915 --> 01:04:05,383
The interview sucked
because you didn't try.

1330
01:04:05,417 --> 01:04:07,216
What do you mean,
I didn't try?

1331
01:04:07,251 --> 01:04:08,618
You didn't fight back
like you did

1332
01:04:08,653 --> 01:04:09,753
in the Charlie Gibson
interview.

1333
01:04:09,787 --> 01:04:10,987
<i>When you didn't</i>
<i>know the answers,</i>

1334
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:12,722
you clawed your way back
and it went fine.

1335
01:04:12,757 --> 01:04:14,457
You just gave up.

1336
01:04:14,492 --> 01:04:16,326
Nicolle, it wasn't my fault.

1337
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:18,261
I wasn't properly prepped.

1338
01:04:18,296 --> 01:04:21,331
You weren't properly prepped
because you wouldn't listen to us.

1339
01:04:21,365 --> 01:04:23,465
<i>You never listen</i>
<i>to your advisors.</i>

1340
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,467
Because you're
overwhelming me

1341
01:04:25,502 --> 01:04:27,436
<i>with too much information.</i>

1342
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:29,438
<i>I don't want to do</i>
<i>these interviews.</i>

1343
01:04:29,472 --> 01:04:31,607
I want to do

No presidential campaign has ever
had to deal with this before.

Yes, sir.
She'll be great.

'Cause if it goes like Couric,
I don't think we can recover.

- She keeps bringing it up.
- What the fuck?

1439
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:42,264
I did that stupid fucking
poll a week ago.

she's in the 70s.

01:09:44,034 --> 01:09:45,501
Yeah, well, I don't think
she believes you.

She says you made
those numbers up.

01:09:47,137 --> 01:09:48,905
Okay.

John McCain has that streak

that I think is very, very
important in our leadership today.

<i>I have that</i>
<i>within me also.</i>

Okay? If you don't know

1468
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:20,590
just bring it back to the general
theme of reforming America

1469
01:11:20,624 --> 01:11:23,459

stronger suits, like energy.

about where global warming
comes from defeats--

1479
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:49,483
defeats, you know, the point
that it's getting hotter

1480
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:53,688

very concerned about heat.

- He did.

1510

He said trees
cause pollution.

1511
01:13:43,959 --> 01:13:47,228
And he not only
won the election,

1512
01:13:47,262 --> 01:13:50,298
he went on to be
a great president.

1513

all these facts and figures?

You were so intimidated...

It's just more people.

Steve, what's up?

1582
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,327
How many questions does Sarah Palin
have to answer in the debate?

1583
01:17:55,362 --> 01:17:58,431
22 to 25.

1584
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:00,466
And how long
is each answer?

Two minutes with pivots.

1586
01:18:02,369 --> 01:18:04,136
So if all we have to do

1587
01:18:04,171 --> 01:18:06,939
is get the best actress

to memorize 45 minutes'
worth of answers,

1589
01:18:10,209 --> 01:18:12,377
then why did
we waste five days

what any of this shit means?

Governor, I didn't know
you were going for a jog.

to go running, Steve,

make me feel better.

Can you understand that?

01:18:31,997 --> 01:18:34,030
Of course, Governor.

1598
01:18:47,812 --> 01:18:51,046
I think we need to get rid
of these notecards.

01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:54,516
- They're not helping.
- Okay.

1600

I hate those
flippin' cards anyway.

1601
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:59,855
Now, what we
need you to do

1602
01:18:59,889 --> 01:19:03,892
is to memorize 25 answers
and four attack lines.

1603
01:19:03,927 --> 01:19:06,961
Do you think
you can do that?

1604
01:19:06,996 --> 01:19:08,596
Yeah, I can do that.

Governor Palin,

1612
01:19:44,731 --> 01:19:48,534
nuclear Iran is one
of our gravest threats.

What would a McCain
administration do to stop it?

1614

On the subject
of "nucular" Iran,

1615
01:19:54,506 --> 01:19:57,008

away from extinction.

We don't pass it to our

we have to fight for it
and protect it,

shall do the same.

- Oh. Biden.

- No, I meant "oh," as in "oh, I get it,"

01:21:06,407 --> 01:21:08,008
not "o" as in o'Biden.

01:22:32,022 --> 01:22:33,655
You okay?

1676
01:22:35,224 --> 01:22:37,326
My son is safe.

1677
01:22:38,795 --> 01:22:40,562
My son is safe.

1678
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:54,041
Well, what we are
going to see

1679
01:22:54,075 --> 01:22:56,677
is probably
the most anticipated

1680
01:22:56,712 --> 01:22:58,446
vice presidential debate

1681
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,181
<i>that I have covered ever.</i>

1682
01:23:01,216 --> 01:23:03,584
<i>A lot, a lot of pressure</i>
<i>on Sarah Palin.</i>

1683
01:23:03,618 --> 01:23:05,552
<i>As for Joe Biden,</i>
<i>it's sort of a,</i>

1684
01:23:05,586 --> 01:23:07,887
<i>first of all,</i>
<i>do-no-harm night for him.</i>

1685
01:23:07,921 --> 01:23:11,257
<i>No one has questioned</i>
<i>that he is qualified</i>

1686
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,692
<i>to be vice president.</i>

1687
01:23:12,727 --> 01:23:14,293
<i>He needs to--</i>
<i>both of them,</i>

1688
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:16,262
<i>need to talk about the top</i>
<i>of their tickets.</i>

1689
01:23:16,296 --> 01:23:19,198
- ( Mouths words )
- <i>After all, this isn't</i> <i>a race to be vice president</i>

1690
01:23:19,233 --> 01:23:21,933
<i>so much as it is</i>
<i>to be number two</i>

1691
01:23:21,968 --> 01:23:23,935
<i>to the top people</i>
<i>on the ticket.</i>

1692
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:26,672
<i>On the Joe Biden side,</i>
<i>you will see</i>

1693
01:23:26,706 --> 01:23:29,708
<i>an effort to say,</i>
<i>"look, Sarah Palin..."</i>

1694
01:23:29,743 --> 01:23:32,678
Hurry.

1695
01:23:32,712 --> 01:23:34,546
Pray with me.

1696
01:23:34,581 --> 01:23:36,382
What should we pray for?

1697
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:39,016
Just pray that
we win the debate.

1698
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:41,719
Mom, that would be cheating.

1699
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:48,526
Okay.

1700
01:23:53,631 --> 01:23:55,231
We want to welcome
our viewers

1701
01:23:55,266 --> 01:23:56,867

I'm wolf blitzer,

1703
01:24:00,304 --> 01:24:03,673
We've been waiting for this
night for a long time...

1704
01:24:06,977 --> 01:24:10,345
I did this same walk for
Geraldine ferraro in 1984.

1705
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:11,847
Holy jeez, that's cool.

1706
01:24:11,882 --> 01:24:13,482
This is your toe mark.

1707
01:24:13,517 --> 01:24:15,217
Okay.

1708
01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:18,020
30 seconds.

1709
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:20,456
Two, pull back wide
on her entrance, please.

1710
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:23,826
Ready, two.
And take two.

You can call me Joe.

- No, no, no, it's cool.

Gwen:
<i>Welcome to you both.</i>

1743
01:25:47,205 --> 01:25:49,739
<i>The House of representatives</i>
<i>this week passed a bill,</i>

1744
01:25:49,773 --> 01:25:51,208
<i>a big bail-out bill--</i>

1745
01:25:51,242 --> 01:25:52,742
or didn't pass it,
I should say.

1746
01:25:52,776 --> 01:25:54,511
The senate decided
to pass it

1747
01:25:54,545 --> 01:25:56,413
<i>and the house is wrestling</i>
<i>with it still tonight.</i>

1748
01:25:56,447 --> 01:25:59,782
Was this the worst of Washington

<i>that we saw play out?</i>

1750
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:03,585
Thank you, Gwen, and I thank
the commission also.

1751
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:05,721
I appreciate this privilege

1752
01:26:05,755 --> 01:26:07,223

Please, God, be kind.

1754
01:26:09,559 --> 01:26:11,427
You know, I think
a good barometer here

1755
01:26:11,461 --> 01:26:13,996
when we're trying to figure out
has this been a good time

1756
01:26:14,031 --> 01:26:17,633
or a bad time
in America's economy is...

1757
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:19,901
Go to a kids' soccer game
on Saturday

1758
01:26:19,935 --> 01:26:22,904
and turn to any parent there
on the sideline and ask them,

1759
01:26:22,938 --> 01:26:24,772
"how are you feeling
about the economy?"

1760
01:26:24,806 --> 01:26:26,374

Sarah: <i>...Did we just</i> <i>take a major
hit with</i> <i>those investments?</i>

01:26:36,418 --> 01:26:39,786
There is something to be said
also for man's activities,

1766
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:43,524
but also for the cyclical
temperature changes on our planet.

1767
01:26:43,558 --> 01:26:46,560
Gwen: <i>Senator, what is true</i> <i>and
what is false about</i> <i>the causes?</i>

1768
01:26:46,594 --> 01:26:49,729
If you don't understand
what the cause is,

1769
01:26:49,764 --> 01:26:52,231
it's virtually impossible
to come up with a solution.

The chant is
"drill, baby, drill."

And that's what we hear
all across this country

1772
01:26:58,072 --> 01:27:00,806
in our rallies,
because people are so hungry

1773
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:03,242
<i>for those domestic</i>
<i>sources of energy</i>

1774

01:27:05,312 --> 01:27:06,945
We will end this war.

1776
01:27:06,979 --> 01:27:08,380
For John McCain,

1777
01:27:08,414 --> 01:27:11,550
there is no end in sight
to end this war.

1778
01:27:11,584 --> 01:27:13,851
We will end this war.

- Man: Yes!

1789
01:27:35,107 --> 01:27:37,608

Biegun: <i>We're probably the
only</i> <i>ones that heard it.</i>

1795
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:49,519
It was Ronald Reagan
who said

1796

that freedom is always
just one generation away

1797
01:27:52,423 --> 01:27:53,756
from extinction.

1798
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:57,759
We don't pass it to our
children in the bloodstream.

1799
01:27:57,793 --> 01:28:01,497
We have to fight for it
and protect it,

1800
01:28:01,531 --> 01:28:03,098
and then hand it to them

1801
01:28:03,133 --> 01:28:05,567
so that they
will do the same.

1802
01:28:05,602 --> 01:28:07,603
We will fight for it.

1803
01:28:07,637 --> 01:28:10,138
And there is only

1804
01:28:10,172 --> 01:28:12,440
who has really ever
fought for you,

1805
01:28:12,474 --> 01:28:15,042

John McCain.

01:28:21,015 --> 01:28:22,882
Mark:
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

1808
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:25,152
CBS instant poll

1809
01:28:25,186 --> 01:28:29,122
give the debate
to biden, 46%; Palin, 21.

1810
01:28:29,157 --> 01:28:31,458
Fuck CBS and fuck
their instant poll.

1811
01:28:31,492 --> 01:28:33,092
This is the greatest
debate victory

1812
01:28:33,127 --> 01:28:34,493

- Want one?
- No.

1817
01:28:51,644 --> 01:28:55,446
Senator McCain wanted me
to congratulate you

1818
01:28:55,481 --> 01:28:57,248

1819
01:28:57,283 --> 01:29:00,151

- Thanks.

Tell John I want to bring up
bill ayers and reverend Wright.

1821
01:29:03,889 --> 01:29:06,223
I think it's time
to go for the jugular.

1822
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:09,593
Uh, you'll have to discuss
that with your running mate.

1823
01:29:09,627 --> 01:29:12,962
He made it very clear that he
doesn't want to touch Wright.

1824
01:29:12,997 --> 01:29:15,365
I'll talk to him about it.

1825
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,334
We have to win this thing.

1826
01:29:17,368 --> 01:29:19,803
I so don't want to go
back to Alaska.

1827
01:29:21,271 --> 01:29:23,472
Hmm.

1828
01:29:26,176 --> 01:29:28,578
Stevie.

1829
01:29:28,612 --> 01:29:31,347
You know, I think the worst
of this thing might be over.

1830
01:29:31,381 --> 01:29:32,781
All she's got left
are speeches.

1831
01:29:32,816 --> 01:29:35,384
There's no more debates,
no major interviews.

1832
01:29:35,419 --> 01:29:38,220
Yeah. We're doing great.

1833
01:29:40,789 --> 01:29:44,292
This was an unbelievable win
for Sarah Palin.

1834
01:29:44,327 --> 01:29:48,630
<i>In fact, I think that</i>
<i>it unveiled a level of skill</i>

And she sure is
a breath of fresh air.

1840
01:29:59,374 --> 01:30:00,807

someone from
outside of Washington.

1842
01:30:02,344 --> 01:30:03,910
<i>She sounded like the future.</i>

1843
01:30:03,945 --> 01:30:05,312
Oh, come on, honey.

1844
01:30:05,347 --> 01:30:06,780
Why don't you
get some sleep?

- One sec, okay?
- <i>( Remote clicks )</i>

1846

Man: <i>...Turned around.
</i> <i>I think she has done it</i>

1847
01:30:10,784 --> 01:30:13,720
in the sense that of the
four debaters we've seen,

1848
01:30:13,754 --> 01:30:16,822
she was the most interesting,
attractive of them all.

1849
01:30:16,857 --> 01:30:19,559
- <i>She is personable...</i>
- I can still win this thing.

1850
01:30:19,593 --> 01:30:21,060
<i>...She's got</i>
<i>a sense of humor.</i>

1851
01:30:21,094 --> 01:30:22,562

<i>while Joe's</i>
<i>talking to Gwen...</i>

1853
01:30:28,401 --> 01:30:31,436
This map is now lopsided
in favor of Barack Obama.

1854
01:30:31,471 --> 01:30:33,071
John McCain pulling
out of Michigan.

1855
01:30:33,105 --> 01:30:35,440
The first domino
in an economic debate

1856
01:30:35,475 --> 01:30:37,709
that if John McCain
does not turn around soon,

1857
01:30:37,744 --> 01:30:39,378
many see more blue
on this map

1858
01:30:39,412 --> 01:30:40,979

for John McCain.

1859
01:30:41,013 --> 01:30:42,680
Man: <i>Yesterday, it was</i>
<i>announced that the campaign</i>

1860

<i>is going to leave Michigan</i>
<i>to Obama to win.</i>

1861
01:30:44,516 --> 01:30:46,751
- <i>What's going on there?</i>
- I read that this morning also,

1862
01:30:46,785 --> 01:30:48,218
and I fired off
a quick e-mail

1863
01:30:48,253 --> 01:30:50,187
and I said, "oh, come on!
Do we have to?"

1864
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:51,922
<i>Do we have to</i>
<i>call it there?"</i>

1865
01:30:51,956 --> 01:30:54,792
I want to go back to Michigan,
and I want to try.

1866
01:30:54,826 --> 01:30:56,694
Steve:
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1867
01:30:56,728 --> 01:30:58,461
McCain had hoped to
just score a pick-up.

1868
01:30:58,496 --> 01:31:00,930
We made the decision to pull
the ads out of Michigan

1869
01:31:00,964 --> 01:31:02,399
because we can't win there.

1870
01:31:02,433 --> 01:31:03,800
We need the money
in Pennsylvania

1871
01:31:03,834 --> 01:31:07,103
- <i>and Ohio.</i>
- You're making a big mistake.

<i>You know, I know I'm not</i>
<i>an expert like yourself,</i>

but seeing as we're
seven points out,

1874
01:31:11,809 --> 01:31:13,875
I don't see why
the vice presidential campaign

1875
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:15,411
can't make
a quick stop there

1876
01:31:15,445 --> 01:31:16,812

1880

1883
01:31:29,758 --> 01:31:32,593
You must stick

1884
01:31:32,628 --> 01:31:35,363
And what script
is that, Steve?

1885
01:31:35,397 --> 01:31:36,931

01:31:43,872 --> 01:31:45,372
you hurt John McCain.

Afternoon, governor.

1893

This is a pro-stem cell ad?

1894
01:32:01,155 --> 01:32:03,522
Yes, Governor.
That's the Senator's position.

1895
01:32:03,557 --> 01:32:06,425
Yeah, it's not my position.
I'm not saying it.

1896
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:07,760
I thought that--

1897

you guys should have shown
me the script ahead of time.

1898
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:13,031
This is a waste of my time.

1899

Why wasn't I informed

at the rally?

1901
01:32:19,171 --> 01:32:20,972
I don't think we foresaw
that being a problem.

1902
01:32:21,006 --> 01:32:23,575
I just googled him.
He's pro-choice.

1903
01:32:23,609 --> 01:32:28,546
There's no way I'm going onstage
with anyone who's pro-choice.

Bradley's gone

1905
01:32:31,183 --> 01:32:32,417
Yes, Governor.

on your involvement
in the troopergate scandal?

1932
01:33:30,172 --> 01:33:32,373
I was thrilled to be
cleared of all wrongdoing.

1933
01:33:32,408 --> 01:33:34,042
You know you're not
supposed to be here.

1934
01:33:34,076 --> 01:33:36,710
Go back to the press risers,
please. Thank you.

1935
01:33:36,745 --> 01:33:39,547
You can't say you were
cleared of all wrongdoing.

1936
01:33:39,581 --> 01:33:41,682
- Why not?
- Because you weren't.

1937
01:33:41,716 --> 01:33:44,585
The report stated that
you abused your power.

1938
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,254
That is the opposite of being
cleared of all wrongdoing.

1939
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,690
- Then why was I told otherwise?
- You weren't told otherwise.

1940
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:51,124
And why haven't you
released a statement

1941
01:33:51,159 --> 01:33:52,593
saying that Todd
was never a member

1942
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:53,894
of the Alaska
independence party?

1943
01:33:53,929 --> 01:33:57,229
Because that would be untrue.
He was a member.

1944
01:33:57,264 --> 01:33:59,065
He checked the wrong box.

1945
01:33:59,099 --> 01:34:00,633
He registered by accident,

1946
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:02,669
and rectified the error
immediately.

1947
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:04,504
He was a member
for seven years!

1948
01:34:04,538 --> 01:34:06,940
I'm sorry,
Governor, but...

1949
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:09,008
There is only a few weeks
left in this campaign.

1950
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:11,176
You have got to stop
saying things to the press

1951
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:12,611
that are blatantly untrue.

1952
01:34:12,645 --> 01:34:15,246
That is not the kind of campaign
that we are running here.

1953
01:34:15,281 --> 01:34:18,484
"Campaign"-- is that what
you're calling this now?

1954
01:34:18,518 --> 01:34:21,653
Governor, I admit that this
is a dysfunctional campaign,

1955
01:34:21,688 --> 01:34:23,121
but that is what I inherited,

1956
01:34:23,155 --> 01:34:26,091
and I am doing my level best
to help us win this election.

1957
01:34:26,125 --> 01:34:27,658
And that's what
I'm trying to do, too,

1958
01:34:27,693 --> 01:34:29,259
and all you're doing
is screwing me up.

1959
01:34:29,294 --> 01:34:32,196
That's all you've done this
entire time, is get in my way.

1960
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:34,365
- <i>( Crowd cheering )</i>
- Sarah: <i>Oh, oh.</i>

1961
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:37,334
And I am raising millions of
dollars for this campaign.

1962
01:34:37,369 --> 01:34:39,169
Hundreds of thousands
of people are coming

1963
01:34:39,204 --> 01:34:41,238

McCain, God bless him.

1964
01:34:41,272 --> 01:34:42,639
They are coming to see me.

1965
01:34:42,673 --> 01:34:46,943
So if I am single-handedly
carrying this <i>campaign,</i>

1966
01:34:46,978 --> 01:34:49,178
I'm gonna do what I want.

as possible,

1982
01:35:47,734 --> 01:35:49,468
and the only way
that can happen

1983
01:35:49,502 --> 01:35:51,370
is if you get her in line.

1984
01:35:54,407 --> 01:35:56,542
That's not gonna
do it, Steve.

1985
01:35:56,577 --> 01:35:59,178
She might start
turning on me.

1986
01:36:11,123 --> 01:36:13,424
Most of these polls
have us trailing

1987
01:36:13,459 --> 01:36:15,426
five to eight points.

1988
01:36:15,461 --> 01:36:17,829
- So what now?
- John...

1989
01:36:17,863 --> 01:36:19,863
I mean, these numbers
do show it.

1990
01:36:19,898 --> 01:36:22,532
We've got to make this
about Obama.

1991
01:36:22,567 --> 01:36:24,101
We've got to get tough

1992
01:36:24,135 --> 01:36:26,036
and we've got
to get negative.

1993
01:36:26,071 --> 01:36:28,072
If we go this way,

1994
01:36:28,106 --> 01:36:31,976
reverend Wright is still
the best play we have.

1995
01:36:33,144 --> 01:36:36,045

called her a bastard

2002
01:36:56,365 --> 01:36:59,635
Yeah, listen, South Carolina--
that was an ugly primary,

2003
01:36:59,669 --> 01:37:01,136
but this isn't
the same thing.

2004
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:03,672
<i>I mean, reverend Wright</i>
<i>really did say those things.</i>

2005
01:37:03,706 --> 01:37:06,141
That may be true.

2006
01:37:06,175 --> 01:37:09,710
But there is a dark side
to American populism.

2007
01:37:09,745 --> 01:37:13,014
Some people win elections
by tapping into it.

2008
01:37:14,783 --> 01:37:17,551
I'm not one of those people.

2009
01:37:17,585 --> 01:37:21,922
Rick: <i>Okay.
So what about</i> <i>bill ayers?</i>

2010
01:37:21,957 --> 01:37:23,923
Obama began his career

2011
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:26,159
in the living room
of a domestic terrorist.

2012
01:37:26,193 --> 01:37:29,929
Domestic terrorist.
Nothing to do with race.

2013
01:37:35,169 --> 01:37:37,537
Yeah, okay.

2014
01:37:37,571 --> 01:37:40,005
Ayers is fair.

2015
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,507
Okay. Who ouould do this?

2016
01:37:42,542 --> 01:37:45,177
And Barack held
one of the first meetings

2017
01:37:45,211 --> 01:37:49,247
of his political career
in bill ayers' living room.

2018
01:37:49,282 --> 01:37:51,516
( Crowd protesting )

2019
01:37:51,551 --> 01:37:54,452
Pallin' around
with terrorists.

2020
01:37:54,487 --> 01:37:56,087
( Crowd grumbling )

2021
01:37:56,121 --> 01:37:57,889
Woman:
<i>He n not a Christian!</i>

2022
01:37:57,923 --> 01:38:00,624
And I am just so fearful

2023
01:38:00,659 --> 01:38:02,994
that this is not a man

2024
01:38:03,028 --> 01:38:05,629
who sees America

2025
01:38:05,664 --> 01:38:10,234
- the way that you and I see America--
- Man: <i>He's a socialist!</i>

2026
01:38:10,268 --> 01:38:16,272
As the greatest source
for good in this world.

2027
01:38:19,042 --> 01:38:21,376
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

2028
01:38:21,411 --> 01:38:24,146
Crowd:
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

2029
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:27,049
John: What does Barack
Obama plan for America?

2030
01:38:27,084 --> 01:38:29,251
- ( Crowd shouting )
- Woman: <i>Nothing!</i>

2031
01:38:29,285 --> 01:38:32,788
In short, who is
the real Barack Obama?

2032
01:38:32,823 --> 01:38:35,924
Man:
<i>A terrorist!</i>

2033
01:38:35,958 --> 01:38:37,792
We believe that
the best of America

2034
01:38:37,827 --> 01:38:41,329
is not all in Washington, D.
C. we believe--

2035
01:38:45,267 --> 01:38:48,536
we believe that
the best of America

2036
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:51,571
is in these small towns
that we get to visit

2037
01:38:51,606 --> 01:38:53,974
and in these wonderful
little pockets

2038
01:38:54,008 --> 01:38:56,343
of what I call
the real America.

2039
01:38:56,377 --> 01:38:59,079
- Yes!
- Yeah!

2040
01:38:59,981 --> 01:39:03,516
Crowd:
Sarah! Sarah!

2041
01:39:08,789 --> 01:39:11,124
For a man who's
written two memoirs,

2042
01:39:11,158 --> 01:39:12,625
he's no open book.

2043
01:39:12,659 --> 01:39:15,161
- ( Crowd laughs )
- Woman: <i>You got that right.</i>

2044
01:39:15,195 --> 01:39:17,696
What does Barack Obama
see for America?

2045
01:39:17,731 --> 01:39:19,198
He's a Muslim!

2046
01:39:19,233 --> 01:39:20,733
He's a socialist!

2047
01:39:20,768 --> 01:39:23,135
- He doesn't represent us!
- Man: <i>He doesn't belong here!</i>

2048
01:39:23,169 --> 01:39:25,503
Man #2: <i>He hangs out with people</i>
<i>who hate our country.</i>

2049
01:39:25,537 --> 01:39:28,373
- Woman: <i>He's not American!</i>
- Man #3: <i>Kill him!</i>

2050
01:39:28,407 --> 01:39:31,943
Woman #2:
<i>Send him back to Africa!</i>

2051
01:39:31,978 --> 01:39:33,779
Wolf:
<i>Let me read to you, Tara,</i>

2052
01:39:33,813 --> 01:39:36,681
<i>what congressman John Lewis,</i>
<i>the civil rights icon,</i>

2053
01:39:36,715 --> 01:39:39,183
<i>said on Saturday</i>
<i>in a statement.</i>

2054
01:39:39,217 --> 01:39:41,752
<i>He said, "as one who was</i>
<i>a victim of violence</i>"

2055
01:39:41,787 --> 01:39:44,021
<i>and hate during the height</i>
<i>of the civil rights movement,</i>

2056
01:39:44,055 --> 01:39:46,123
<i>I am deeply disturbed</i>
<i>by the negative tone</i>

2057
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:48,125
<i>of the McCain-Palin</i>
<i>campaign.</i>

2058
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:50,161
<i>Senator McCain</i>
<i>and governor Palin"...</i>

2059
01:39:50,195 --> 01:39:51,996
We gotta tone
the rhetoric down.

2060
01:39:52,030 --> 01:39:53,930
It's gotten out of control.

2061
01:39:53,964 --> 01:39:57,600
We can't even mention
Obama's name any more.

2062
01:39:57,634 --> 01:39:59,635
The crowd gets too hot.

2063
01:40:02,606 --> 01:40:05,708
This isn't the campaign
I wanted to run.

2064
01:40:07,111 --> 01:40:09,378
I can't trust Obama.

2065
01:40:09,413 --> 01:40:11,713
I've read about him,
and he's not a--

2066
01:40:11,747 --> 01:40:14,116
he's a-- he's a arab.

2067
01:40:14,150 --> 01:40:15,717
He's not an amer--

2068
01:40:15,751 --> 01:40:18,120
no, ma'am.

2069
01:40:18,154 --> 01:40:19,554
No, ma'am.

2070
01:40:19,588 --> 01:40:22,624
He's a decent
family-man citizen

2071
01:40:22,658 --> 01:40:24,793
who I just happen to have
disagreements with

2072
01:40:24,828 --> 01:40:27,161
<i>on certain</i>
<i>fundamental issues.</i>

2073
01:40:27,196 --> 01:40:30,298
And that's what this
campaign is all about.

2074
01:40:30,332 --> 01:40:33,067
- ( Applause )
- He's not. Thank you.

2075
01:40:34,369 --> 01:40:35,937
Woman: <i>Cutting through</i>
<i>the bull tonight,</i>

2076
01:40:35,971 --> 01:40:37,471
<i>on the Eve</i>
<i>of the election,</i>

2077
01:40:37,505 --> 01:40:40,174
<i>the campaigns are relying</i>
<i>on their lucky charms.</i>

2078
01:40:40,209 --> 01:40:43,710
- Vodka rocks, lime.
- Bartender: <i>You got it.</i>

2079
01:40:43,744 --> 01:40:45,178
How's he doing?

2080
01:40:45,213 --> 01:40:48,681
He's the most depressed I've
seen him the entire campaign.

2081
01:40:48,716 --> 01:40:51,818
I can't get him
to stop watching msnbc,

2082
01:40:51,853 --> 01:40:54,154
which only makes him
more miserable.

2083
01:40:55,556 --> 01:40:59,325
I'm amazed that someone
who has been in politics

2084
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:02,061
this long takes
all the petty stuff

2085
01:41:02,095 --> 01:41:03,628
so personally.

2086
01:41:03,663 --> 01:41:06,365
And that's why they are
who they are.

2087
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:08,234
Reagan, bush, Clinton--

2088
01:41:08,268 --> 01:41:10,535
all they want
is to be loved.

2089
01:41:10,570 --> 01:41:13,272
The ones that don't
pathologically need to be loved,

2090
01:41:13,306 --> 01:41:14,939
they don't get
the nomination.

2091
01:41:14,974 --> 01:41:16,540
They don't get
to be president.

2092
01:41:16,575 --> 01:41:18,142
If you'd understood
that fact,

2093
01:41:18,177 --> 01:41:21,079
you might have been able to better
handle our Alaskan moose hunter.

2094
01:41:22,647 --> 01:41:25,383
God, it was
a tough campaign.

2095
01:41:25,417 --> 01:41:28,419
It wasn't a campaign,
it was a bad reality show.

2096
01:41:28,453 --> 01:41:30,587
She didn't cost us
the election.

2097
01:41:30,621 --> 01:41:33,556
That was bush.
That was the economy.

2098
01:41:33,591 --> 01:41:35,859
That was just
the cold hand of fate.

2099
01:41:35,894 --> 01:41:37,961
We didn't have a chance.

2100
01:41:37,996 --> 01:41:39,763
And if we did win,

2101
01:41:39,797 --> 01:41:43,466
would you feel comfortable
with president Palin?

2102
01:41:43,501 --> 01:41:45,369
Why not?
Then we would have won.

2103
01:41:47,237 --> 01:41:48,637
Come on, guys, listen.

2104
01:41:48,671 --> 01:41:51,173
I, too, wish that
the American people

2105
01:41:51,208 --> 01:41:53,376
would choose the future
Abraham Lincoln

2106
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:55,778
or Thomas Jefferson,
but unfortunately,

2107
01:41:55,812 --> 01:41:57,579
that's not the way
it works any more.

2108
01:41:57,614 --> 01:42:00,716
Now it takes
movie star charisma

2109
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:02,750
to get elected president.

2110
01:42:02,785 --> 01:42:06,754
And Obama and Palin, that's
what they are-- they're stars.

2111
01:42:06,789 --> 01:42:08,589
Primary difference being

2112
01:42:08,624 --> 01:42:11,626
Sarah Palin can't name
a supreme court decision,

2113
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,861
whereas Barack Obama

2114
01:42:13,896 --> 01:42:15,897
was a constitutional
law Professor.

2115
01:42:15,932 --> 01:42:17,565
Fuck you.

2116
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:24,138
You know what
dick Cheney said

2117
01:42:24,172 --> 01:42:26,540
- when he found out we picked her?
- What?

2118
01:42:26,574 --> 01:42:29,843
He said we made
a reckless choice.

2119
01:42:29,877 --> 01:42:34,247
When you lose the moral
high ground to dick Cheney,

2120
01:42:34,281 --> 01:42:36,950
it's time to re-think
your entire life.

2121
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:38,918
Enough Cheney cracks, okay?

2122
01:42:38,953 --> 01:42:41,321
I mean, he's very
misunderstood.

2123
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:42,822
How does he eat
when he's wearing

2124
01:42:42,856 --> 01:42:44,757
darth vader's
helmet, anyway?

2125
01:42:46,193 --> 01:42:47,593
There we go.

2126
01:42:47,627 --> 01:42:50,128
Gentlemen, let's wish
each other good luck.

2127
01:42:50,163 --> 01:42:52,331
Who knows,
we could have another

2128
01:42:52,365 --> 01:42:54,299
Dewey-Truman
situation here.

2129
01:42:54,334 --> 01:42:56,034
<i>Always room for an upset.</i>

2130
01:42:56,069 --> 01:42:58,937
Yeah, maybe I'll wake up
with a full head of hair.

2131
01:43:02,575 --> 01:43:05,210
You know, if we had just
asked for policy questions

2132
01:43:05,244 --> 01:43:08,145
in the briefing,
then we would have known.

2133
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:10,714
I thought culvahouse was gonna
grill her during the vet.

2134
01:43:10,748 --> 01:43:13,351
Culvahouse thought
we were gonna grill her.

2135
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:17,088
It haunts me.

2136
01:43:20,725 --> 01:43:23,159
Woman:
<i>After a hard-fought battle,</i>

2137
01:43:23,194 --> 01:43:26,129
<i>the nation's longest-running</i>
<i>presidential race</i>

2138
01:43:26,163 --> 01:43:28,731
<i>comes down to this day--</i>
<i>election day.</i>

2139
01:43:28,765 --> 01:43:32,402
Man: <i>Voting is now underway</i>
<i>in all the lower 48 states</i>

2140
01:43:32,436 --> 01:43:34,904
<i>as we approach the end</i>
<i>of this historic election.</i>

2141
01:43:34,938 --> 01:43:37,307
Man #2: <i>People lined up</i>
<i>across the country</i>

2142
01:43:37,341 --> 01:43:39,074
<i>by the millions today.</i>

2143
01:43:39,109 --> 01:43:41,543
Woman #2: <i>Turnout looks to be</i>
<i>the highest in decades.</i>

2144
01:43:41,577 --> 01:43:45,280
John McCain will carry Kentucky
once again, as expected.

2145
01:43:45,315 --> 01:43:48,717
<i>Eight electoral votes,</i>
<i>not a huge surprise.</i>

2146
01:43:48,751 --> 01:43:51,120
We are not able
to make a projection

2147
01:43:51,154 --> 01:43:53,188
- <i>in the four other states...</i>
- <i>( Phone vibrating )</i>

2148
01:43:53,223 --> 01:43:55,490
<i>That are closing</i>
<i>all their polls</i>

01:43:55,524 --> 01:43:57,225
<i>at this hour right now.</i>

2150
01:43:57,259 --> 01:43:59,293
<i>And some of them</i>
<i>are battleground states--</i>

2151
01:43:59,328 --> 01:44:02,630
<i>Georgia, Indiana,</i>
<i>South Carolina and Virginia.</i>

2152
01:44:02,664 --> 01:44:05,799
<i>It doesn't necessarily</i> <i>mean that
it's gonna be</i> <i>close or not...</i>

2153
01:44:05,834 --> 01:44:09,003
- <i>( Elevator dings )</i>
- Where's Virginia?

2154
01:44:09,038 --> 01:44:12,906
Man: <i>Negative five.
</i> <i>And Ohio's gone.</i>

2155
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:14,807
- Got it.
- <i>I'll keep you posted.</i>

2156
01:44:14,842 --> 01:44:16,743
Call you in 10.

2157
01:44:17,811 --> 01:44:19,379
What's going on?

2158
01:44:19,414 --> 01:44:21,915
We're gonna lose
Pennsylvania.

2159
01:44:21,949 --> 01:44:23,983
And Ohio.

2160
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:27,619
Steve...

2161
01:44:27,654 --> 01:44:31,623
There's something
I have to tell you.

2162
01:44:31,658 --> 01:44:34,626
What's wrong?

2163
01:44:34,661 --> 01:44:36,695
I didn't vote.

2164
01:44:36,729 --> 01:44:39,198
I couldn't do it.

2165
01:44:39,232 --> 01:44:41,833
I didn't vote.

2166
01:44:44,770 --> 01:44:46,237
I couldn't do it.

2167
01:44:46,272 --> 01:44:48,239
It's okay.

2168
01:44:48,274 --> 01:44:49,874
- Wolf: <i>Soledad.</i>
- Woman: <i>All right, wolf,</i>

2169
01:44:49,908 --> 01:44:51,976
<i>we'll take you right to</i>
<i>the voter analysis...</i>

2170
01:44:53,879 --> 01:44:56,013
How we doing,
Stevie boy?

2171
01:44:59,417 --> 01:45:02,419
We lost Pennsylvania
and Ohio, sir.

2172
01:45:17,301 --> 01:45:19,402
( Sighs )

2173
01:45:20,971 --> 01:45:23,806
When my grandfather

2174
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:28,677
found out that the Japanese
had surrendered,

2175
01:45:28,712 --> 01:45:30,479
he was lost.

2176
01:45:30,513 --> 01:45:33,881
He didn't know
what to do with himself.

2177
01:45:33,916 --> 01:45:36,551
He came home,

2178
01:45:36,586 --> 01:45:39,020
dropped dead
the very next day.

2179
01:45:41,757 --> 01:45:45,494
Fought his war,
then he died.

2180
01:45:47,028 --> 01:45:48,729
And my dad,

2181
01:45:48,763 --> 01:45:52,466
when he retired
from the Navy,

2182
01:45:52,501 --> 01:45:55,035
he fell into
a sense of despair

2183
01:45:55,069 --> 01:45:57,371
for the rest of his life.

2184
01:46:04,178 --> 01:46:06,779
I'm never gonna quit, Steve.

2185
01:46:08,215 --> 01:46:09,882
I can't.

2186
01:46:13,354 --> 01:46:15,288
I don't know how
to just fade away.

2187
01:46:18,858 --> 01:46:20,825
Senator, I--

2188
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:22,861
I just want to say--

2189
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,168
<i>( sighs )</i>

2190
01:46:29,202 --> 01:46:31,136
What?

2191
01:46:33,506 --> 01:46:35,939
I'm s-- I'm s--

2192
01:46:35,974 --> 01:46:38,309
I'm so sorry that I...

2193
01:46:39,278 --> 01:46:41,945
Suggested her.

2194
01:46:44,349 --> 01:46:46,050
Don't be.

2195
01:46:47,519 --> 01:46:49,220
Fuck 'Em.

2196
01:46:50,788 --> 01:46:53,623
What were
we supposed to do?

2197
01:46:53,658 --> 01:46:56,593
- <i>( Music playing )</i>
- A truly historic night here in the United States.

2198
01:46:56,627 --> 01:46:57,994
Barack Obama will become

2199
01:46:58,028 --> 01:47:00,197
<i>the 44th president</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

2200
01:47:00,231 --> 01:47:02,165
Piper:
Sorry, mom.

2201
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,000
Oh, thanks, kiddo.

2202
01:47:04,034 --> 01:47:06,768
I'm really sorry, mom.

2203
01:47:06,803 --> 01:47:08,537
Sweetheart.

2204
01:47:08,572 --> 01:47:11,006
You did great.
You know that, right?

2205
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,508
- Yeah.
- Okay?

2206
01:47:12,542 --> 01:47:14,310
Come here, baby.

2207
01:47:14,344 --> 01:47:17,779
- It's all right. We're okay. Yeah.
- Todd: Yeah.

2208
01:47:20,016 --> 01:47:23,117
I'll take the stress
very literally here.

2209
01:47:23,151 --> 01:47:25,286
- Just one quick-- you think?
- <i>( Knocking )</i>

2210
01:47:25,321 --> 01:47:28,223
And on this next part, would
you make sure you bold that?

2211
01:47:28,257 --> 01:47:31,392
Oh, Chris, I need you to load
this in the teleprompter for me.

2212
01:47:31,427 --> 01:47:33,194
Steve schmidt told me
you weren't making a speech.

2213
01:47:33,229 --> 01:47:36,964
No. I am making a speech.

2214
01:47:36,998 --> 01:47:38,532
Scully cleared it
with Rick Davis.

2215
01:47:38,566 --> 01:47:40,367
So just go ahead
and load it, okay?

2216
01:47:40,401 --> 01:47:42,336
Okay.

2217
01:47:45,172 --> 01:47:49,543
Okay, so, on the stress
on this one, I'll take it.

2218
01:47:49,577 --> 01:47:51,712
- Jesus!
- Hey, sorry.

2219
01:47:51,746 --> 01:47:53,813
Steve, I'm getting a bunch
of mixed messages here.

2220
01:47:53,848 --> 01:47:55,848
Is the governor giving
a concession speech or not--

2221
01:47:55,882 --> 01:47:58,517
I've already sd d this
five times already.

2222
01:47:58,552 --> 01:48:00,319
She is not giving a speech.

2223
01:48:00,354 --> 01:48:01,887
Well, she seems
to think otherwise.

2224
01:48:01,921 --> 01:48:03,922
Well, she's not.

2225
01:48:03,957 --> 01:48:05,558
What do you want me
to tell her?

2226
01:48:05,592 --> 01:48:08,327
Tell her she's not
fucking speaking!

2227
01:48:08,362 --> 01:48:10,062
Okay, well, you both
seem pretty certain--

2228
01:48:10,096 --> 01:48:12,830
well, let my certainty
supersede her certainty.

2229
01:48:12,865 --> 01:48:14,366
God damn it!

2230
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,301
( Indistinct chatter )

2231
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:20,371
Steve.

2232
01:48:20,405 --> 01:48:22,373
You want to see me?

2233
01:48:22,407 --> 01:48:24,241
Yes. This way.

2234
01:48:32,116 --> 01:48:34,284
Steve:
<i>Excuse us a moment.</i>

2235
01:48:41,659 --> 01:48:44,827
I understand you've prepared a speech.
Is that correct?

2236
01:48:44,861 --> 01:48:47,062
Yes, I have.
I want to salute John

2237
01:48:47,097 --> 01:48:49,064
for everything he's done
for this country.

2238
01:48:49,099 --> 01:48:52,901
It's not going to happen.
You're not giving a speech.

2239
01:48:52,935 --> 01:48:54,670
And why is that, Steve?

2240
01:48:54,704 --> 01:48:56,104
You're not giving a speech

2241
01:48:56,138 --> 01:48:58,072
because the vice
presidential candidate

2242
01:48:58,107 --> 01:49:02,010
has never given a concession
speech on election night.

2243
01:49:02,044 --> 01:49:03,912
It's not about you.

2244
01:49:03,946 --> 01:49:06,281
It's about the country.

2245
01:49:06,315 --> 01:49:09,216
Yeah, well, there's a lot of
things never been done before.

2246
01:49:11,252 --> 01:49:12,886
Governor...

2247
01:49:12,921 --> 01:49:14,722
This country
has just elected

2248
01:49:14,756 --> 01:49:17,224
the first African-
American president

2249
01:49:17,258 --> 01:49:19,159
in the history
of its existence.

2250
01:49:19,194 --> 01:49:21,094
And it is
the concession speech

2251
01:49:21,129 --> 01:49:22,862
that will legitimize
his succession

2252
01:49:22,896 --> 01:49:24,997
as commander in chief.

2253
01:49:25,032 --> 01:49:27,500
It is a serious
and solemn occasion,

2254
01:49:27,535 --> 01:49:29,969
and John McCain,
and only John McCain,

2255
01:49:30,003 --> 01:49:33,039
will be giving
this sacred speech.

2256
01:49:33,073 --> 01:49:34,541
This is how
it has been done

2257
01:49:34,575 --> 01:49:36,509
in every
presidential election

2258
01:49:36,544 --> 01:49:38,344
since the dawn
of the Republic,

2259
01:49:38,378 --> 01:49:40,178
and you, Sarah Palin,

2260
01:49:40,213 --> 01:49:42,113
will not change
the importance

2261
01:49:42,148 --> 01:49:46,151
of this proud
American tradition.

2262
01:49:57,896 --> 01:50:01,566
"We fought-- we fought
as hard as we could."

2263
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:03,200
And though we feel short,

2264
01:50:03,235 --> 01:50:05,470
"the fail--
the failure is mine."

2265
01:50:05,504 --> 01:50:07,605
- ( Laughter )
- Oh, jeez, no--

2266
01:50:07,639 --> 01:50:09,340
John: <i>I don't feel</i>
<i>that short, mark.</i>

2267
01:50:09,375 --> 01:50:11,541
- <i>( Door opens )</i>
- "Fell short," boss.

2268
01:50:11,576 --> 01:50:14,043
- Yeah, thanks.
- <i>"Fell short."</i> <i>It's a typo.</i>

2269
01:50:14,078 --> 01:50:17,947
- John.
- Hi, Sarah.

2270
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:22,786
Well, we fought
the good fight.

2271
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:25,422
Mm-hmm, we did.

2272
01:50:25,456 --> 01:50:28,791
Now I'm just gonna get out
there and thank America.

2273
01:50:28,825 --> 01:50:31,293
I can't wait to get
out there and thank you.

2274
01:50:31,327 --> 01:50:35,230
I have a speech written
that is a real tribute to ya.

2275
01:50:35,265 --> 01:50:39,167
No, I think these guys
have that covered.

2276
01:50:39,202 --> 01:50:40,503
Right, Steve?

2277
01:50:40,537 --> 01:50:42,037
Yes, sir.
We have it covered.

2278
01:50:42,071 --> 01:50:45,139
I just wanted people to know
what a great man you are.

2279
01:50:45,173 --> 01:50:46,775
I appreciate that,

2280
01:50:46,809 --> 01:50:49,110
<i>but these guys got it</i>
<i>all worked out.</i>

2281
01:50:49,144 --> 01:50:53,114
Yeah, you know, we probably
should get going now, sir, so...

2282
01:50:53,148 --> 01:50:54,816
All right. Good.

2283
01:50:57,119 --> 01:51:00,421
- Okay. We'll see you afterwards.
- I'll see you out there.

2284
01:51:12,133 --> 01:51:15,835
You're one of the leaders
of the party now, Sarah.

2285
01:51:15,869 --> 01:51:20,239
Don't get co-opted by limbaugh
and the other extremists.

2286
01:51:20,273 --> 01:51:23,375
They'll destroy the party
if you let them.

2287
01:51:24,411 --> 01:51:26,612
Remember,
you're a hockey mom.

2288
01:51:26,647 --> 01:51:28,748
You just wanted
to make a difference,

2289
01:51:28,782 --> 01:51:30,715
and you did.

2290
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:32,116
A big, huge difference.

2291
01:51:32,151 --> 01:51:34,619
<i>I'll always be grateful.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

2292
01:51:34,654 --> 01:51:36,755
- We should go, sir.
- Thank you, John.

2293
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:51,469
My friends, we have--

2294
01:51:51,503 --> 01:51:53,771
we have come to the end
of a long journey.

2295

( Crowd moaning )

2296
01:51:56,174 --> 01:51:58,943
The American people
have spoken,

2297
01:51:58,977 --> 01:52:01,311
and they have
spoken clearly.

2298
01:52:01,346 --> 01:52:03,212
<i>A little while ago,</i>
<i>I had the honor</i>

2299
01:52:03,246 --> 01:52:05,348
of calling
Senator Barack Obama...

01:52:05,382 --> 01:52:07,416
- ( Crowd booing )
- ...To congrat--

2301

please.

2302
01:52:09,587 --> 01:52:11,488
To congratulate him
on being elected

2303
01:52:11,522 --> 01:52:13,923
the next president
of the country we both love.

2304
01:52:13,958 --> 01:52:17,093
( Crowd groaning )

2305
01:52:18,362 --> 01:52:21,563
John:
Whatever our differences,

2306
01:52:21,598 --> 01:52:23,732
we are fellow Americans.

2307
01:52:23,766 --> 01:52:26,768
- ( Crowd cheers )
- Man: Yes, sir!

2308
01:52:26,803 --> 01:52:29,638
John: <i>I am so deeply
grateful</i> <i>to all of you</i>

2309

<i>for the great honor</i>

2310
01:52:31,708 --> 01:52:33,609
and all you have
done for me.

2311
01:52:36,012 --> 01:52:37,778
I am also, of course,

2312
01:52:37,813 --> 01:52:40,615
very thankful to
Governor Sarah Palin,

2313
01:52:40,649 --> 01:52:43,385
one of the best campaigners
I have ever seen.

2314

<i>( Crowd cheering )</i>

2315
01:52:47,390 --> 01:52:50,125
Still think
she's fit for office?

2316
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:51,358
Eh, who cares?

2317
01:52:51,393 --> 01:52:53,593
In 48 hours, no one will
even remember who she is.

2318
01:52:53,628 --> 01:52:56,030
John: <i>We can all look forward</i>
<i>with great interest</i>

2319
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:58,065
<i>to her future service</i>
<i>to Alaska,</i>

2320
01:52:58,099 --> 01:53:01,535
the republican party
and our country.

2321

<i>Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!</i>

01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:29,361
<i>( Stopwatch ticking )</i>

2324
01:53:29,395 --> 01:53:32,964
There were numerous instances
of her saying things

2325
01:53:32,998 --> 01:53:34,433
that were not accurate

2326
01:53:34,467 --> 01:53:36,301
that opened the door
to criticism

2327
01:53:36,335 --> 01:53:39,470
that she was being
untruthful and inaccurate.

2328
01:53:39,504 --> 01:53:43,574
And I think that is something
that continues to this day.

2329
01:53:43,608 --> 01:53:45,142
And you think
that's fair criticism?

2330
01:53:45,177 --> 01:53:46,877
I think that's
fair criticism.

2331
01:53:46,911 --> 01:53:48,612
Early on, though,
you apparently said

2332
01:53:48,646 --> 01:53:50,114
she doesn't know anything.

2333
01:53:50,148 --> 01:53:52,950
In the immediate aftermath
of her selection,

2334
01:53:52,984 --> 01:53:56,652
it was clear to us
that we...

2335
01:53:56,687 --> 01:53:58,555
Had a lot of work to do.

2336
01:53:58,589 --> 01:54:01,558
<i>For you, picking Sarah Palin</i>
<i>was about winning an election,</i>

2337
01:54:01,592 --> 01:54:05,161
not necessarily about who's gonna
be best as vice president.

2338
01:54:05,196 --> 01:54:09,065
My job is to give
