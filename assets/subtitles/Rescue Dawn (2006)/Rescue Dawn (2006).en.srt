1
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,113
Attention.

2
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,703
At ease, gentlemen. Be seated, please.

3
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,877
As you've all probably noticed,
we're currently headed north.

4
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,298
Tomorrow morning at 05:00 hours, we will
be taking a position at Yankee Station.

5
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,551
That means we're back in business.

6
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:43,430
We'll be flying sorties over North Vietnam
to take out enemy supply lines,

7
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,725
which means we have to 
cross over into Laos.

8
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,437
This mission is classified.

9
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,692
No cards and letters to sweethearts.
No phone calls to family back home.

10
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,695
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

11
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,530
No one can know.

12
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,367
No one except Charlie
when we kick his ass.

13
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,162
<i>For survival
in the jungle environment,</i>

14
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:12,542
<i>the smart soldier must understand
that nature is not a force against him.</i>

15
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,128
<i>He has to make nature work for him</i>

16
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:19,633
<i>by utilizing the ample natural provisions
at his disposal.</i>

17
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,718
Is this a double feature?

18
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,556
For God's sake, just lean your 
head back and open your mouth.

19
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,100
What is this?

20
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,354
Hell, the boys back home
don't know anything about the jungle.

21
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,274
<i>In the jungle,
your best friend is your knife.</i>

22
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,068
Oh, look at ... 
Now he's getting serious.

23
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:43,532
Cut the leaf, man. Here it goes.
Come on, baby, cut. Cut.

24
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,371
Where is the salt and pepper 
shaker for that leaf?

25
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,415
Chew it, boy! Chew it!

26
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,877
Leaf good. Me like leaf.

27
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,464
<i>Maintain a constant state
of readiness ... </i>

28
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,426
What did he do, sit in an anthill?
Look at him.

29
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,390
<i>And then, when
the rescue helicopter appears, make sure ... </i>

30
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,476
Honestly, it's right above your head!

31
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,314
Jeez. Shake it, Pops.

32
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,776
He's got a nice ass for a sailor,
I'll tell you that.

33
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,281
I don't mean that in a weird way.

34
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,159
God bless America.

35
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,911
<i>Are you a smart soldier?</i>

36
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,666
I mean, I just thought we'd be assisting
some South Vietnamese generals

37
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,711
against a few infiltrators. Whole thing
would be done in three, four weeks.

38
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,795
You picked the wrong time

39
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
- to enlist, Dengler.
- I know.

40
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,757
No, but I just wanted to fly so badly,

41
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,261
and everybody, they were telling me
all about the fantastic massage parlors

42
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,430
and the go-go girls, everything, and ... 

43
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,974
And what did I get? Goddamn one night?

44
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,852
- One night in Saigon. That's me.
- Yeah, and that didn't go so well.

45
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,812
Gentlemen, next please.

46
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,774
Okay.

47
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,234
Hey, are there any mosquito nets?

48
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,819
What you see is what you get.

49
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,781
- Okay. Okay. I see plastic.
- Yes, sir.

50
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,492
I see plastic there and how about ... 

51
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,870
Are you able to give me two slices
of that plastic, please?

52
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,081
- Sir?
- And maybe six foot by three foot,

53
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,332
you put a zipper in the middle,

54
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,458
- and I crawl inside ... 
- What you're describing

55
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,542
is a sauna, not a mosquito net.

56
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,211
Not a mosquito net,
but it holds off the bugs.

57
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,630
And you put some netting on it
so I can breathe through at night time.

58
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,881
- You got it, sir.
- Yes?

59
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,466
- Absolutely, sir.
- Okay.

60
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,886
Now, look here. Look at this.
I have my boot on your table.

61
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,680
- Why do I have my boot on your table?
- I don't know, sir.

62
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,141
Okay, this is why. Look at this.

63
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,479
Can you create a flap for me
in the tongue here

64
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,899
so I could hide my American passport
inside of here should I need it?

65
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:44,569
You know what, sir? Since you're my only
customer today, it would be my pleasure.

66
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,029
Thank you.

67
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,700
So, Charlie got his shit together.

68
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:54,704
Now we have heavy antiaircraft fire
around Mugia Pass.

69
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,458
Change direction and altitude
every seven seconds

70
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,129
so the radar of the enemy gun
cannot lock onto you.

71
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:07,092
Your secondary target will be
the intersection of 121 and 90.

72
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,260
That's the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

73
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,762
That's right, Spook, inside Laos.

74
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,305
Now, one more thing.

75
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,269
They've been using your radios to 
lure our rescue teams into ambush.

76
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,231
Now, don't get me wrong.
You go down, you use that radio.

77
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,109
But if they're hot on your trail,
you scrap it.

78
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,362
You scrap anything
that they can use against you.

79
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,451
Now, this is Flight Lieutenant 
Dengler's first mission.

80
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,827
Yes, sir.

81
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,956
You're gonna be Spook's wingman. 
You think you can handle that?

82
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,750
I could not ask for a better man, sir.
But, please,

83
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,961
- could I ask you a question, sir?
- Go ahead.

84
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,255
You know, Spook is such
a goddamn daredevil,

85
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,926
could you please order him not to
try too hard to die for his country,

86
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:54,431
but rather to let the son-of-a-bitch
on the other side die for his instead?

87
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,142
Okay. All right, boys.

88
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,644
- You all set?
- Yes, sir.

89
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,812
Anything else?

90
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,105
- No, sir.
- Okay. Let's go, go, go!

91
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:08,820
Raider Tivo, 6195, position four.

92
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,075
Raider Yankee, 67279, position two.

93
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,828
- Heads against the wall. Come on.
- Come on, Diet.

94
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,705
Come here.
This is what we would do as kids

95
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,124
when we were out for mischief.
It would keep us out of trouble.

96
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,418
But we would usually pee right now.

97
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,337
- Can we pee?
- I don't really have to.

98
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,796
I'm not gonna.

99
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,925
But this will keep us safe. Okay, fellas?

100
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,178
Stay out of trouble.
Come back in one piece. Good luck.

101
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,263
- Come back, boys.
- You, too.

102
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:18,056
Boys, get set to change
the altitude again. On my mark.

103
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,933
- Now.
- Roger.

104
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,105
Gentlemen, do you notice
the coastline down there?

105
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,024
Welcome to North Vietnam.

106
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,028
It's pretty boring.

107
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,741
Boys, we got too much cloud cover.

108
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,995
Climbing again 280 west.
We're heading into Laos.

109
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,875
Target in sight.

110
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,087
Lessard, roll in.

111
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,463
Rolling.

112
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,514
Farkas, roll in.

113
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,182
Rolling.

114
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,689
Dengler, roll in.

115
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,190
Rolling in.

116
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,836
I'm hit. I'm hit!

117
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,341
Dieter, you're losing altitude!
Pull it up!

118
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,052
Dieter, pull up!

119
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,394
Dengler, get out of there!

120
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:52,817
Dieter, bail out!

121
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,781
I'm not gonna bail out!

122
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,665
Oh, come on.

123
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,252
Come on.

124
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,426
Come on, search planes.

125
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,263
Where are you? Where have you gone?

126
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,189
Come on.

127
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,408
God, how can it get this hot?

128
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,923
Hey. Hey.
I need to go to the bathroom.

129
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,134
I need ... 

130
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,888
I need to go to the bathroom.

131
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,184
Yeah. I need to take a shit.

132
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,440
Hey. Hey.

133
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,651
I need to take a shit.

134
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,123
Oh, shit.

135
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,876
Hey. Hey.

136
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,380
Does nobody listen to me?

137
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,762
Why doesn't anybody listen around here?

138
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:24,889
Why don't you listen to me?

139
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,643
I said I needed the bathroom
and now I've shit myself.

140
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,687
Why doesn't anybody listen around here?

141
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,522
I'll shit my pants.

142
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,747
They can't hear us.
They can't see us through the treetops.

143
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,626
It's not my fault. I didn't signal them.

144
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,266
Don't ever, ever do that again!

145
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,437
You better just shoot me right away!
Don't you ever do that again!

146
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,223
This is unusual.

147
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,227
You American pilots normally attack us
earlier in the day. Sit.

148
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,858
No English.

149
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,611
German.

150
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,039
Why don't you admit
that you are an American?

151
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,508
Yes.

152
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,303
I am an American citizen,

153
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,139
and I love my country.

154
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,685
But why are you in this war against us?

155
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,062
I never wanted to go to war.
I never wanted to go to ... 

156
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:09,358
I saw enough as a child.
I only wanted to fly.

157
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,823
Then you should sign this.

158
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,242
"Condemning the imperialistic aggression

159
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:22,204
"of the corrupt and debased political
establishment of the United States ... "

160
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,831
What else would you call it?

161
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,542
" ... against innocent children
and the peace loving working classes."

162
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,420
No, I cannot sign this. I cannot sign it.

163
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,464
If you sign this, we would be your friends.

164
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:37,136
- You could be released in two weeks if ... 
- I cannot sign this.

165
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,431
- It's against my ... 
- Your what?

166
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,058
I mean, what is in here?

167
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,852
What isn't here?

168
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:49,481
I love America. America gave me wings.
I will not sign it, absolutely not.

169
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,900
No way.

170
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,697
Your choice.

171
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,980
The quick have their sleepwalkers,

172
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,026
and so do the dead.

173
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,601
Hey.

174
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,812
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey, there. Who's that? Hello.

175
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,314
Hey, you American?

176
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,107
- What?
- He's American.

177
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,820
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

178
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,614
Yeah, I'm American.

179
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:36,495
My name is Dieter. I'm a U.S. Navy pilot.
And originally I was born in Germany ... 

180
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,705
- Be quiet.
 ... but I am a U.S. citizen now.

181
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,415
- Quiet.
- What?

182
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,000
- Who's that?
- Quiet.

183
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,127
Why? I'm whispering.

184
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,713
- Little Hitler's coming.
- Who?

185
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,924
- Little Hitler.
- Who's that?

186
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,719
Who's Little Hitler?

187
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,610
Okay.

188
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,459
Now, what the hell is this?
The Middle Ages?

189
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:33,552
Hey, listen. Don't mess with
these guys. You'll regret it.

190
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,362
- Hi. Dieter Dengler.
- All right, let's go. Give it over.

191
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,698
Who won the World Series?

192
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,241
- The World Series?
- Yeah.

193
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,285
- I don't know ... 
- Hey, man, the guy don't like baseball?

194
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,411
You don't like baseball?

195
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,664
- No, I don't know. I don't follow baseball.
- I'm Yik Chiu Tuo.

196
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,915
- Yik Chiu Tuo?
- They call me Y.C.

197
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,751
- Okay, Y.C.
- Y.C.

198
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,085
Hi, I'm Dieter Dengler.

199
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,046
- Dieter Dengler.
- Yeah.

200
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,132
We all flew together for Air America.

201
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:16,678
Yeah, I'm world champion of bad luck.
But I tell you something, I'm undefeatable.

202
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,307
Hi. Phisit.

203
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,683
- Phisit.
- My name is Phisit.

204
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,769
- Dieter. Dieter.
- Yeah.

205
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,645
Procet Kam Phong Kit.

206
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,064
- What?
- Procet.

207
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,024
- Okay.
- Procet.

208
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,442
What was that?

209
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,526
- Procet.
- It's okay.

210
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,611
Okay.

211
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:36,740
- That was actually Procet ... Got that?
- Right.

212
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,159
- But you need to call him Procet.
- Okay, Procet.

213
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,452
That's what we call him.

214
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,536
He's also Air America.

215
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,830
- also got shot down flying supplies ... 
- Okay, okay.

216
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,998
 ... to royalist villages,

217
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,250
- just like the rest of us.
- And when was that?

218
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,045
Two ... No, two and a half year ago now.

219
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,465
- Two and a half years ago?
- Oh, yeah.

220
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,718
I had no idea that we were here
for that long.

221
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,430
Yeah, been here a lot longer
than people know.

222
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,724
- Duane Martin.
- Duane Martin. I'm Dieter Dengler.

223
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,936
United States Air Force. I was shot down
about a year and a half ago.

224
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,771
- Okay.
- And when this war starts,

225
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,107
we'll be here a lot longer
than we already have.

226
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,025
Well, you see ... 

227
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:17,614
How many more times you think
I'm gonna have to say,

228
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:22,494
like I been saying and saying and saying
and saying again,

229
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:25,664
that we will never go to war
in Vietnam, man?

230
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,040
- No, they just ... 
- They, no ... 

231
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,876
Because any day now ... Listen.
They will what?

232
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,920
- Yeah, Christmas come every day.
- They ... 

233
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,046
They will release us, man.

234
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,634
They will let us go any day now.

235
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,636
- No, you see ... 
- Gene, by the way.

236
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,429
- Gene.
- But listen.

237
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:45,225
It's ... The trick to it is it's actually Eugene.

238
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,478
- Okay, Eugene.
- Eugene DeBruin from

239
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,106
- Eugene, Oregon.
- Okay.

240
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,150
- How do you like that?
- Yeah.

241
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,735
See how that works out? Name, name ... 

242
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,988
Jesus Christ, not this Oregon shit, again.

243
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,824
I've heard this over 2,000 goddamn times.

244
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,160
- Eugene from Eugene.
- Oh, yeah, right. Eugene from Eugene.

245
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,661
- You know what? You know what? Listen.
- Yeah.

246
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:08,623
What you really need to know is
you see this man here?

247
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,917
Take a good look at him. He, he ... 

248
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:17,424
Listen now, he shits in his pants
every night without fail, man.

249
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,758
Trust me.

250
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,387
And you know the only thing that he
thinks is worth complaining about?

251
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,431
You know what that is?

252
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,683
- This man right here.
- Right.

253
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,102
- Eugene from Eugene.
- From Eugene.

254
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,687
Okay.

255
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,902
Dieter.

256
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,779
Take a careful look to your right.
You see that guy there?

257
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,866
We call him Little Hitler
for a very good reason.

258
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,534
He is the worst.

259
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,621
This one we call Jumbo.

260
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,331
Oh, wow.

261
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,208
That's the first smile I've seen
since I was shot down.

262
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,002
Yeah. He's, in fact,
one of the only truly nice guys here.

263
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:58,798
This is Nook the Rook right here.
He's also very much not a nice guy.

264
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,554
- What is his problem?
- It's all right. Just keep going.

265
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,265
His problem is he's Crazy Horse.
That's what we call him.

266
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,978
And he is a bastard. Keep going.
And I just cannot stand him.

267
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,356
- That's Walkie Talkie.
- Walkie Talkie?

268
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,068
We call him that 'cause he does not speak.
Never, never.

269
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,697
Hey, do yourself a favor, Kraut.

270
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,282
Keep your head down
and your mouth shut.

271
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,993
That's your best chance of surviving.

272
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,808
So there is a war.

273
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,855
There is a war.

274
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,038
All right. So tell me about
the peace talks, man. Geneva?

275
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,582
There's got to be peace talks, man.

276
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,585
Shut up, Gene.
There is no goddamn conference.

277
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,795
When are you gonna get that
through your skull?

278
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,673
Secret talks, man.
I'm just talking about secret talks.

279
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,091
Forget it.

280
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,467
We're not getting out.

281
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,761
No, no, no, there was a honcho
on the outside,

282
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,014
he said I would not be here too long.

283
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,932
They tell that to everyone
to get them to sign.

284
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,768
No, I did not sign. No.

285
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,941
Anyway, nice having met you.

286
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,319
What do you mean, met?

287
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,947
Well, my friends,
you can rot in here if you like,

288
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,118
but I'm gonna scram this very night.

289
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,580
This hut, it ain't no prison.

290
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,627
Scram. I like that. I like that.

291
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:03,673
Listen, listen, my friend,
you cannot escape.

292
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:07,177
If you try to escape,
you'll screw up our release.

293
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:11,848
Look, I don't give a shit about our release
or whatever you think is gonna happen.

294
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:17,187
But without water, you won't survive
more than two days out there.

295
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:21,107
And without water,
your tracks will be visible for even more.

296
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,195
The jungle is the prison. Don't you get it?

297
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:32,118
Hey, when does the rainy season start?

298
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,120
Five months, maybe six.

299
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,123
I can't wait that long.

300
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:42,379
Hey, listen, let's say you do survive
the jungle and lack of water,

301
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:46,383
whatever you find, snakes and animals
and shit are out there,

302
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,385
you won't make it out of camp.

303
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,221
There's six guards posted during the day.

304
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,682
Yeah.

305
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,268
That is during the day.

306
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,939
I'm going at night.

307
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,491
Why, what happens at night?

308
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:17,163
No.

309
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,086
I'm shitting my intestines out.

310
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,132
Again.

311
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,342
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

312
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:34,722
You just shit right on my hand again, man.

313
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:39,769
- Sorry.
- That makes it 2,207 times and counting.

314
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,604
Leave the guy alone, okay?

315
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,940
There ain't no alone, brother.

316
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,484
Does anybody have a nail?

317
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,361
What are you gonna do with a nail?

318
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,281
You're gonna stab all the lousy guards
to death with a nail?

319
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,783
What kind of plane you fly off of?

320
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,495
- Procet has got a shard of glass, man.
- No, that's no good.

321
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,788
I have porcupine needle.

322
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,165
No.

323
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,627
I've got a hammer and a socket wrench
stuffed up my ass.

324
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,466
There's no nails.

325
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,801
This whole prison's made
of bamboo and rattan.

326
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,136
Damn it.

327
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,184
I know where there's a nail.

328
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,948
Okay.

329
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,118
I'm gonna make my move.

330
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,080
So all of you scatter in
all directions, okay? Go.

331
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,373
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

332
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:47,253
What makes you think you're not crazy
for thinking that'll work, man?

333
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,756
Eugene's right.
It'll attract too much attention.

334
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:53,176
Oh, for God's sake, that's what I want.

335
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,594
Please.

336
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,680
You trust me? Please.

337
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,975
Duane, head to the outhouse.

338
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,478
Y.C., go to the top right. Okay?

339
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:06,272
Gene, please come on. No, no, no.

340
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:10,735
Gene, Phisit, Procet,
head towards the gate.

341
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,779
Move as fast as you can.

342
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:17,116
Get their attention, that's what I need.
Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

343
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,716
Hey, Jumbo, Jumbo. Hey, no, no, no.

344
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:38,304
Can I borrow some of the toothpaste?
Let me get some of that. That's good.

345
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,642
I felt so like having a good smile,
you know?

346
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,978
Like you have. You got a good smile, too.

347
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,147
Okay.

348
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,032
Y.C., when I hit it, you make a noise.

349
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,826
Cough or something.

350
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:36,863
I love it.

351
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:41,034
I love it. I love it.

352
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,566
Give me some slack.

353
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,818
Let's see.

354
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,405
Oh, God. Oh, God, that was an easy one.

355
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:28,373
You see, I apprenticed as a tool
and die maker in Germany.

356
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:35,963
There was no aviation at the time
and I wanted to learn something useful

357
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,840
that would help me repair planes.

358
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:42,720
And, boy, are those years coming in handy
in unexpected ways now.

359
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,223
There's only one brand
that I cannot handle,

360
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,808
that is Smith and Wesson.

361
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:56,901
I think with practice, I can open these up
in maybe two, three seconds flat.

362
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:06,327
But listen, everybody keep one cuff
on a wrist at all times,

363
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:11,249
so that if the guards come checking,
we can put them on again quickly.

364
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,627
No, they don't check us at night.
They think we can't get out of these.

365
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,629
They think it's impossible.

366
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,840
Show me how you did that.

367
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,969
It's so simple. Okay.

368
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,889
All you do, insert the nail.

369
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:30,560
There's a cuff and a spring.
They both have teeth.

370
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:35,106
You push down on the spring,
disengage the teeth like that.

371
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,443
You see? This is what happens inside.

372
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,613
- And the cuffs release.
- Wow.

373
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,991
Hands free.

374
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,720
Get away.

375
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,140
Get away.

376
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:13,186
No, no, no, no, no. Let him.
He's our friend, Malay.

377
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,189
Let him do it. It's the best way
to heal sores around here.

378
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,523
Okay.

379
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,192
Hey,

380
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,112
that cuff thing, that's good, real good.

381
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,281
Yeah. Thanks.

382
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,950
Hey, Duane,

383
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,789
do you know where we are?
I mean, you have any idea?

384
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:36,959
No. But my guess
is that this here's still Laos.

385
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,587
And the guards, they're ... 

386
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:40,755
- Laotian.
 ... Laotian?

387
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,590
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but the camp is Vietcong,

388
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,300
there's no question.

389
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,844
Look, I know what you're thinking,

390
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,973
but jungles on these mountains
is a nightmare.

391
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,812
Besides, you'd end up in Vietnam.

392
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,523
- No, but if we can get to Thailand ... 
- Yeah.

393
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,274
If we can make it to the Mekong River ... 

394
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,401
Yeah, the Big Muddy.
If you could, you would, right?

395
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,945
Yeah. We can.

396
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,657
- Hey, why not? We can.
- Yeah.

397
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,243
Just stop talking about it. Okay?

398
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,328
Just quiet. Excuse me.

399
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,834
- Hey, Gene.
- Yeah.

400
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,506
Which of you guys knows most
about the country?

401
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:28,135
Oh, that would be Phisit,
but he doesn't talk to us.

402
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,012
What do you mean?

403
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,890
You see, Phisit is pissed about ... 

404
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:34,934
But ... 

405
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,648
He's pissed about something.

406
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:45,027
We don't even remember
what he's pissed about.

407
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,508
Hey!

408
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,469
Hey, come back!

409
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,056
Hey!

410
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,311
I can't believe that bastard shot you.

411
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,355
I know. I didn't even pull down
my flight suit.

412
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,816
Hey, look, when I was standing
it looked like ... 

413
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,112
We're gonna get even one day.

414
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,204
Howdy.

415
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,548
Americaly.

416
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:54,347
- Americaly.
- Americaly. Americaly. Americaly.

417
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,455
Two years ago a parcel came through.

418
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,167
Yeah.

419
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,837
He puts it on display on really bad days.

420
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:32,051
The bacon label still looks greasy.

421
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,804
Does it still have a scent on it?

422
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,305
Oh, you bet.

423
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,809
Can I get a sniff?

424
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,602
Oh, no, you may not.

425
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,189
You may not. That is my sniff.

426
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,401
Man, that is my sniff.

427
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,040
Hey.

428
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,794
How'd you ever end up a pilot?

429
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,132
I always ... I always wanted to be one.

430
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,467
I was

431
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:19,181
five years old, or something, in a little
town, Wildberg, in the Black Forest,

432
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,601
and it was just bombed to ashes,
you know?

433
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,604
No clear reason,
just these senseless attacks.

434
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:31,944
But I remember I was in the attic
with my brother.

435
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,448
We were looking out,

436
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:39,452
and we see this fighter plane,

437
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,539
beautiful, coming right at us.

438
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,375
And it's firing from its wings,

439
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,629
and I see the machine gun,
it's flashing and it

440
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,633
goes flying past the house.

441
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:59,805
It's so close. I mean,
it's feet away from the house.

442
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,602
And the canopy was open.

443
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:11,734
And this pilot,
he had his goggles up on his helmet.

444
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,029
And I could see his eyes.

445
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,074
And he was looking at me.

446
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,242
Right at me.

447
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,078
He's looking right at me.

448
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:25,623
And as he turns to go, he's starting back,
he's looking right at me still.

449
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,458
And the thing is,

450
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,796
from that moment on, little Dieter,

451
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,840
he needed to fly.

452
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:40,179
You're a strange bird, Dieter.

453
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,682
Guy tries to kill you and you want his job.

454
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,605
Yeah.

455
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,304
God, we need the rain.

456
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,724
We need the rain to come quicker.

457
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:34,650
See, here's what I can see,
you still need to understand.

458
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:38,320
- No, I understand.
- You wanna talk about the rain again, we ... 

459
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,322
Listen, now. Listen.

460
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:45,286
We will be released
by the time the rain comes

461
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,996
like I have told you before ... 

462
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,499
- Stop telling me.
- I don't wanna have to keep telling you.

463
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,502
- Then stop telling me.
- They will release us.

464
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,753
You understand?

465
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,630
And here's what I'm starting to think,

466
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,758
that maybe you're trying
not to understand.

467
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,929
If you try and escape, we,

468
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,850
we will be killed,
we who you leave behind.

469
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,394
- It's not just me, we all try to escape.
- Taking off. We who have been here

470
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,438
for two years.

471
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,356
Two years before you showed up.

472
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,067
I don't want to escape alone.
We escape together.

473
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,070
Wait, wait.
Why would the guards spend all this time

474
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,948
cutting bamboo and wood
to build a watchtower

475
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,742
if we weren't meant
to be here for a while?

476
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:25,868
- Exactly.
- Two years.

477
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,037
- Exactly. Why would they do that if they ... 
- Listen. Listen to me.

478
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:31,081
 ... didn't plan to hold us a long time?
- Listen. Here's what it all comes down to.

479
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:35,544
I am not, I'm not gonna let you do that.

480
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,837
No, no, no.

481
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,589
You know what I am gonna do?

482
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,341
I am gonna scream.

483
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:44,136
That's right. I think
I'm gonna scream my head off.

484
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:54,146
'Cause see, I would much 
rather they shoot you,

485
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,816
than me, or any of us. You understand?

486
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,195
Yeah.

487
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,447
You understand?

488
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,740
Yeah.

489
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,077
You've been warned.

490
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,496
Haven't you?

491
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,357
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

492
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,319
This is for shaving.

493
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,113
Howdy.

494
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,753
- Man, I can't get over it.
- What, this?

495
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,005
No, that girl, you know?

496
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,715
She smiled at me.

497
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:47,509
And when she smiled,

498
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:52,514
man, did I wish there was no war.

499
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,640
Really.

500
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,560
- I thought you were engaged.
- Oh, yeah, I am.

501
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,479
We got engaged the day before I left.

502
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:03,067
Marina, she is a wonderful girl.
So smart, you know?

503
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,402
She studies marine biology.

504
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,113
But I hope that she's waiting for me.

505
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,452
- I'm sure she is.
- Yeah, well, she said she would,

506
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,038
but, you know, women can be funny
and go looking for another man ... 

507
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,348
Duane, you okay?

508
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,183
- Yeah.
- Y.C.?

509
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,226
Yik Chiu Tuo, okay.

510
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,103
Okay. Gene?

511
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,646
Phisit? Procet?

512
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,855
Yeah.

513
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,359
It is May the 22nd?

514
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,111
Happy birthday.

515
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,155
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday, Dieter.

516
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,532
What kind of champagne is this?

517
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:36,201
You just got to keep thinking protein,
lots of protein.

518
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,786
It's not bad.

519
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,205
Squished insect larva.

520
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,584
Protein.

521
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,294
Mmm.

522
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,298
Oh, this is a good year, this one.

523
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,341
Yeah, my favorite.

524
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,051
So, listen, guys.

525
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,137
Thank you so much.

526
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,097
And it is my birthday, yes,

527
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:00,309
but I would like
to give you some presents.

528
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,728
Okay. Now, look.

529
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:08,984
I have taken these cartridge shells
and I have made a knife of each one.

530
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,278
Okay.

531
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:16,074
Now, I'm sorry, but I have to keep one
for myself. Okay?

532
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,410
Duane, you're first.

533
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,204
Right.

534
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,124
Phisit.

535
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,126
Left or right?

536
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,421
Y.C.

537
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,758
Easy money, pal.

538
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,261
Gene.

539
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:43,310
- Procet, it is yours. Okay.
- I don't care about the knife.

540
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,436
This is for Crazy Horse.

541
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,272
No, no, no. Crazy Horse is mine.

542
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,317
My Crazy Horse. Mine.

543
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:55,864
Now listen, we must collect the rice
and hide it.

544
00:58:56,533 --> 00:59:00,035
But we must dry it because it rots
too quickly if we don't dry it, okay?

545
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,204
What? Hide it? You wanna hide it?

546
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,622
- Yeah, yeah.
- We can eat it now.

547
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,957
- No, no.
- We eat it now.

548
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:09,044
Look, look, look, I've created
a secret compartment here for the rice.

549
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:13,298
It is at the bottom of my crap container.

550
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,591
So I don't think the guards

551
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,969
- are gonna want to check that.
- Crazy. This is ... 

552
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,680
Why are you hiding it now?

553
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,306
For our escape.

554
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,520
You have a plan.

555
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:27,980
Yes.

556
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,567
Now, have you noticed

557
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,778
that the guards when they are called
to the kitchen hut for chow time,

558
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,863
they always leave
their rifles behind, always?

559
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:41,118
So we have a few minutes
before they return for their rifles.

560
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:44,121
We go out through the hut,
we grab their guns,

561
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,414
- we surprise them.
- No.

562
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,417
- And we surprise ... We surprise them ... 
- Crazy.

563
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,127
 ... and we surround them, okay?

564
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:54,172
Then we take the guards as prisoners.

565
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,092
We take over the camp.
Think about it, okay?

566
00:59:57,176 --> 01:00:01,263
We hold it down for a few days
until we can signal our aircraft

567
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,182
to pick us up.

568
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,831
- Dieter, quick.
- Okay.

569
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,294
They'll call mess any second.

570
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,505
Quick, quick.

571
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:12,334
- Who's in the kitchen?
- I see four.

572
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:16,672
The cook, Little Hitler and Nook the Rook
and somebody I've never seen before.

573
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,757
He looks like a villager.

574
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,093
- What about the rifles?
- Okay, rifles.

575
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:26,223
Little Hitler's rifle
and Nook's rifle in Hut A.

576
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:30,811
And, okay, Crazy Horse
going towards Hut B

577
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,522
with his submachine gun. Okay.

578
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,691
There's somebody else coming up
over the hillside.

579
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,192
- Who?
- I can't make him out,

580
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:39,277
but he has a machete. Okay.

581
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,821
Oh, shit.

582
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,823
Nook the Rook is coming back
with his food.

583
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,282
Quick. Quick.

584
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:50,997
Hooks in now. Hide the nail. Hide the nail.

585
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,499
- Got it?
- Yeah.

586
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,292
Okay. Okay.

587
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,715
Close it.

588
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:31,580
Nice, because we all happen to be ... 

589
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:34,916
Hungry

590
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:42,716
Hungry

591
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,925
- Hey, Duane.
- What?

592
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,594
Okay. Your turn.

593
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,262
- What, my turn?
- Yeah.

594
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:49,890
- Stack it up.
- Oh, all right. You ready?

595
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,351
- Bottom shelf, raspberry pie.
- Okay.

596
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:56,730
The way my mom makes it
with the crust as thick as a steak.

597
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:59,483
- Yeah.
- And on top shelf is a turkey.

598
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,026
I'm not talking Thanksgiving big.

599
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:05,822
I'm talking, you know, an obscene,
enormous, like, 35-pound turkey

600
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:09,117
with breasts the size of Jayne Mansfield's.
You know what I mean?

601
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,580
You've got gravy, stuffing,
six-pack of Budweiser ... 

602
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:14,873
No, no, no, no.

603
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:18,627
No, I prefer the Bavarian stein. You know?

604
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:22,297
With a quarter of a gallon
and it's dark and it's cool

605
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:25,133
and you get the foam lapping up

606
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,177
- and coming over the side.
- Yeah. Okay.

607
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:30,555
- It's so cool you get the mist on the side ... 
- All right, that's in your fridge.

608
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,141
- This is my fridge. Right?
- Okay.

609
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,101
- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- Six-pack stays where it is.

610
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,686
Yeah. It's okay.

611
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,021
- Muffins.
- Okay.

612
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:41,149
- Yeah.
- Okay, oranges, couple of dozen eggs.

613
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:46,655
- All right.
- And, oh, a pile ... A huge pile of pancakes

614
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:51,701
- with tons of syrup, I mean, just soaked.
- Why always the sweet stuff?

615
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,286
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Why always the sweet stuff?

616
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,663
- You stack the fridge. Go ahead.
- Okay.

617
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:57,999
- It's my turn.
- Noodles and Spam, okay.

618
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,001
No, okay. Sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead.

619
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,170
- It's your turn. You go.
- Right.

620
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,339
- Some cake.
- Yeah.

621
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,091
See, you ruined it.

622
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,426
Why you always got to interrupt me?

623
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:10,762
God.

624
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,102
Okay, rifle one and rifle two in Hut A.

625
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,940
Submachine gun in Hut B
and another rifle in Hut C.

626
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,484
- That's new. Are you sure?
- Affirmative.

627
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:28,363
And in the kitchen
we have Nook the Rook,

628
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,782
Crazy Horse and Jumbo arriving.

629
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,996
Jumbo's gun?

630
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,123
- Jumbo's gun?
- Duane.

631
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,959
- What?
- Duane.

632
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,176
It's just a game.

633
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:53,138
It's just a game.

634
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,225
I won.

635
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,176
Phisit.

636
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,554
Hold this side up.

637
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:41,538
Come on.

638
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,356
Do you see it?

639
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:13,278
No.

640
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,074
- I see it.
- Yeah, that's because you dug it.

641
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,368
You did a good job, trust me.

642
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,843
I've seen clouds, okay?

643
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:39,596
When does the monsoon start?

644
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:40,930
I don't know.

645
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,807
Could be another two weeks.

646
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,392
- No, no, no, no.
- Or a month.

647
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,727
No, no, no, no, no.

648
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,896
- Maybe five days.
- Okay. No.

649
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,482
We need to set a start date

650
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:55,403
because the guards, you know,
they are starving as well.

651
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:58,948
And they are getting
meaner and meaner, so ... 

652
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:02,786
I don't care about anything else.
Your plan, I don't care.

653
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,746
- You can stay behind ... 
- Listen to me.

654
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,082
 ... if you want.
- Listen to me now.

655
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,917
- How about that?
- Listen ... 

656
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:11,669
Dieter, I'm on board.

657
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:14,506
I'd rather be dead out there
than rotting away in here.

658
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,882
Okay, buddy. Okay.

659
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,842
Y.C., are you on board?

660
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:22,263
I guess so.

661
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:25,350
- Okay. Procet?
- I am out.

662
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:29,604
- You are out of the plan?
- I am. No, no, I want to get out.

663
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:32,732
You're coming with us out.
Great. Okay, Phisit?

664
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,948
That's a yes. So ... 

665
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:42,075
So,

666
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,702
it is settled then.

667
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,663
Okay.

668
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:52,210
July the 4th.

669
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,129
No matter what.

670
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:57,715
Okay.

671
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:47,098
We had this two years ago
when it was really bad.

672
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:50,268
- How can it get any worse?
- Really bad.

673
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:53,438
You don't ask, you just eat.

674
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:59,152
You just smile, smile and eat.
Duane, Duane, Duane.

675
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:00,278
- Come on.
- No.

676
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,697
You got to try. It's protein.

677
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,908
Protein's not gonna kill you.

678
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,284
Just try.

679
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:07,994
Hey.

680
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:23,801
I am going to eat my rice.

681
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,054
- I'm gonna eat my rice.
- No, you are not.

682
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,348
I'm gonna eat that rice.

683
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:32,143
I'm gonna eat that rice
because it is my rice.

684
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:35,563
- You are not.
- I will eat my rice.

685
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,065
We're not gonna eat that rice.

686
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:38,566
My rice.

687
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,319
That is not your rice. That is our rice.

688
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:42,445
- Okay.
- Oh, I see.

689
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:44,322
And I tell you what.

690
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:49,118
I'm not gonna let you out of
your handcuffs tonight, okay?

691
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,871
Because I still have the key.

692
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,297
Oh, I see. I see.

693
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,716
Let me see if I have this right.

694
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,469
You're the warden himself now.

695
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:09,806
Is that right? Is that right?
Do I have that right?

696
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:16,187
Okay?

697
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,531
- Dieter.
- No.

698
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,371
- Dieter.
- No.

699
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,045
Oh, God.

700
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,881
Come on, Dieter, open the cuffs.

701
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,091
No.

702
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:49,679
You, you are on my list right
after Crazy Horse.

703
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,014
Cut that crap, you know?

704
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,766
Because I will do you in two seconds flat.

705
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,936
- Okay.
- Hey, hey, hey. You are on my list.

706
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:59,480
On my list.

707
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,859
That's right.

708
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,079
No food.

709
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:17,915
Go away, there's no food today.

710
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:19,709
No food.

711
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:28,634
Dieter.

712
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,095
- You should apologize.
- Okay.

713
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,889
I was just making a point.

714
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:34,682
You should apologize to Gene.

715
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:39,270
You are not gonna keep me prisoner.
I said you are not gonna keep me prisoner.

716
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,439
Oh, and you are not the one
that I'm afraid of, okay,

717
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:44,025
because the man who will frighten me
has to be born yet.

718
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:46,235
- Come on, apologize.
- Okay?

719
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:49,572
Okay.

720
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:51,991
Gene, I apologize.

721
01:12:54,161 --> 01:13:01,793
Gene.

722
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:05,338
Hey, I'm really sorry.

723
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:11,386
Okay?

724
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,225
I'm sorry.

725
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:18,851
Okay.

726
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:50,716
Motherfucker!

727
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,564
I think they believe we call in aircraft.

728
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,112
- I can't take this.
-  Duane. Duane.

729
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,448
- You hang in.
- I can't take it anymore.

730
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:14,866
You hang in.

731
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,161
I'm your true friend.

732
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,163
I'm your true friend. I would not lie to you.

733
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:22,457
I will never let you down, okay?

734
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:28,629
- Okay.
- Never.

735
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:29,881
Okay.

736
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,700
Hey.

737
01:14:58,118 --> 01:14:59,494
So, listen.

738
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,747
Once we have got the guards,

739
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,083
we are gonna set up a perimeter.

740
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:09,086
If reinforcements come along
this jungle path ... 

741
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:12,548
They're having some kind 
of discussion in the kitchen.

742
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:16,093
I understand what they are saying.
I just need to hear.

743
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:31,776
Hey, what's going on?

744
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,110
Silence.

745
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:38,741
So what are they saying?

746
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:40,493
What they're discussing is this.

747
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:43,329
They sent some villagers out
to forage for some rice.

748
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:45,373
- Yeah?
- They came back with nothing.

749
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:49,168
Ever since the bombings,
the entire province cannot grow rice.

750
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:50,920
I didn't think it could get any worse.

751
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:53,214
No, it's much worse than that.

752
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:57,260
They plan to march us out
in the jungle and kill us,

753
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:00,471
and make it look
as if we were trying to escape.

754
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:06,227
They wanna all go back to their villages
and somehow try to get some food.

755
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:09,689
The ringleaders are Little Hitler
and Crazy Horse.

756
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:12,316
- I knew it.
- Okay, so

757
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:15,778
it has to be tomorrow.

758
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,446
Come here.

759
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,116
Procet.

760
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:26,914
We are still a day short
of Independence Day, but so what.

761
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:30,293
Hey, there's no rain.

762
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:33,045
Tomorrow,

763
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,590
chow time.

764
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:41,906
So then, Duane and l

765
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:46,661
will go this way outside of the fence.

766
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:51,666
The four of you will go this way outside
of the fence.

767
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:55,836
And we must all arrive at the kitchen

768
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:59,840
at the same moment to encircle them.

769
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:03,761
This is the most important thing, okay?

770
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:08,224
And then you two,
you will interrogate the guards.

771
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:22,488
Okay. Where the hell is the tower?

772
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:24,949
Where's the tower?

773
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,788
Okay. Yes. Those three are in the kitchen.
I think that is it.

774
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,998
I think they're all in the kitchen, I think.

775
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,376
This is it. I'm going.

776
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:41,424
Dieter, good luck.

777
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,357
Quiet, quiet.

778
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:13,557
Quickly. Kitchen. Kitchen.
Meet us at the kitchen. Yes? Okay.

779
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:40,459
Duane, come on. Come on. Oh, God.

780
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:51,554
Oh, God, there are six or seven
or something.

781
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,897
Gene! Procet! Come on!

782
01:21:11,157 --> 01:21:13,868
Procet! Gene!
Where the hell are you?

783
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:16,996
Gene! Damn you, where are ... 
Duane, come on!

784
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:20,875
Duane, where the hell are you!

785
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,585
Jumbo, don't try anything.

786
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:24,879
Go on! Go on, run!

787
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,171
Run!

788
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:28,007
God damn you!

789
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,134
Where are the shoes?

790
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:34,555
The shoes are always hanging here.
Look for them! Go on, look for them.

791
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:38,183
This is terrible. This is terrible.

792
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:39,852
Come on. Get something. Get this bag.

793
01:21:39,936 --> 01:21:41,812
- There's no shoes.
- Get this bag.

794
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,398
Get as much as you can.

795
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:46,609
God damn you, Gene!

796
01:21:46,693 --> 01:21:48,444
God damn you!

797
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:53,574
We have to leave. We have to leave.
The guards will be coming back.

798
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:54,950
Come on.

799
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,902
Duane. Duane. Not in the open.
Not in the open. Come on. Come on.

800
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,590
Dieter.

801
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:58,472
Y. C., what the hell happened?
Why didn't you show up at the kitchen?

802
01:22:58,556 --> 01:23:01,392
Gene? Gene, where the hell were you?

803
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:04,311
Gene, where the hell have you been?

804
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:07,189
Did you hear the shooting? Did you?

805
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:09,316
I couldn't get a shot.

806
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:13,904
Oh, you couldn't get a shot at them.
You weren't there to get a shot at them.

807
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,740
Look at these. What nice shoes you have.

808
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,576
Where are our shoes?
Where are our shoes?

809
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:22,579
Phisit.

810
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:26,375
You're telling me that he took
three pairs of shoes?

811
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:29,628
He took his, he took Duane's
and he took mine?

812
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,005
- That's right.
- Yeah.

813
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,131
- Yeah.
-  That's right.

814
01:23:32,215 --> 01:23:34,591
So, you were busy getting your machetes

815
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:37,302
and your nice shoes
while we were being shot at.

816
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:40,931
Okay. Where was this rifle?
Where did you find this rifle?

817
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,017
Where'd you get that?

818
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:44,351
Where am I gonna go?

819
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:47,021
I don't know where you're gonna go.
Where'd you get the rifle?

820
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:50,774
Or did you just find that?
You just found it lying around?

821
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:52,860
We found it.

822
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,361
Okay, listen, that's it.

823
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:57,614
Listen, I have an ammo clip for you.

824
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,325
My ammo clip for your machete.

825
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:01,952
Oh, yeah.

826
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,914
Oh, that's funny?

827
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:09,418
- Why is that funny?
- 'Cause I was just thinking,

828
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:14,298
maybe you'll go back and get one yourself.

829
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,383
Maybe I'll go back
and get one myself? Okay.

830
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:18,385
Happy now you got 
to do your big plan?

831
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,971
Yes.

832
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:23,223
Yeah, I bet you're happy.

833
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:34,777
You hand me that machete.

834
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:41,492
You tell me where to go.

835
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:46,038
I don't know where you can go.

836
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,291
I didn't think so.

837
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:51,335
Didn't think so.

838
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,133
Gene. Gene.

839
01:24:58,218 --> 01:24:59,760
What's that? What's that?

840
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:01,345
Yeah, Dieter.

841
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:04,556
Is that where you're going?

842
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:09,019
See you, Duane. Duane, love you, brother.
You go that way, I'll go this way.

843
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:13,232
But where am I gonna go?

844
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,820
I'm gonna go over there.

845
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:27,246
Where am I gonna go?

846
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,183
Dieter.

847
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:51,687
It's gonna rain.

848
01:25:52,438 --> 01:25:53,564
I know it.

849
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:55,858
This is how it always starts.

850
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:25,906
Duane.

851
01:27:28,868 --> 01:27:30,327
Look at this.

852
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,955
You see over there?

853
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:36,458
See?

854
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,503
Down there must be a river.

855
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,838
It must lead to the Big Muddy.

856
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:44,758
And then we'll be out of here.

857
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:48,553
We'll build a raft, and we can float
all the way down to it.

858
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:50,055
No one will see us.

859
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:52,724
Then we can cross over into Thailand.

860
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:50,509
Listen.

861
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,844
Do you hear that?

862
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:57,015
Is that a waterfall?

863
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:09,528
Waterfall! Waterfall, bail out!

864
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:11,988
Dieter!

865
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:25,210
Dieter!

866
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:39,099
- Careful!
- The shore!

867
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:41,101
Grab the shore!

868
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:59,090
Hey, pick a hand.

869
01:34:02,386 --> 01:34:03,428
No.

870
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:12,187
Which one of your feet is worse off?

871
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,939
That's a trick question, right?

872
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,325
We can trade off with this thing.

873
01:34:26,952 --> 01:34:30,538
There's no way
that we shoot it out with the Vietcong

874
01:34:30,623 --> 01:34:32,415
if we run into them, so ... 

875
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:37,087
And we can't use these for hunting
because of the noise.

876
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:41,883
You wanna ditch them?

877
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:44,594
Yeah.

878
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:57,107
I'm sick of carrying these, anyway.

879
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:23,800
Oh, God.

880
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,166
Duane.

881
01:35:58,461 --> 01:35:59,627
We got to move.

882
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:01,212
I'm too tired.

883
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:03,798
- Keep moving.
- No, I'm too tired.

884
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,342
Come on, buddy.

885
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,847
I can't go on any longer.

886
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:52,222
Duane.

887
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:54,974
These are huts.

888
01:36:55,726 --> 01:36:59,437
This is an abandoned village.

889
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:02,816
This is a hut.

890
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:05,360
No.

891
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:07,862
- Yeah.
- It's all jungle.

892
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,573
Be careful.

893
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:34,013
- I'm done.
- No.

894
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,724
Travel by night.

895
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:38,893
No, I'm telling you, I can't go any further.

896
01:37:38,978 --> 01:37:40,937
You just leave me here.

897
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:44,107
We'll travel by night.

898
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,025
I help you along.

899
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,987
When we reach the Big Muddy,
we'll make it across,

900
01:37:49,071 --> 01:37:53,908
and I'm sure we're gonna run right
into an American officers' club.

901
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:56,619
And we're gonna go
straight into the kitchen,

902
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:59,706
and we're gonna order a burger
and French fries

903
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,792
and milkshake and ice cream sundaes.

904
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:05,628
All that sweet stuff that you like.

905
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:12,969
Duane! Duane! There's choppers!

906
01:38:13,053 --> 01:38:15,013
Duane! Duane, look!

907
01:38:15,097 --> 01:38:18,266
There's ... Oh, here we are!

908
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:19,809
Here we are!

909
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:23,021
Oh, please! Please, be real!

910
01:38:23,105 --> 01:38:26,524
Here we are! It's your buddies!
It's your buddies!

911
01:38:26,609 --> 01:38:28,276
Oh, yes!

912
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,904
Thank you! Thank you!

913
01:38:30,988 --> 01:38:33,740
We're here! We're here!

914
01:38:34,074 --> 01:38:35,450
No!

915
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:37,201
We're here!

916
01:38:38,037 --> 01:38:39,996
Where are you going?

917
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:42,832
We are here!

918
01:38:43,792 --> 01:38:45,376
Stop!

919
01:38:47,212 --> 01:38:50,173
You idiots, where are you going?

920
01:38:58,223 --> 01:39:02,477
Please.

921
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:07,523
Please come back.

922
01:39:30,005 --> 01:39:31,547
- Keep your voice down.
- Duane.

923
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:32,799
- Dieter.
- Duane.

924
01:39:32,883 --> 01:39:35,343
- The guards are coming.
- Duane,

925
01:39:36,887 --> 01:39:41,808
I'm not speaking.

926
01:39:43,227 --> 01:39:47,313
God, why don't you help us
when we need you most?

927
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:50,400
Keep your voice down. They're coming.

928
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:04,038
Come here.

929
01:40:04,915 --> 01:40:06,207
Lie down.

930
01:40:14,591 --> 01:40:16,092
Lie down there.

931
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:18,803
Lie down.

932
01:40:19,972 --> 01:40:21,264
Okay.

933
01:40:23,767 --> 01:40:28,438
Listen, I'm gonna build
a fire tonight, a big one.

934
01:40:28,605 --> 01:40:31,315
And those helicopters, they will see it.

935
01:40:31,608 --> 01:40:33,359
And they will come for us.

936
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:35,570
Okay, they will come for us.

937
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:44,037
Come on, come on.

938
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:46,622
Yes.

939
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:29,290
Here we are!

940
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:33,711
Here we are! Oh, yes!

941
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:37,465
Oh, thank God! Oh, yes!

942
01:41:37,549 --> 01:41:38,800
Yeah!

943
01:41:39,301 --> 01:41:40,718
Yes!

944
01:41:50,604 --> 01:41:52,313
You idiots!

945
01:41:52,397 --> 01:41:54,649
You almost killed me!

946
01:42:51,915 --> 01:42:54,333
I dreamed there was a fire.

947
01:42:56,837 --> 01:43:01,549
Why did they think a whole damn village
would be burning?

948
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:04,677
How could we be Vietcong?

949
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:10,016
Now they must've heard us.

950
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:11,684
They must've seen this.

951
01:43:11,768 --> 01:43:15,771
The Vietcong will be on their way.
They could be here any moment.

952
01:43:19,651 --> 01:43:20,943
Let's leave here.

953
01:45:38,957 --> 01:45:40,499
Dieter.

954
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:45,546
Dieter.

955
01:45:49,217 --> 01:45:50,843
My feet are cold.

956
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:33,571
I'm cold.

957
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,075
My feet are cold.

958
01:47:44,249 --> 01:47:46,125
You can have the sole.

959
01:48:00,056 --> 01:48:01,223
Duane?

960
01:49:53,295 --> 01:49:55,170
Hey, you!

961
01:49:56,339 --> 01:49:58,007
I'm here!

962
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:02,511
Please turn around.

963
01:50:05,515 --> 01:50:07,099
Hey!

964
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:12,813
Don't leave. Hey!

965
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:16,984
Hey! Hey!

966
01:50:21,364 --> 01:50:27,119
Don't go away.

967
01:50:32,542 --> 01:50:33,834
Hey!

968
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:36,587
Oh, come on!

969
01:50:39,132 --> 01:50:40,883
Oh, please!

970
01:50:41,176 --> 01:50:42,718
Come on!

971
01:50:51,186 --> 01:50:54,396
Okay. Hey!

972
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:58,567
Over here! Over here!

973
01:50:58,652 --> 01:51:01,070
Help me! Come on, come on, come on.

974
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:04,448
Come on down. Yeah, come on.

975
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:10,329
They're coming.

976
01:51:14,542 --> 01:51:16,585
Yes! Yes, please!

977
01:51:17,962 --> 01:51:19,546
See me!

978
01:51:28,264 --> 01:51:29,264
Yes!

979
01:52:28,783 --> 01:52:30,325
Who are you, buddy?

980
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:31,785
Name?

981
01:52:32,162 --> 01:52:37,583
Flight Lieutenant Dieter Dengler,
U.S.S. Ranger.

982
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:38,917
Authenticator?

983
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:40,169
- What's your authenticator?
- Rescue Dawn.

984
01:52:40,253 --> 01:52:41,503
- Rescue Dawn.
- Louder!

985
01:52:41,588 --> 01:52:43,130
Rescue Dawn!

986
01:52:43,214 --> 01:52:46,049
- Favorite sport?
- Hunting.

987
01:52:46,134 --> 01:52:48,343
Favorite fish?

988
01:52:48,428 --> 01:52:49,553
Trout.

989
01:52:49,637 --> 01:52:51,597
Confirmed. Confirmed. It's him!

990
01:52:51,681 --> 01:52:53,849
I can't believe it.

991
01:52:53,933 --> 01:52:56,059
Jesus, buddy, you made it out of the bush.

992
01:52:56,144 --> 01:52:57,603
Bring him home!

993
01:52:58,938 --> 01:53:00,773
He's coming home with us.

994
01:53:00,857 --> 01:53:03,358
- Oh, shit!
- Going home.

995
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:04,777
All right.

996
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:10,783
Way to go, buddy.

997
01:54:00,583 --> 01:54:02,376
Easy, easy, easy.

998
01:54:03,211 --> 01:54:06,839
Hold up here, hold up here.
Hey, everyone listen to me.

999
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:08,799
- We're in charge here.
- Back up. Back up.

1000
01:54:08,883 --> 01:54:12,135
This man has been on
a highly classified operation. Hold.

1001
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:15,180
No one is to see him. No one is
to touch him. No one is to talk to him.

1002
01:54:15,265 --> 01:54:17,349
- Get him inside.
- You'll forget what you've seen.

1003
01:54:17,433 --> 01:54:20,769
ln fact, from now on,
it's a black operation. Is that clear?

1004
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:21,937
You got me on that?

1005
01:54:22,021 --> 01:54:23,480
- Back up. Back up.
- Stand back.

1006
01:54:23,565 --> 01:54:25,107
All right. Let's go.

1007
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,444
You're doing great, Dieter.

1008
01:54:29,779 --> 01:54:31,905
You don't need this anymore.

1009
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:40,038
Hey, when can I go 
back to my ship?

1010
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:43,625
I don't know.

1011
01:55:12,989 --> 01:55:15,157
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

1012
01:55:17,619 --> 01:55:19,745
You guys are a lot of fun.

1013
01:55:19,829 --> 01:55:24,374
You know, how many times I have to
tell you? I don't know the coordinates.

1014
01:55:24,459 --> 01:55:26,960
Let's go back to the guards.
Tell me about their uniforms.

1015
01:55:27,045 --> 01:55:30,380
There were some with red stars,
maybe they're Vietcong.

1016
01:55:30,465 --> 01:55:32,758
The others were Laotians ... 

1017
01:55:32,842 --> 01:55:35,594
Oh, no.

1018
01:55:37,972 --> 01:55:39,222
Dieter!

1019
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:40,641
There's my buddies.

1020
01:55:40,725 --> 01:55:43,810
- Happy birthday.
- That's my buddies.

1021
01:55:43,895 --> 01:55:45,103
You made it.

1022
01:55:45,188 --> 01:55:47,314
It's good to see you, Spook.

1023
01:55:48,483 --> 01:55:49,608
Dieter.

1024
01:55:49,692 --> 01:55:52,277
Norman. Oh, my God.

1025
01:55:52,362 --> 01:55:54,613
Gentlemen, can you give us
a couple of minutes alone, please?

1026
01:55:54,697 --> 01:55:56,114
It should be all right.

1027
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:58,992
I got a little letter from his fiancée.

1028
01:55:59,077 --> 01:56:01,036
It's kind of personal.
You know what I mean?

1029
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:02,955
Keep it personal, Lieutenant.

1030
01:56:03,039 --> 01:56:06,083
We're in the middle of
a highly classified debriefing.

1031
01:56:06,167 --> 01:56:07,709
Will do. It's from his old lady.

1032
01:56:07,794 --> 01:56:09,378
- Ten minutes.
- Okay.

1033
01:56:09,462 --> 01:56:11,004
Thank you, gentlemen.

1034
01:56:11,089 --> 01:56:12,172
Thank you.

1035
01:56:12,256 --> 01:56:17,010
Hey, Spook, what's with the birthday ... 
It's not my birthday.

1036
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:22,015
Dieter, those two CIA dudes wanna take
you back to Guam for debriefing.

1037
01:56:22,725 --> 01:56:25,060
You don't wanna do that, do you?

1038
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:27,688
I didn't think so.

1039
01:56:48,918 --> 01:56:50,377
Hey, hold on, guys.

1040
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:54,840
Hey, guys, he's a bit choked up in there.

1041
01:56:55,591 --> 01:57:00,095
You mind giving him just a couple of
minutes to sort of pull himself together?

1042
01:57:00,179 --> 01:57:02,723
Yeah, it should be fine.
We'll give it a few minutes.

1043
01:57:02,807 --> 01:57:04,933
- He's a good kid, huh?
- Yeah.

1044
01:57:05,018 --> 01:57:06,727
- Thanks, guys.
- Yup.

1045
01:57:15,737 --> 01:57:21,450
 ... Right, left.
Left, left, left, right, left.

1046
01:57:26,372 --> 01:57:27,831
Come on, now.

1047
01:57:29,751 --> 01:57:31,918
Hurry up. Come on, get him in.

1048
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:35,047
Get him in now, fast!

1049
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:36,465
Get inside.

1050
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:51,396
It's my day!

1051
01:58:01,949 --> 01:58:03,575
What are we doing?

1052
01:58:22,845 --> 01:58:24,096
- Hey.
- What?

1053
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:25,889
Where is everybody?

1054
01:58:25,973 --> 01:58:26,973
- Where?
- Right here.

1055
01:58:27,058 --> 01:58:29,434
Why the decks ... They're empty.
Have they gone home?

1056
01:58:29,519 --> 01:58:31,978
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1057
01:58:32,522 --> 01:58:33,605
They're on vacation.

1058
01:58:33,689 --> 01:58:35,357
Is the war over?

1059
01:58:36,734 --> 01:58:37,859
No.

1060
01:58:43,741 --> 01:58:46,201
You know I'm in a lot of trouble.

1061
01:58:53,084 --> 01:58:54,793
Boys, here he is.

1062
01:58:54,877 --> 01:58:57,295
They kidnapped him,
they brought him here to us.

1063
01:58:57,380 --> 01:59:00,465
The CIA held him for four days
but they can't hang onto him forever!

1064
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:03,093
Dieter Dengler!

1065
01:59:09,225 --> 01:59:12,602
All right, all right. Hold on.
Hold on a second.

1066
01:59:12,687 --> 01:59:14,146
Boys, listen up for a second.

1067
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:16,731
Admiral Willoughby's
got something to say.

1068
01:59:16,816 --> 01:59:18,567
Lieutenant Dengler.

1069
01:59:21,487 --> 01:59:23,363
Good to have you back.

1070
01:59:27,118 --> 01:59:29,077
- Thank you.
- All right. That's not all.

1071
01:59:29,162 --> 01:59:32,664
There's more! Hold on, fellows.
Hold on, hold on!

1072
01:59:33,708 --> 01:59:35,125
So, let's start with the man himself.

1073
01:59:35,209 --> 01:59:37,127
Dieter, it is just incredible
you made it home.

1074
01:59:37,211 --> 01:59:40,422
Now, tell us, was it your faith
in God and country?

1075
01:59:41,757 --> 01:59:44,342
Come on, Dieter,
you got to believe in something.

1076
01:59:44,427 --> 01:59:46,052
I believe I need a steak.

1077
01:59:46,137 --> 01:59:48,889
A steak! This guy needs a steak!

1078
01:59:48,973 --> 01:59:51,099
We're grilling up a big old cow for you.

1079
01:59:51,184 --> 01:59:54,311
All right. Hey, listen up. Hang on.

1080
01:59:54,395 --> 01:59:56,771
Can you pass something on to the boys?

1081
01:59:56,856 --> 01:59:58,440
You know, something you learned
during your ordeal,

1082
01:59:58,524 --> 02:00:02,527
something to keep them going
no matter how bad it gets?

1083
02:00:03,237 --> 02:00:04,613
Sure I can.

1084
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:10,577
Empty what is full.

1085
02:00:11,913 --> 02:00:14,539
Fill what is empty.

1086
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:21,296
Scratch where it itches. That's it.

1087
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:23,048
Now look at these boys' faces.

1088
02:00:23,132 --> 02:00:25,091
Do they love you, man!

1089
02:00:25,176 --> 02:00:28,845
Do they love you!
