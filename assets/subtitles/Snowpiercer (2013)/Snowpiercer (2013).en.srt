1
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:21,671
Good day.

2
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:25,174
On this day, July 1st 2014...

3
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,510
at this hour, 0600...

4
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:30,263
we are at the very first airport in the world...

5
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:33,766
...topic of so much controversy
over the past 7 years...

6
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,978
has continued development.

7
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:40,941
Protests from environmental groups and a number of
developing countries continue.

8
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,114
...It had been claimed The CW7 is the answer
to global warming.

9
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:48,948
And we are witnesses.

10
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:53,037
...Leaders who argue that global warming
can no longer be ignored.

11
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:57,540
Today, 79 countries will began dispersing CW7...

12
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:00,460
in the upper layers of the atmosphere.

13
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:07,009
...And surprisingly bring down the
average global temperature...

14
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:09,719
It is just a day away that...

15
00:02:11,222 --> 00:02:12,681
...According to scientists...

16
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:15,850
the artificial cooling subtance CW7...

17
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:20,438
will succeed in bringing average global temperature
down to managable level.

18
00:02:20,606 --> 00:02:24,568
As a revolutionary solution to mankind's
warming of the planet.

19
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:09,236
Soon after dispersing CW7, the world froze.
All life became extinct.

20
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:29,883
The precious few who boarded the rattling ark...

21
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,677
are humanity's last survivors.

22
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:48,569
Bed check.

23
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:54,615
17 years later
A.D 2031.

24
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,659
Alright, get in line.

25
00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:58,575
Everybody sit down.

26
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:02,551
One, two, three...

27
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:06,009
four, five, six...

28
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:07,086
Keep going.

29
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:09,131
Go on.

30
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,332
Hey you, sit down.

31
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,432
Curtis, sit down.

32
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:23,081
Sit down.

33
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,060
I said sit down!

34
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,576
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Counting.

35
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:34,870
Can't you sit and count?
You want to get shot? You're crazy.

36
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,699
Shut up, Edgar. I'm thinking.

37
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:41,038
Are there any experienced violinist here?

38
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:42,497
Raise your hands.

39
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,332
Violinist!

40
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,334
Stand up, come forward.

41
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:48,002
Food, come and get it.

42
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,755
Violinist, they're having a laugh.

43
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,653
Those bastards in the front sections
think they own us.

44
00:04:53,774 --> 00:04:57,389
Eating their steak dinner
and listening to string quarter.

45
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,661
Will be different when we get there.

46
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:02,767
I want steak.

47
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,261
Excuse me, sir.

48
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,569
My wife and I played violin in the
Boston Symphony Orchestra.

49
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:15,113
I was first chair.

50
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:16,824
Can you still play?

51
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,492
Of course, you never forget.

52
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:20,119
Show me your hands.

53
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:25,081
You, follow me.

54
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,584
Leave your belongings,
we just need your hands.

55
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:29,112
Both?

56
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:31,213
Yes, both hands.

57
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:35,134
My wife Doris plays beautifully.
Better than me, even.

58
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,136
They just need one person.

59
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:39,512
Then i won't go.

60
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:42,766
Doris, Doris...

61
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:48,706
Sit down, everyone.

62
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,189
Sit down.

63
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,161
- They can't just...
- Sit down.

64
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,694
Those fucking bastards.

65
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:56,196
Now isn't the time.

66
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:57,697
When is the time?

67
00:05:58,286 --> 00:05:59,324
Soon.

68
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,620
Doris.

69
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,954
I'll be back, Doris.
It's alright.

70
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,583
I'll come back.

71
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:26,143
What does steak taste like again?

72
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,269
I had it once,
but i can't remember.

73
00:06:28,437 --> 00:06:30,434
If you can't remember then it's better
to forget.

74
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:33,608
What does it smell like when it's cooked?

75
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:35,610
It must emminate around the place.

76
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:36,862
Curtis.

77
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:38,659
It's not it.

78
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,151
Sorry.

79
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:42,451
Curtis, here!

80
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,206
Timbo!

81
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,334
How's it hanging, buddy?

82
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:52,213
Give me a pow.

83
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:56,215
Listen.

84
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:58,639
I think i need that protein block.

85
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,319
How about i trade you,
this one for that one?

86
00:07:04,473 --> 00:07:05,473
No.

87
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:08,942
Nice bargaining power, Curtis.
Here, give me this one, i'll give you that...

88
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,187
Relax, relax...

89
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:11,730
Come here, Timmy.

90
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:14,440
Come right...

91
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,110
I have an idea.

92
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:22,898
I'll give you this one and that one
for that one.

93
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,596
- What do you say?
- No.

94
00:07:26,473 --> 00:07:27,663
Go get him.

95
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,312
Timmy!

96
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:36,922
Timothy, your mom is gonna give you
a damn good spanking.

97
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:38,382
Where the fuck he went?

98
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:41,932
Hey, come here.
Give it to me.

99
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:43,870
Hi Jose, how are you doing?

100
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:48,156
Timmy! Work with me here.

101
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:49,768
Edgar, why did you let him
get up there?

102
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:52,103
No i didn't, he got up there by himself.
He's very nimble.

103
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,595
- He's 5.
- He's a very nimble 5 year old.

104
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:57,185
Timmy, sweety come down.

105
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:01,196
Come here.

106
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,281
What do you want for it?

107
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,331
In the whole wide train?

108
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,214
In the whole wide train.

109
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:08,495
The ball.

110
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,516
The ball? No.

111
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:13,007
No, i'm sorry i can't do that.
I can't do that.

112
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:16,836
Yes, the ball for a whole hour.

113
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,082
done.

114
00:08:25,778 --> 00:08:28,331
Curtis. Is it time?

115
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,593
Not yet, Tanya. Soon.

116
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,290
Red paper?

117
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:57,836
Yeah, it's the one we've been
waiting for.

118
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:00,379
Our informant gave us a name.

119
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:05,692
N, A, M...

120
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,638
Nam Koong Min Soo.

121
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:12,238
He's a security expert.
He's in the prison section now.

122
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:15,735
- Wait, you're joking right? He's in prison?
- Out of here.

123
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,956
- I'm just saying, what kind of chance do we have...
- Edgar.

124
00:09:18,076 --> 00:09:22,001
I just think if this guy says
that he's such a great security expert...

125
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,357
- why can't he just break himself?
- That's enough! Go.

126
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:30,494
Let's go, Tim.

127
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:31,995
Come on, let's go.

128
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,480
Edgar just wants to help, you know.

129
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:41,004
He thinks the world of you.

130
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,926
He shouldn't worship me the way he does.
I'm not who he thinks i am.

131
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:49,746
It's you over us.

132
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,014
Alright, we're here.

133
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,692
Tail section, quarantine section,
prison section.

134
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:59,042
Gate, gate, gate.

135
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:02,109
4 seconds when all three gates
are open at once.

136
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:06,702
We have 4 second to go through three gates
and bust Nam out.

137
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:09,990
That Nam gets us the rest of the way.

138
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:14,557
Our fate depends on this man.

139
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah.

140
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:22,879
If we can get him to cooperate
he can take us all the way to the front of the train.

141
00:10:25,383 --> 00:10:27,091
Very front section?

142
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:29,344
Yeah.

143
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,682
From here right through
the front of the train.

144
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,518
Everything in one stroke.

145
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:41,022
We control the engine,
we control the world.

146
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:43,024
Without that,
we have nothing.

147
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:46,783
All past revolutions have failed
because they couldn't take the engine.

148
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:48,488
What are you saying?

149
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,109
This time we take the engine.

150
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:54,721
Then what?

151
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:58,778
We kill them.

152
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:00,207
Wilford?

153
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,580
You should run the train now,
not Wilford.

154
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:13,221
I am a shadow of my former shadow.

155
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,018
My day was decades ago.

156
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,395
How old is Gilliam?

157
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,690
Shut up, Edgar.

158
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:28,235
I'm not saying that i want that to happen,
that's not what i'm saying.

159
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:32,698
What i mean is
he will die someday.

160
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:37,870
And when that happens,
you're gonna have to take over.

161
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,290
You're gonna have to
run the train.

162
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,461
I am not a leader.

163
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:48,380
I don't know.

164
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:52,177
I think you'd be pretty good
if you ask me.

165
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:04,688
Edgar.

166
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:09,068
How far back
can you remember?

167
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:11,988
I do not know, like what?

168
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,990
Your mother, you remember her?

169
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,831
I can remember a face...

170
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,960
every once in a while.

171
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:29,088
But it's not clear.

172
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,932
Stay down, everybody.

173
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:36,650
- Everybody stay in your place.
- Fucking look at me.

174
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:39,596
Keep down, keep down.

175
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:46,313
- Medical inspection. Just the kids.
- All the kids come with me.

176
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:47,991
It's a medical check up.

177
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:49,525
You're doing good.

178
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,070
Everybody, all the kids.

179
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,697
- All the kids?
- You too.
- That's right, just come.

180
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,972
Stay back there, ma'am.
Just stay back there.

181
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:00,912
Alright, one more.

182
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:03,712
Yup, come on.

183
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:05,917
You need to go.

184
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,653
It's just a medical check up.
You just stay back there.

185
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:12,788
Come on, that's right.
Come with the others, okay.

186
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:08,394
You, go and check.

187
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,299
- Don't move.
- Go, Timmy!

188
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,426
Timmy!

189
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:30,594
That's her baby!

190
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,188
Andy!

191
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,634
Give me back my son.

192
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:41,365
Give me my son,
you fucking bitch!

193
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,073
Andy!

194
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:48,644
Let him throw his shoe.

195
00:14:56,792 --> 00:15:00,092
- Timmy!
- Tim!

196
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:29,292
At this altitude, we need only 7 minutes.

197
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:16,307
7 minutes alotted for your speech, sir.

198
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:22,489
This is so dissapointing.

199
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:30,788
We don't need all that,
we only got 7 minutes.

200
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,548
Passengers...

201
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:44,455
This is not a shoe.

202
00:16:44,928 --> 00:16:47,725
This is disorder.

203
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:51,475
This is size 10 chaos.

204
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:55,706
This, you see this?
This is death.

205
00:16:56,398 --> 00:17:00,150
In this locomotive we call home,
there is one thing...

206
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:03,446
that between our warm hearts
and the bitter cold...

207
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:07,567
Clothing? Jeans? No, order.

208
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:12,140
Order is the barrier that holds back
the cold and death.

209
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:15,458
We must all of us,
on this train of life...

210
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,211
remain in our alloted stations...

211
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:21,005
we must each of us occupy...

212
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:25,175
our preordained particulate positions.

213
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,893
Would you wear a shoe on your head?

214
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:36,061
Of course you wouldn't wear
a shoe on your head.

215
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:37,896
A shoe doesn't belong in your head.

216
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:40,894
A shoe belongs on your foot.

217
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:43,616
A hat belongs on your head.

218
00:17:43,737 --> 00:17:46,280
I am a hat,
you are a shoe.

219
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:49,366
I belong on the head,
you belong on the foot.

220
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,929
Yes? So it is.

221
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,874
In the beginning, order was prescribed
by your ticket.

222
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,711
First bus, economy,
and freeloaders like you.

223
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:04,548
Eternal order is prescribed by
the Sacred Engine.

224
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:07,468
All things flow from
the Sacred Engine.

225
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:09,386
All things in their place.

226
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,763
All passengers in their sections.

227
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,517
All water flowing,
all heat rise...

228
00:18:14,684 --> 00:18:17,394
pays homage to
the Sacred Engine.

229
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,772
In its own particulate...

230
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:24,192
preordained positions.

231
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:25,862
So it is.

232
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:29,824
Now, as in the beginning...

233
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,719
I belong to the front.

234
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:37,151
You belong to the tail.

235
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,711
When the foot seeks the place of the head...

236
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:44,380
a sacred line is crossed.

237
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,715
Know your place.

238
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:48,800
Keep your place.

239
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:51,261
Be a shoe.

240
00:18:57,978 --> 00:19:00,771
We have 42 seconds left.

241
00:19:00,897 --> 00:19:04,232
So we can go to comment of Mr. Wilford,

242
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:07,403
the divine keeper of
the Sacred Engine.

243
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:11,465
Sir? Mr. Wilford?

244
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:14,028
Are you there?

245
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:18,351
Are you there, sir?

246
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:25,211
It's breaking up.
Well...

247
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,875
Mr. Wilford's a very busy man.

248
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:29,974
So it is.

249
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,778
We're just gonna watch?

250
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:52,365
- Not now.
- I'm not just gonna fucking sit here.

251
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:28,692
Nah, alright.

252
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,160
Stop, stop right there.
Sit down.

253
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,115
Put that useless gun down.
Put it away.

254
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,499
Long time no see, Mr. Gilliam.

255
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,219
It's a pleasure!

256
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:50,088
You look healthy.

257
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,195
He's fine.

258
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:07,065
Minister Mason, please deliver a mesage to Mr. Wilford.

259
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:08,571
Certainly, what should i say?

260
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:11,828
Tell him he and i need to talk.

261
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:14,905
Well, you can talk to me.

262
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:18,294
Mr. Wilford has no reason to visit here.

263
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,373
Not here.

264
00:21:20,953 --> 00:21:22,462
At the front.

265
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:40,895
Nice to hear it.

266
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:42,849
Your son will be a hero, I promise.

267
00:21:43,143 --> 00:21:44,770
Or daughter, whatever it is.

268
00:21:45,186 --> 00:21:46,708
I got it.

269
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,796
- Your contribution has been dully noted.
- Thanks.

270
00:21:54,824 --> 00:21:56,823
So sorry to interrupt you
while you're praying.

271
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,786
So sorry.

272
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:02,744
There's your Buddha back,
thanks very much.

273
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,773
Move! Move!

274
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:12,242
Stop fooling around.

275
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,784
I've got a better batch.

276
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:45,126
Stronger, fresh, uncut.

277
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,037
Want to try some?

278
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:51,548
How many protein blocks for
10 rocks of uncut Kronol?

279
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:01,910
They don't have bullets.

280
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:04,097
Why do you say that?

281
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:08,978
You remember what Mason said?
She said, "Put down that useless gun".

282
00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:11,148
She meant...

283
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,857
she wouldn't give the order
to shoot me.

284
00:23:14,368 --> 00:23:15,462
No.

285
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:18,813
No, i think the guns
are literally useless.

286
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,657
They've used up al their bullets
4 years ago on the last revolt.

287
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,621
Bullets are extinct.

288
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:31,996
If you're wrong, we could be finish
before we even start.

289
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,545
I think we should be patient.

290
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,839
Wait for the next red letter.

291
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,614
To the left.

292
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:57,406
And right.

293
00:23:57,527 --> 00:24:00,067
Not yet, up.
Now left.

294
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,169
Good, good.

295
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:06,304
1...2...1...2...

296
00:24:06,423 --> 00:24:09,660
1...2...1...2...

297
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:19,244
Hello? Andrew.

298
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:21,076
Andrew!

299
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,934
Wake up.
Rise and shine.

300
00:24:25,055 --> 00:24:28,808
When you dream to much of the sun,
you forget the trees.

301
00:24:30,394 --> 00:24:32,932
I believe this is your son.

302
00:24:33,268 --> 00:24:38,003
I'm sorry, it's not very good.

303
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:41,326
It's not my best work,
it's a little dark.

304
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:45,490
If you look very deep into the eyes,
you can see a little bit of hope.

305
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,243
What about my boy? You got one of Timmy?

306
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:50,088
Yes, Tanya.
I do.

307
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:53,290
Easy, easy.
Don't hurt yourself.

308
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,624
Here, there you go, Timmy.

309
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,436
Look at him.

310
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,178
One little smile.

311
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,023
Curtis, you gotta let me come with you.

312
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:19,692
No, Tanya, I'm sorry.

313
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:21,861
You will be if you don't let me come.

314
00:25:22,612 --> 00:25:25,614
I'm going to the front and i'm gonna make
that bitch sorry she put a hand on my boy.

315
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:27,032
Make this one tighter.

316
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:31,619
You know i'm stronger than all these
skinny ass soldiers anyway.

317
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:35,915
Please.

318
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:40,880
Shit, what's going on?

319
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,839
Change of schedule, boys.
Come to back.

320
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,175
It's now or never.

321
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:47,714
Don't panic.
Stick with the plan.

322
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,727
Hide that, hide your weapons
in your clothes.

323
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,163
- Head check.
- Yeah.

324
00:26:00,317 --> 00:26:01,624
Line up.

325
00:26:06,655 --> 00:26:08,151
Alright, sit down.

326
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,051
1...2...3...

327
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,884
What the fuck do we do?

328
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:17,631
6...Keep going.

329
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,835
I've had enough of this
protein block bullshit.

330
00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:21,336
Yeah, this is bullshit.

331
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:23,886
- I'm hungry.
- I want chicken.

332
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:25,997
We're not gonna sit down
for this shit.

333
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,707
We want chicken!
Chicken!

334
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,106
Quiet! Be quiet!

335
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,233
Calm down.
It's okay.

336
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:39,438
You want him dead?
Is that it?

337
00:26:39,605 --> 00:26:40,940
Keep quiet.

338
00:26:41,982 --> 00:26:44,076
Still going for it, are we?

339
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:49,192
Come on, let's go!
Let's do it.

340
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:56,372
The rifles.

341
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:57,957
No, we can get them.

342
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,291
We're easily outnumbered their bullets.

343
00:27:05,589 --> 00:27:06,923
This is it.

344
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:08,968
Curtis, come on.

345
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,595
We're out of time,
we gotta do it now.

346
00:27:23,907 --> 00:27:28,304
They've got no bullets!
They've got no bullets!

347
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,865
Keep going, keep going!

348
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:58,847
Close the gate quick.
Shut it.

349
00:28:46,482 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm fine, Grey. You go now.

350
00:29:14,301 --> 00:29:15,301
Fuck.

351
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:19,818
Nam Koong Min Soo. Kronol addict.
That explains a lot, doesn't it?

352
00:29:19,939 --> 00:29:21,849
- Hurry up, Edgar.
- Hurry up?

353
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,146
So sorry for keeping you all waiting.

354
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:28,065
Obviously i work here so...

355
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:33,153
- Open it.
- Here we go.

356
00:29:49,546 --> 00:29:51,086
Kronol head...

357
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:56,641
So this is Kronol?
I hear it's pretty big in the front section.

358
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,971
Careful, that's how these guys
hallucinate.

359
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:01,222
It's industrial waste.

360
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,403
And it's highly flammable.

361
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:27,753
Are you Nam Koong Min Soo, security specialist?

362
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:34,548
Did you design all the door locks
and the security systems on the train?

363
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:37,550
Look at him man, he's gone.
Look at his eyes.

364
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,845
He's fried his brain
with that fucking shit.

365
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:42,162
Are you Nam?

366
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:03,076
Nam, are you listening?

367
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:11,001
Yes, I'm listening, bastard.

368
00:31:12,387 --> 00:31:17,048
My name is not "Nem", it is "Nam".
Namgoung Minsoo, shit.

369
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:21,601
Namgoung is my name, my surname is Minsoo, asshole.

370
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:23,734
Unknown words.

371
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:26,683
Try again with the correct vocabulary.

372
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,644
We need your help.

373
00:31:29,895 --> 00:31:31,230
For what?

374
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:34,148
We're going to the front.

375
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:36,652
And we need you to open up the gates.

376
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:40,239
If i don't want to?

377
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:44,159
Uncut, straight from the barrel.

378
00:31:44,557 --> 00:31:48,079
Every door you open,
you get one lap of Kronol.

379
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:06,192
Jesus, Marlboro Light?

380
00:32:08,434 --> 00:32:09,852
I can't believe it.

381
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:13,313
Cigarettes have been extinct for more
than 10 years now.

382
00:32:23,282 --> 00:32:25,491
You want a smoke too, asshole?

383
00:32:26,536 --> 00:32:31,022
It's too good for shit like you.

384
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,167
I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

385
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:36,252
You help us, you get your drug.

386
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,963
If not, we put you back
where we found you.

387
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:40,840
What'll be, asshole?

388
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:49,724
Chan.

389
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,810
Chan, get out of here.
Let's get out.

390
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:17,865
That's enough.

391
00:33:19,588 --> 00:33:22,048
I'll put you back in the drawer.

392
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:42,291
Get up.

393
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:55,146
My daughter, Yona.
To move forward, we need her.

394
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:58,125
So you're coming with us?

395
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:04,376
For each door, I want two blocks of Kronol.

396
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:08,815
She's an addict too?

397
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:35,641
Nobody there.

398
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,088
Kronol?

399
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:03,442
Look at all these beds. Where is everybody?

400
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,443
Looks like they left in a hurry.

401
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,925
There's food on the table.

402
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:16,454
This can't be a window, can it?

403
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:36,619
Still cold.

404
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:48,666
Dead.

405
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:52,927
All dead.

406
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:09,925
Alright, let's go everyone. Stay focus.
We didn't come here for this.

407
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,677
You heard the man, let's go.
Move.

408
00:36:11,844 --> 00:36:13,641
Nehm...Nam!

409
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:19,559
Kronol!

410
00:36:20,143 --> 00:36:22,061
How did you know
there was nobody there?

411
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,061
He's running.

412
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:36,586
Paul?

413
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,132
Paul!

414
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,021
What is he doing?

415
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:42,353
He looks so different.

416
00:36:42,474 --> 00:36:43,500
Just a second.

417
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:47,063
It's used to be automatic,
but it's hard when it extinct.

418
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,943
- It's not the Paul i remember.
- No.

419
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:51,925
Paul? It's Curtis!

420
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,958
They ain't coming back,
so now i gotta do it.

421
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:58,315
Manually.

422
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,809
So that's how it's made.

423
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:04,007
Still hot.

424
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,414
Look at them all.

425
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:08,190
You do some nice work.

426
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:11,152
That's right man, that's your food.
That's your protein block.

427
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,262
Is this why they took you?
To make this garbage?

428
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:16,731
Paul?

429
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,327
You've been alone
this whole time?

430
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,204
Alone.

431
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:25,103
In the zone.

432
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:30,092
We're going to the front.
Come with us.

433
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:32,257
Alright, you're going to the front?
Yeah.

434
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:35,969
But no way, my place is here alright?

435
00:37:36,094 --> 00:37:38,974
Here? Making this crap? Why?

436
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:04,853
- You can't draw this.
- Okay.

437
00:38:09,336 --> 00:38:10,547
Oh man.

438
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,215
All this time, we've been eating this shit?

439
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,300
I eat them too, you know?

440
00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:17,219
Every single day.

441
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:21,847
Where'd you get this?

442
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:25,309
Have you been the one
writing this?

443
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:27,771
I don't write them...

444
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,606
Why do you have this?
Who gave this to you?

445
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,699
They just leave them for me.

446
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,327
I put them in the protein block,
i stamp them on.

447
00:38:37,447 --> 00:38:38,447
That's it.

448
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:44,121
The water supply section?

449
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,498
Yes, just a few carts up.

450
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:50,460
It's where the water's cleansed
and recycled.

451
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,295
It's one of the most crucial sections
in the train.

452
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,050
If we take it,
we'll have the upperhand?

453
00:38:57,385 --> 00:38:59,844
We don't even have to go
to the very front.

454
00:39:00,387 --> 00:39:02,304
We control the water...

455
00:39:02,849 --> 00:39:04,932
we control the negotiation.

456
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:16,148
Excuse me, sorry to bother you there,
could i get you a glass of water to speed this up?

457
00:39:19,322 --> 00:39:22,492
Would you get on with it, man?
You're keeping us all waiting.

458
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:24,869
Is it my fault?

459
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:26,121
You, you are.

460
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:29,331
Although you've been fucking smelling that thing that...

461
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,989
time is a probably a distant concept
for you, isn't it?

462
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,423
Of course, I do it for the Kronol.

463
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:40,427
Here we go again. Kronol this,
Kronol that...

464
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:43,554
Christ almighty man,
do some work.

465
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:46,099
You're the one who's giving me this.

466
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:49,818
Are you thick? That's what you asked for
each time you opened the gate.

467
00:39:56,902 --> 00:39:59,206
Yona? It's Yona right?

468
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:02,797
How old are you?

469
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,661
17.

470
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:09,706
17, you're a train baby then?

471
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:13,422
How about you?

472
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:16,922
17 years on earth.

473
00:40:17,978 --> 00:40:20,050
17 years in the tail section.

474
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:21,847
Earth?

475
00:40:22,677 --> 00:40:24,137
What was it like?

476
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:26,014
I don't remember.

477
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:27,840
Why?

478
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:32,204
I don't want to remember anything
before i met Gilliam.

479
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:37,692
Yona.

480
00:40:39,445 --> 00:40:40,653
Are you clarevouyant?

481
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:43,989
Clarevouyant? What's that?

482
00:40:44,282 --> 00:40:47,911
You always seem to know
what's behind the gates.

483
00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:50,288
Do you see things
in your mind?

484
00:41:06,472 --> 00:41:07,806
Don't open it.

485
00:41:08,556 --> 00:41:09,682
What?

486
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,530
Stop!

487
00:42:52,452 --> 00:42:53,875
Be careful.

488
00:42:56,831 --> 00:42:57,985
You too.

489
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:27,302
Team 2, move.

490
00:43:27,422 --> 00:43:28,807
Move forward!

491
00:45:30,735 --> 00:45:33,693
We're passing Yekaterina bridge!

492
00:45:38,327 --> 00:45:40,333
We're at the bridge, guys!

493
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:43,434
10...9...8...7...

494
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:49,586
5...4...3...2...1.

495
00:45:52,298 --> 00:45:54,135
Happy new year!

496
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:56,641
Happy new year!

497
00:45:56,762 --> 00:45:59,496
I hate getting old, i hate it.

498
00:46:07,273 --> 00:46:09,320
Everybody down!

499
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,853
Hang on.

500
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:21,418
Impact!

501
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:29,293
Not yet. A second one.

502
00:46:30,045 --> 00:46:32,266
Stay down.

503
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:49,445
Nam, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

504
00:46:49,565 --> 00:46:51,742
He's high as a fucking kite.

505
00:46:58,157 --> 00:46:59,722
We're getting closer.

506
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,606
Safe passage.

507
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,338
One, two. One, two.

508
00:47:58,092 --> 00:48:02,610
Happy Yekaterina bridge, you filthy engraged.

509
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:08,309
You people, who if not for the benivolent Wilford...

510
00:48:08,476 --> 00:48:12,643
would have frozen solid 18 years ago today...

511
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:15,822
You people...

512
00:48:15,943 --> 00:48:20,112
who would suck up the generous titties
of Wilford ever since...

513
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,364
for food and shelter.

514
00:48:23,221 --> 00:48:24,574
And now,

515
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:30,842
in front of our hallowed water supplies section no less...

516
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,849
you repay his kindness...

517
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:36,806
with violent hooliganism.

518
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:41,358
You scum.

519
00:48:45,931 --> 00:48:48,807
Precisely 74% of you shall die.

520
00:48:55,231 --> 00:48:59,860
My friend, you suffer from a misplaced optimism
of the doom.

521
00:49:00,695 --> 00:49:02,583
This is going to be good.

522
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:13,458
What? What did he say?

523
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,860
He said you guys are fucked.

524
00:49:17,713 --> 00:49:19,945
You should beat those sectioners.

525
00:49:22,842 --> 00:49:24,974
There's a tunnel right after Yekaterina...

526
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:26,179
A tunnel?

527
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:27,722
A fucking long one.

528
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:29,773
What are you doing? Run.

529
00:49:33,561 --> 00:49:35,576
Everybody down!

530
00:49:35,695 --> 00:49:37,746
Go, go, go!

531
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,838
Chan, get out, get out.

532
00:50:55,393 --> 00:50:58,068
Chan! We need fire!

533
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,329
Chan, bring the fire.

534
00:51:00,449 --> 00:51:03,568
Throw them in the back, we're gonna get the lights here.

535
00:51:03,735 --> 00:51:05,634
Chan, the matches.

536
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:38,081
We will crush you, motherfuckers!

537
00:51:39,326 --> 00:51:41,313
Officer Fuyu!

538
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:46,121
What are you doing? Don't look at me.
Get them.

539
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:01,440
Put me down, stop squeezing my leg.

540
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:21,798
Surrender!
Surrender!

541
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:26,822
Surrender, he'll kill me
if we don't surrender.

542
00:52:29,695 --> 00:52:31,050
Sure.

543
00:52:57,306 --> 00:52:59,175
Curtis!

544
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:51,246
Stop!

545
00:53:51,737 --> 00:53:54,952
Stop everybody!

546
00:53:55,072 --> 00:53:56,985
Drop your weapons!

547
00:54:00,911 --> 00:54:02,168
Stop!

548
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:03,958
Everybody stop!

549
00:54:09,963 --> 00:54:13,568
Do what he says, for crying out loud.

550
00:54:15,969 --> 00:54:17,963
Drop your weapons!

551
00:55:17,989 --> 00:55:19,518
Don't look.

552
00:56:00,114 --> 00:56:01,614
Survivors.

553
00:56:03,242 --> 00:56:05,302
Wash yourselves.

554
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:10,039
The water supplies section...

555
00:56:13,128 --> 00:56:14,878
Wash away the blood.

556
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,742
Have you seen these kids?

557
00:56:46,661 --> 00:56:48,740
I don't know anything about...

558
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,300
Where are they, you bitch?

559
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:59,594
I don't know, it's not me.

560
00:57:00,675 --> 00:57:04,219
Tell us or we'll cut your arm
you bastard.

561
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,523
Wilford knows.

562
00:57:08,036 --> 00:57:10,559
Wilford likes kids.

563
00:57:11,311 --> 00:57:12,186
He does.

564
00:57:12,353 --> 00:57:16,148
That's why he sent that yellow worm cloth
to get them for him.

565
00:57:16,483 --> 00:57:18,621
It's Wilford you want,
not me!

566
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:20,985
Wilford likes kids?

567
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:24,184
All he cares about is
his rachet engine.

568
00:57:24,304 --> 00:57:26,407
The engine is sacred.

569
00:57:26,701 --> 00:57:29,036
And Wilford is divine.

570
00:57:29,454 --> 00:57:31,914
Wilford is merciful.

571
00:57:34,793 --> 00:57:36,126
Call him.

572
00:57:37,461 --> 00:57:39,170
See if he'll come save you.

573
00:57:39,297 --> 00:57:40,505
Yes.

574
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:44,050
Wilford the merciful.

575
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:45,219
Call him.

576
00:57:46,221 --> 00:57:49,980
He won't come here,
he won't leave his engine.

577
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:54,094
We're gonna rip you into little pieces,
he still won't come?

578
00:57:57,648 --> 00:58:01,360
When we control the water and turn that off,
he'll have to come.

579
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:03,403
Turn off the water?

580
00:58:04,905 --> 00:58:07,699
You'll only be condemning
your own people.

581
00:58:08,576 --> 00:58:10,452
The water come from the front.

582
00:58:10,996 --> 00:58:15,614
The nose of the train, it breaks up the snow and ice
and turns it into water.

583
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:17,963
Like an elephant's trunk.

584
00:58:18,378 --> 00:58:20,128
The water comes in the mouth.

585
00:58:20,255 --> 00:58:22,878
Not in the bum, Curtis.

586
00:58:23,532 --> 00:58:27,969
Yes, Wilford knows you well, Mr Curtis Everett.

587
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:29,804
He's been watching you.

588
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:33,733
And we know you won't harm
your own people.

589
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:39,653
Too bad you couldn't save your second in command,
what was his name? Edgar?

590
00:58:39,773 --> 00:58:40,967
Shut the fuck up!

591
00:58:41,088 --> 00:58:42,657
Mr Curtis, I can help you.

592
00:58:42,777 --> 00:58:44,695
You can fucking die, is what you can do.

593
00:58:44,862 --> 00:58:47,072
No, i can help you.
I swear it.

594
00:58:47,282 --> 00:58:48,871
Listen to me.

595
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:51,666
Wilford won't come here.
He's not coming.

596
00:58:51,786 --> 00:58:53,454
You've got to go to him.

597
00:58:53,621 --> 00:58:55,289
And i can take you.

598
00:58:55,456 --> 00:58:58,672
I know the train, i can guarantee you safe passage.

599
00:58:58,793 --> 00:59:00,710
Why would i trust you?

600
00:59:03,297 --> 00:59:04,922
Because I want to live.

601
00:59:06,675 --> 00:59:09,052
So you'd sell out Wilford the Benevolent?

602
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:12,405
If i take you to the front...

603
00:59:13,557 --> 00:59:14,931
you have to kill him.

604
00:59:15,434 --> 00:59:16,923
I'll get you close enough.

605
00:59:17,269 --> 00:59:20,396
You kill him and let me live.

606
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,864
Curtis?

607
00:59:37,331 --> 00:59:40,000
You still determined to push ahead?

608
00:59:41,085 --> 00:59:42,293
Of course.

609
00:59:42,961 --> 00:59:44,715
We're not even half way.

610
00:59:47,175 --> 00:59:50,324
You already go further than
anyone else.

611
00:59:52,514 --> 00:59:55,268
Rather than McGregor, 4 years ago.

612
00:59:56,643 --> 01:00:00,684
10 cars, 20 cars, it doesn't matter
unless you make it to the engine.

613
01:00:01,188 --> 01:00:05,317
They'll just regroup and attack us again.
We gotta pull them up at the routes.

614
01:00:06,193 --> 01:00:08,612
So many have been killed.

615
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:12,606
We've lost so many.

616
01:00:13,827 --> 01:00:14,873
I know.

617
01:00:14,994 --> 01:00:16,869
You seen our men?

618
01:00:17,496 --> 01:00:19,101
They are exhausted.

619
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:22,626
I told them to wash themselves...

620
01:00:23,836 --> 01:00:26,045
so i can asess the damage.

621
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,288
Let me go ahead.

622
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:01,036
I got Mason now,
i can move a lot faster.

623
01:01:01,498 --> 01:01:04,168
You stay here with the wounded
and guard the prisoners.

624
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:07,670
Let me take the Engine,
i'll call for you to lead us.

625
01:01:09,257 --> 01:01:10,882
Stop it, Curtis.

626
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,335
Why are you doing that?

627
01:01:15,429 --> 01:01:19,974
You know very well that you're already
our leader.

628
01:01:21,643 --> 01:01:24,045
You have to accept that.

629
01:01:30,027 --> 01:01:32,523
How can i lead if i have
two good arms.

630
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,358
It's faded out.

631
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,311
Better to have both arms...

632
01:02:06,146 --> 01:02:08,898
You can't do a lot with one, you know?

633
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:11,860
Especially when you hold a woman.

634
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:14,969
Much better to have two arms,
won't you agree?

635
01:02:24,081 --> 01:02:26,500
Well you get to the narrow bridge...

636
01:02:27,418 --> 01:02:29,545
big gate with a W on it.

637
01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,048
Wilford's behind that.

638
01:02:36,802 --> 01:02:38,762
Don't let Wilford talk.

639
01:02:41,474 --> 01:02:43,016
Cut out his tounge.

640
01:02:46,103 --> 01:02:48,824
Okay, let's all get in there.
Squeeze in.

641
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:55,076
Perfect, perfect.

642
01:02:55,195 --> 01:02:56,987
The hat becomes you well.

643
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:00,677
Now Grey...

644
01:03:03,121 --> 01:03:05,378
You must go with Curtis.

645
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,047
Forgot somebody.

646
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,472
Okay.

647
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:28,144
Kronol.

648
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:58,257
Don't mind me, back to work everyone.
Back to work.

649
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:01,010
Minister, are you okay?

650
01:04:01,179 --> 01:04:02,012
I'm okay.

651
01:04:02,179 --> 01:04:03,304
Please don't eat it...

652
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,974
They're very friendly,
they won't bite.

653
01:04:06,141 --> 01:04:08,351
They might bite a tomato.

654
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:14,358
You can eat this too?

655
01:04:14,525 --> 01:04:17,943
A train baby wouldn't know about this.

656
01:04:18,112 --> 01:04:19,987
I grew up walking over it.

657
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:22,990
This is located under the snow.

658
01:04:23,201 --> 01:04:24,201
Of the earth.

659
01:04:24,952 --> 01:04:26,369
What is this?

660
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:28,246
It moves.

661
01:04:28,623 --> 01:04:30,206
Underground.

662
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:32,793
What does this mean?

663
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,570
Do any of you feel like sushi?

664
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:04,282
Hell yeah...

665
01:05:04,617 --> 01:05:05,974
Right?

666
01:05:10,164 --> 01:05:11,847
You people are very lucky.

667
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:15,085
This is only served twice in a year.

668
01:05:15,253 --> 01:05:17,407
In January and July.

669
01:05:17,755 --> 01:05:19,880
Why? Not enough fish?

670
01:05:20,048 --> 01:05:22,259
Enough is not the criteria.

671
01:05:23,094 --> 01:05:24,177
Balance.

672
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:28,514
This aquarium is complete ecological system.

673
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:32,351
And the number of individual units...

674
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:35,731
must be very closely, precisely controlled.

675
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:39,824
In order to maintain the proper
sustainable balance.

676
01:06:21,342 --> 01:06:24,570
No, you eat this.

677
01:06:25,405 --> 01:06:27,032
You know what that's made of?

678
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:36,505
Dig in.

679
01:07:00,106 --> 01:07:02,384
Curtis, my friend, do you think that we might...

680
01:07:02,503 --> 01:07:05,228
dispense for the restrain
for this next section?

681
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:07,989
I'm not your friend. And why would i?

682
01:07:08,436 --> 01:07:10,367
For the sake of the young?

683
01:07:10,867 --> 01:07:12,139
Education?

684
01:07:15,289 --> 01:07:16,539
Quiet!

685
01:07:16,706 --> 01:07:18,625
Good morning, children.

686
01:07:18,793 --> 01:07:22,378
I'm pleased to present guests
from tail section.

687
01:07:22,547 --> 01:07:25,715
Yes, what do we say to
tail section guests, children?

688
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:29,552
Hello, tail section guests.

689
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:30,815
Timmy!

690
01:07:32,769 --> 01:07:34,010
Andy!

691
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:36,034
Andy?

692
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:40,981
This little boy...

693
01:07:41,648 --> 01:07:42,780
His name is Timmy.

694
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,108
This is my son.

695
01:07:44,443 --> 01:07:45,943
Please take a good look at the picture.

696
01:07:46,112 --> 01:07:46,951
I saw them.

697
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,461
- When?
- Where?

698
01:07:48,822 --> 01:07:51,074
Came through there, went through there.

699
01:07:52,076 --> 01:07:53,742
Is that all, boy?

700
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:55,293
Yes.

701
01:07:57,831 --> 01:08:01,284
- Were they crying?
- No, but they looked like they wanted to.

702
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,503
I heard Old Tail Sectioners...

703
01:08:04,672 --> 01:08:07,889
were lazy dogs and they all drink
their own shit.

704
01:08:08,009 --> 01:08:10,635
No, they're very nice.

705
01:08:10,802 --> 01:08:13,554
Very jost and merciful.

706
01:08:13,681 --> 01:08:14,889
So it is.

707
01:08:15,056 --> 01:08:18,643
Minister Mason, we were just about to show
a video.

708
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:19,810
Very good.

709
01:08:23,077 --> 01:08:25,520
Wilford!

710
01:08:26,777 --> 01:08:30,447
From a very young age, Mr. Wilford's love
of locomotive was apparent.

711
01:08:30,614 --> 01:08:34,367
When I grow up, i'll live on a train forever.

712
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:36,208
Forever!

713
01:08:36,328 --> 01:08:37,931
His early dreams were realized...

714
01:08:38,051 --> 01:08:41,255
when he founded his transportation empire...

715
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:43,591
the Wilford Industries.

716
01:08:43,711 --> 01:08:45,837
But his greatest dream was to construct...

717
01:08:45,962 --> 01:08:48,095
a luxury locomotive cruiseline...

718
01:08:48,215 --> 01:08:52,140
connecting railways of the entire world
into one.

719
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:56,671
A circular railway that expands for
438,000 km...

720
01:08:56,792 --> 01:08:59,439
and completes one circle every year.

721
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:03,903
In the exreme cold of the Artic,
and the scorching heat of the African desert...

722
01:09:04,023 --> 01:09:06,483
Wildford's train is self-sustained...

723
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:09,324
possesses the most sophisticated design...

724
01:09:09,444 --> 01:09:10,904
advance technology...

725
01:09:11,029 --> 01:09:13,030
As hard as it is to believe...

726
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:16,395
people in the old world
made fun of Mr Wildford.

727
01:09:16,515 --> 01:09:18,787
They critized him for overengineering...

728
01:09:18,912 --> 01:09:21,962
and overequipping this
wonderful train.

729
01:09:22,082 --> 01:09:25,042
But Mr Wilford knew
something they did not.

730
01:09:25,211 --> 01:09:26,175
And what was that?

731
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:30,590
All world people are frigging morons
who got turned into popsicles.

732
01:09:30,757 --> 01:09:32,307
Sort of.

733
01:09:32,427 --> 01:09:36,261
Mr. Wilford knew that CW7 would freeze the world.

734
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:40,057
So what did the profetic Mr Wilford invented?

735
01:09:40,225 --> 01:09:42,310
To protect the chosen
from that calamity?

736
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,484
The Engine!

737
01:09:44,604 --> 01:09:46,981
Rumble rumble,
rattle rattle...

738
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:49,759
it will never die!

739
01:09:53,363 --> 01:09:55,514
What happens if the engine stops?

740
01:09:55,634 --> 01:09:57,497
We'd all freeze and die.

741
01:09:57,618 --> 01:09:59,868
But will it stop,
will it stop?

742
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:01,042
No! No!

743
01:10:01,162 --> 01:10:02,913
Can you tell us why?

744
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:07,591
The Engine is eternal,
the Engine is forever...

745
01:10:07,712 --> 01:10:09,886
Rumble rumble,
rattle rattle...

746
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:12,179
who is the reason why?

747
01:10:12,298 --> 01:10:16,304
Wilford!
Yeah!

748
01:10:16,423 --> 01:10:19,149
Wilford Wilford,
hip hurray!

749
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:22,641
I love that one,
such a tonic.

750
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:25,740
It's time children,
come this way.

751
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,320
Don't trip now.

752
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,967
Don't push, there's plenty of room.

753
01:10:31,087 --> 01:10:33,319
Who can tell me
what's coming up?

754
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:36,328
Those of 7.

755
01:10:36,448 --> 01:10:39,908
Pay attention, this tablo
will surely on the exam.

756
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:42,912
15 years ago, in the third year
of the train...

757
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,789
7 passengers tried to stop...

758
01:10:45,957 --> 01:10:48,877
Wilford's miracle train
and go outside...

759
01:10:49,086 --> 01:10:51,003
and what do we call this event, Magdalena?

760
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:53,006
The Revolt of the Seven.

761
01:10:53,131 --> 01:10:55,632
Very good, long before you were born.

762
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:57,844
Of course they failed to stop the train.

763
01:10:58,011 --> 01:11:00,764
Instead they jumped out of the running train.

764
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,222
Here they come now.

765
01:11:04,018 --> 01:11:07,277
Look, you see that?

766
01:11:08,773 --> 01:11:09,730
What?

767
01:11:10,274 --> 01:11:13,122
There they are, that's how far they made it.

768
01:11:18,114 --> 01:11:20,658
You see that woman before?

769
01:11:22,286 --> 01:11:25,162
She was the maid in the lead car.

770
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:28,207
An Inuit.

771
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,335
An Eskimo, actually.

772
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:34,380
She knew all about the ice and snow.

773
01:11:34,798 --> 01:11:37,050
She believed she can survive outside.

774
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,594
If we ever go outside the train?

775
01:11:39,804 --> 01:11:42,811
We'd all freeze and die.

776
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,849
If the engine stops running?

777
01:11:45,016 --> 01:11:47,692
We'd all die.

778
01:11:47,811 --> 01:11:50,860
And who takes care
of the Sacred Engine?

779
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:53,694
Mr. Wilford.

780
01:11:54,527 --> 01:11:57,810
Children, it's the new year eggs
from Mr Wilford.

781
01:11:58,322 --> 01:12:00,405
Touch them, they are still warm.

782
01:12:00,573 --> 01:12:02,783
These eggs are boiled using water...

783
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:05,442
heated by the Sacred Engine itself.

784
01:12:05,561 --> 01:12:07,956
As a special treat,
we have playing for us...

785
01:12:08,082 --> 01:12:12,716
the world's reknowned first chair violinist
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra,

786
01:12:12,837 --> 01:12:15,230
Mr. Gerald McInster.

787
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,176
Is that really Gerald?

788
01:12:21,345 --> 01:12:22,886
He looks damn great.

789
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:24,930
Happy new year.

790
01:12:29,395 --> 01:12:30,811
No, thank you.

791
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:40,471
Let's go Curtis.

792
01:12:47,872 --> 01:12:49,122
Happy new year.

793
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:02,439
I thought the chickens were extinct.

794
01:13:14,711 --> 01:13:17,932
There are actually many things on board
that were rumored to be extinct.

795
01:13:18,052 --> 01:13:19,146
Such as?

796
01:13:21,974 --> 01:13:23,213
This.

797
01:13:40,925 --> 01:13:42,846
Andrew!
No!

798
01:13:56,606 --> 01:13:58,695
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.

799
01:14:08,037 --> 01:14:09,327
No.

800
01:14:34,185 --> 01:14:35,060
Curtis.

801
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:38,480
You have to lead us.

802
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,586
Curtis, my friend, we understand each other...

803
01:14:53,706 --> 01:14:55,868
listen to my words,
it wasn't me.

804
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:15,600
We go forward.

805
01:15:27,613 --> 01:15:28,573
Open!

806
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:29,740
Quickly!

807
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:21,876
It's Mason.

808
01:16:22,043 --> 01:16:23,810
Shit, check her pulse.

809
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:51,287
Hey, don't do...

810
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:01,975
That does not look good.

811
01:18:19,536 --> 01:18:20,610
It happened.

812
01:18:34,926 --> 01:18:36,520
You've got the master key right?

813
01:18:40,474 --> 01:18:42,476
Wait, don't shoot.
Please don't shoot.

814
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:21,417
You've just killed a front section passenger...

815
01:19:24,768 --> 01:19:26,453
I didn't see a thing.

816
01:19:27,479 --> 01:19:29,771
Where are you going? Wait a minute!

817
01:19:30,046 --> 01:19:32,145
Could we talk about it
just one second?

818
01:20:04,725 --> 01:20:06,386
Son of a bitch!

819
01:21:34,939 --> 01:21:36,542
Close the door.

820
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:43,047
Tanya.

821
01:22:51,349 --> 01:22:52,349
My Timmy.

822
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,070
My Timmy...

823
01:23:15,289 --> 01:23:16,748
We're gonna find him.

824
01:23:17,059 --> 01:23:18,462
I promise.

825
01:23:20,837 --> 01:23:22,091
I know.

826
01:23:28,052 --> 01:23:29,520
Thank you.

827
01:24:30,948 --> 01:24:32,484
Take this.

828
01:24:42,002 --> 01:24:44,627
Come on, motherfucker.
You got my Kronol.

829
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:46,430
I want that shit.

830
01:24:48,257 --> 01:24:51,082
I want my Kronol back.

831
01:24:51,703 --> 01:24:53,509
That's my Kronol.

832
01:24:58,395 --> 01:25:01,384
I swear man, i'm gonna kill you.

833
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:47,960
Opens the door.

834
01:26:52,131 --> 01:26:54,332
Kronol first!

835
01:26:55,681 --> 01:26:57,511
You want Kronol?
Here.

836
01:26:57,845 --> 01:26:58,748
Take it.

837
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:01,931
Open it!
Open the gate!

838
01:27:06,563 --> 01:27:08,984
Are you looking for some trouble
or something?

839
01:27:35,884 --> 01:27:38,875
You got a problem with the gates?

840
01:27:42,599 --> 01:27:44,364
Here, smoke a cigarette.

841
01:28:03,828 --> 01:28:06,185
It is a great honor for you.

842
01:28:06,997 --> 01:28:10,381
This is the last cigarette of humanity.

843
01:28:10,502 --> 01:28:12,375
Go enjoy it.

844
01:28:16,423 --> 01:28:18,632
You've ever been to the tail section?

845
01:28:21,528 --> 01:28:23,643
Do you have any idea
what went on back there?

846
01:28:24,015 --> 01:28:25,595
When we boarded?

847
01:28:30,979 --> 01:28:32,564
It was chaos.

848
01:28:36,069 --> 01:28:37,729
We didn't freeze to death.

849
01:28:37,849 --> 01:28:40,113
But we didn't have time to be thankful.

850
01:28:40,618 --> 01:28:43,367
Wilford's soldiers came
and they took everything.

851
01:28:45,036 --> 01:28:47,203
It was thousand people
in iron box...

852
01:28:47,372 --> 01:28:49,494
no food, no water.

853
01:28:58,091 --> 01:29:00,509
After a month,
we ate the weak.

854
01:29:14,189 --> 01:29:16,399
You know what i hate about myself?

855
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:23,158
I know what people taste like.

856
01:29:28,829 --> 01:29:31,038
I know that babies taste best.

857
01:29:45,137 --> 01:29:46,734
There was a woman.

858
01:29:48,725 --> 01:29:50,850
She was hiding with her baby.

859
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:55,730
And some men with knives came.

860
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:01,987
They killed her and took the baby.

861
01:30:05,742 --> 01:30:07,283
And then an old man...

862
01:30:09,244 --> 01:30:10,747
no relations, just...

863
01:30:11,622 --> 01:30:12,956
an old man.

864
01:30:13,457 --> 01:30:15,430
He stepped forward
and he said...

865
01:30:17,002 --> 01:30:18,462
"Give me the knife."

866
01:30:20,088 --> 01:30:22,632
Everyone thought he'd killed the baby himself...

867
01:30:23,967 --> 01:30:25,426
But he took the knife...

868
01:30:28,555 --> 01:30:30,224
and he cut out his own arm...

869
01:30:33,144 --> 01:30:34,810
and he said,
"eat this".

870
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:36,581
"If you're so hungry..."

871
01:30:38,815 --> 01:30:41,944
"eat this, just leave the baby".

872
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:49,201
I had never seen anything like that.

873
01:30:53,706 --> 01:30:55,791
And the men put down their knives.

874
01:31:00,505 --> 01:31:02,838
You probably guessed who that old man was.

875
01:31:07,886 --> 01:31:09,680
That baby was Edgar.

876
01:31:14,851 --> 01:31:16,728
And i was the man with the knife.

877
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:26,445
I killed Edgar's mother.

878
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:42,925
And then one by one,
other people in the tail section started...

879
01:31:43,417 --> 01:31:46,550
cutting arms and legs and offering them.

880
01:31:48,511 --> 01:31:49,927
It was like a miracle.

881
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:58,567
I wanted to...

882
01:31:59,104 --> 01:32:00,453
I tried.

883
01:32:13,444 --> 01:32:17,456
A month later, Wilford's soldiers brought those
protein blocks.

884
01:32:17,707 --> 01:32:19,832
We've been eating that shit ever since.

885
01:32:24,671 --> 01:32:26,881
18 years  I hate Wilford.

886
01:32:32,721 --> 01:32:35,265
18 years i've waited for this moment.

887
01:32:41,564 --> 01:32:43,064
And now i'm here.

888
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:00,765
Open the gate.

889
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:05,234
Please.

890
01:33:07,256 --> 01:33:09,632
Your story is so beautiful, Curtis.

891
01:33:11,969 --> 01:33:13,886
But I don't want to open the door.

892
01:33:16,092 --> 01:33:18,391
You know what I want?

893
01:33:20,685 --> 01:33:22,561
I want to open a door.

894
01:33:26,109 --> 01:33:27,775
But not this one.

895
01:33:29,362 --> 01:33:30,820
That one.

896
01:33:36,953 --> 01:33:39,417
The one that leads to the outside.

897
01:33:40,122 --> 01:33:43,375
We've been sentenced for 18 years.

898
01:33:43,542 --> 01:33:46,502
Everyone thinks it's a wall.

899
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:50,090
But it's a fucking door.

900
01:33:51,676 --> 01:33:55,707
Open it and get us out of here.

901
01:33:56,055 --> 01:33:59,474
And freeze to death?
Are you crazy?

902
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:04,604
I know...

903
01:34:06,231 --> 01:34:08,399
But maybe we can survive.

904
01:34:10,694 --> 01:34:13,238
You remember Yekaterina bridge?

905
01:34:13,905 --> 01:34:16,824
When we got slaughtered with an ax.

906
01:34:17,493 --> 01:34:21,711
Every new year, I check something.

907
01:34:21,831 --> 01:34:23,789
We see the wreckage of a plane...

908
01:34:23,957 --> 01:34:25,917
under the snow.

909
01:34:28,296 --> 01:34:30,087
For ten years

910
01:34:30,297 --> 01:34:34,890
the tail can barely seen.

911
01:34:35,011 --> 01:34:39,667
But now I can see the fuselage and wings.

912
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:45,527
There is less and less snow and ice.

913
01:34:47,189 --> 01:34:48,523
It melts.

914
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:53,444
Snow becomes more fragile,

915
01:34:53,904 --> 01:34:56,030
it doesn't take much to get rid of everything.

916
01:34:58,201 --> 01:34:59,701
Recently,

917
01:35:01,453 --> 01:35:03,412
you know what I saw?

918
01:35:05,849 --> 01:35:08,042
Outside, there was...

919
01:35:14,270 --> 01:35:15,800
Drops.

920
01:35:16,551 --> 01:35:17,969
It is not worth telling it.

921
01:35:18,136 --> 01:35:20,221
You gotta take it easy
on that Kronol.

922
01:35:20,472 --> 01:35:23,363
That bullshit is gonna fry your brain.

923
01:35:23,809 --> 01:35:25,769
You don't think i'm right.

924
01:35:26,645 --> 01:35:28,729
Kronol is the first...

925
01:35:31,274 --> 01:35:34,242
highly flammable chemical.

926
01:35:34,362 --> 01:35:35,961
A spark and boom!

927
01:35:38,698 --> 01:35:41,408
Basically, it's a fucking bomb.

928
01:35:46,811 --> 01:35:50,210
I not only store these to get high,

929
01:35:50,823 --> 01:35:53,421
but to blow that gate.

930
01:35:53,965 --> 01:35:55,131
Matches, quickly.

931
01:35:55,466 --> 01:35:56,966
What are you doing?

932
01:35:57,592 --> 01:35:58,850
Give it to me!

933
01:35:58,970 --> 01:36:00,215
Take that off the door.

934
01:36:01,471 --> 01:36:02,305
Fire!

935
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:18,641
Curtis Everett.

936
01:36:19,532 --> 01:36:22,305
I've been asked to extend
a formal invitation...

937
01:36:22,425 --> 01:36:25,131
from Mr. Wilford to join him for dinner.

938
01:36:26,622 --> 01:36:28,185
After you.

939
01:36:55,734 --> 01:36:57,694
Curtis? Is that you?

940
01:37:00,698 --> 01:37:02,157
Curtis, dear boy.

941
01:37:02,574 --> 01:37:03,712
Come in.

942
01:37:07,246 --> 01:37:09,122
Let's take a look at you.

943
01:37:09,582 --> 01:37:10,623
Are you hungry?

944
01:37:11,583 --> 01:37:14,461
You did a man's work,
coming all this way.

945
01:37:16,296 --> 01:37:18,512
Please, sit down.

946
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:22,873
You are the first human being
to have walked the total length of this train.

947
01:37:23,304 --> 01:37:24,595
Tail to Engine.

948
01:37:24,971 --> 01:37:26,305
Did you know that?

949
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:28,963
Well done, bravo.

950
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,701
None of your people have ever been here,
to the Engine.

951
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:37,149
I've never been to the tail section.

952
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,944
Why not? Too dirty for you?

953
01:37:40,613 --> 01:37:42,822
Don't want to rub against the vermint
of the tail section?

954
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:46,659
Do you think my station is without
its own drawbacks?

955
01:37:46,868 --> 01:37:48,203
It's noisy.

956
01:37:49,162 --> 01:37:50,497
And it's lonely.

957
01:37:53,042 --> 01:37:53,875
Right.

958
01:37:55,002 --> 01:37:56,086
Steaks.

959
01:37:56,587 --> 01:37:57,962
Plenty of room.

960
01:37:58,506 --> 01:38:00,770
This whore to bring you
anything you want.

961
01:38:01,384 --> 01:38:04,010
Curtis, everyone has their preordained position.

962
01:38:04,302 --> 01:38:06,595
And everyone is in their place
except you.

963
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:11,141
That's what people in the best place say
to the people in the worst place.

964
01:38:12,978 --> 01:38:15,729
There's not a soul on this train
that wouldn't trade places with you.

965
01:38:16,064 --> 01:38:17,606
Would you trade places with me?

966
01:38:17,899 --> 01:38:18,895
Fuck you.

967
01:38:19,944 --> 01:38:21,444
Curtis, dear boy.

968
01:38:21,612 --> 01:38:25,698
The fact is that we are all stuck
inside this blasted train.

969
01:38:25,908 --> 01:38:28,576
We are prisoners in this hunk of metal.

970
01:38:28,703 --> 01:38:30,185
Medium rare?

971
01:38:30,662 --> 01:38:33,081
And this train is
a close ecosystem.

972
01:38:33,248 --> 01:38:35,582
We must always strive for balance.

973
01:38:36,418 --> 01:38:40,087
Air, water, food supply,
population.

974
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,922
It must all be kept in balance.

975
01:38:42,675 --> 01:38:45,993
For optimum balance, however there'll have been time
when more...

976
01:38:46,113 --> 01:38:48,328
radical solution would required.

977
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:52,100
When the population needed to be reduced, rather...

978
01:38:52,768 --> 01:38:54,018
drastically.

979
01:38:57,314 --> 01:39:00,358
We don't have time
for true natural selection.

980
01:39:00,984 --> 01:39:05,279
We would all be hideously over crowded
and starved waiting for that.

981
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,949
The next best solution...

982
01:39:09,993 --> 01:39:13,292
is to have individual units
kill off other individual units.

983
01:39:13,997 --> 01:39:17,715
From time to time, we've had to stir the pot,
so to speak.

984
01:39:17,835 --> 01:39:21,511
The Revolt of Seven,
The McGregor Riots...

985
01:39:21,963 --> 01:39:24,256
The Great Curtis Revolution.

986
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,970
A blockbuster production with
a devilishly unpredictable plot.

987
01:39:29,345 --> 01:39:32,599
Who could predicted your counter attack
with the torch at Yaketerina?

988
01:39:34,185 --> 01:39:35,310
Pure genius.

989
01:39:36,353 --> 01:39:38,485
That wasn't what Gilliam and i
had in our plan.

990
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:39,603
What?

991
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:45,909
Don't tell me you didn't know,
Gilliam and i...

992
01:39:46,029 --> 01:39:47,238
Our plan.

993
01:39:49,033 --> 01:39:49,908
Gilliam?

994
01:39:50,743 --> 01:39:51,658
Gilliam.

995
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:55,086
The front and the tail
suppose to work together.

996
01:39:55,706 --> 01:39:58,582
He was more than a partner, really.

997
01:39:59,738 --> 01:40:00,768
He was my friend.

998
01:40:00,887 --> 01:40:01,752
Bullshit.

999
01:40:02,046 --> 01:40:03,297
I don't believe you.

1000
01:40:05,256 --> 01:40:09,301
Our original agreement was for the
insurgency to end at Yaketerina tunnel.

1001
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:12,305
And all the survivors will go back
to the tail section...

1002
01:40:13,018 --> 01:40:16,016
- To enjoy a much more space.
- You're a liar.

1003
01:40:16,393 --> 01:40:17,810
Gilliam would never do that.

1004
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:20,479
It all worked out in the end.

1005
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:24,900
Your counter attack actually made
the insurgency 10 times more exciting.

1006
01:40:25,152 --> 01:40:29,447
Unfortunately the front suffered more losses
than anticipated and...

1007
01:40:30,032 --> 01:40:32,936
Gilliam had to pay the price.

1008
01:40:35,787 --> 01:40:37,412
Ironic, isn't it?

1009
01:40:37,789 --> 01:40:42,417
How people dramatically cross that thin barrier
between life and death...

1010
01:40:43,127 --> 01:40:46,210
now there's just one last thing for us to do.

1011
01:40:48,759 --> 01:40:50,176
Tally up the numbers.

1012
01:41:01,479 --> 01:41:03,648
Hello Wilford, it's me.

1013
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:05,985
I'm at Gilliam's place.

1014
01:41:06,318 --> 01:41:07,277
Hold on.

1015
01:41:07,862 --> 01:41:09,820
Is it still the same number?

1016
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:12,573
Yes, it still stands at 74%.

1017
01:41:12,694 --> 01:41:14,449
Okay, carry on.

1018
01:41:14,948 --> 01:41:16,202
Wait.

1019
01:41:16,537 --> 01:41:20,038
Spare 18, to celebrate our 18th year.

1020
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:24,079
It's an excellent idea.

1021
01:41:31,801 --> 01:41:32,877
Your people.

1022
01:41:34,063 --> 01:41:37,271
Goddamnit Claude.
Mind the Engine!

1023
01:41:38,934 --> 01:41:41,101
She's getting sensitive recently.

1024
01:41:42,845 --> 01:41:45,023
Sit down and mind your table manners.

1025
01:41:47,067 --> 01:41:48,150
Relax.

1026
01:41:51,863 --> 01:41:53,488
Calm down.

1027
01:41:55,770 --> 01:41:59,266
Now i can see what Gilliam meant,
he told me you were brilliant and clever.

1028
01:41:59,386 --> 01:42:00,997
But always so tense.

1029
01:42:02,373 --> 01:42:04,500
When's the last time you got laid?

1030
01:42:06,377 --> 01:42:09,963
Like Gilliam said, holding a woman
is much better with two arms.

1031
01:42:18,515 --> 01:42:19,890
I'll miss Gilliam.

1032
01:42:21,894 --> 01:42:24,186
I'll miss our late night phone chats.

1033
01:42:25,939 --> 01:42:28,149
He could go on for hours.

1034
01:42:28,775 --> 01:42:30,734
All with only one arm.

1035
01:42:32,445 --> 01:42:33,988
What's with that face?

1036
01:42:35,658 --> 01:42:36,949
What's the matter?

1037
01:42:38,077 --> 01:42:40,118
You look like a crazy person.

1038
01:42:40,578 --> 01:42:42,747
As if there aren't enough crazies
on this train.

1039
01:43:12,027 --> 01:43:13,104
Blood!

1040
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:17,591
Are you okay?

1041
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,457
What? What happened?

1042
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:25,631
Get down.

1043
01:43:41,681 --> 01:43:42,854
Yona.

1044
01:43:42,975 --> 01:43:45,100
We must open this door.

1045
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:49,853
You see those cables?

1046
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:51,463
There are so many cables.

1047
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:53,818
Die!

1048
01:43:54,444 --> 01:43:55,653
Bastard!

1049
01:43:56,363 --> 01:44:00,349
It is easier for someone to survive on this train...

1050
01:44:00,469 --> 01:44:02,743
if they have some level
of insanity.

1051
01:44:04,579 --> 01:44:07,198
As Gilliam well understood...

1052
01:44:07,318 --> 01:44:11,461
we need to maintain the proper balance
of anxiety and fear...

1053
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:15,109
chaos and horror in order to keep life going.

1054
01:44:15,841 --> 01:44:20,402
If we don't have that, we need to invent it.

1055
01:44:21,180 --> 01:44:25,784
In that sense, the Great Curtis Revolution
you invented was truly a masterpiece.

1056
01:44:26,476 --> 01:44:27,350
Yona.

1057
01:44:28,061 --> 01:44:29,479
Red, number 8.

1058
01:44:29,688 --> 01:44:31,021
No, 7.

1059
01:44:37,029 --> 01:44:38,488
Come with me, Curtis.

1060
01:44:39,405 --> 01:44:41,239
Something i want to show you.

1061
01:44:41,824 --> 01:44:43,076
You deserve it.

1062
01:44:46,412 --> 01:44:47,329
Come on.

1063
01:44:56,798 --> 01:44:58,747
She's waking up now.

1064
01:45:27,078 --> 01:45:28,537
Cozy yes?

1065
01:45:29,206 --> 01:45:30,512
Peaceful.

1066
01:45:31,332 --> 01:45:33,456
You are now in her heart.

1067
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:37,934
I've devoted my entire life for this.

1068
01:45:39,048 --> 01:45:41,015
The Eternal Engine.

1069
01:45:43,261 --> 01:45:45,640
It is the eternity itself.

1070
01:45:48,975 --> 01:45:51,601
Have you ever been alone on this train?

1071
01:45:52,979 --> 01:45:55,355
When was the last time you were alone?

1072
01:45:56,817 --> 01:45:59,492
You can't remember, can you?

1073
01:46:00,863 --> 01:46:02,786
So please do.

1074
01:46:02,905 --> 01:46:04,586
Take your time.

1075
01:47:04,509 --> 01:47:06,252
I just wrote it.

1076
01:47:07,429 --> 01:47:09,210
It's for you, Curtis.

1077
01:47:10,224 --> 01:47:11,329
Here.

1078
01:47:24,204 --> 01:47:25,820
I am old.

1079
01:47:27,157 --> 01:47:29,560
I want you to take my Station.

1080
01:47:30,827 --> 01:47:32,905
It's what you've always wanted.

1081
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:38,671
It's what Gilliam wanted too.

1082
01:47:41,296 --> 01:47:43,213
You must tend the Engine...

1083
01:47:44,173 --> 01:47:45,849
Keep her humming.

1084
01:47:51,806 --> 01:47:53,099
Look, Curtis.

1085
01:47:54,434 --> 01:47:56,143
Beyond the gate...

1086
01:47:57,854 --> 01:48:02,608
Sections after sections percisely where they've always been
and where they'll always be.

1087
01:48:02,775 --> 01:48:04,859
All adding up to what?

1088
01:48:06,779 --> 01:48:08,140
The train.

1089
01:48:10,574 --> 01:48:13,411
And now the perfectly correct number
of human beings...

1090
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:17,122
All in their proper places,
all adding up to what?

1091
01:48:17,707 --> 01:48:18,832
Humanity.

1092
01:48:19,501 --> 01:48:21,335
The train is the world.

1093
01:48:22,503 --> 01:48:24,005
We the humanity.

1094
01:48:26,341 --> 01:48:30,927
And now you have the sacred responsibility to lead
all humanity.

1095
01:48:31,555 --> 01:48:34,724
Without you, Curtis, humanity will cease to exist.

1096
01:48:36,184 --> 01:48:39,095
You've seen what people do
without leadership.

1097
01:48:39,729 --> 01:48:41,730
They devour one another.

1098
01:49:04,337 --> 01:49:06,087
Yona, the Kronol!

1099
01:49:10,301 --> 01:49:12,292
Yona, stop! No.

1100
01:49:14,907 --> 01:49:16,359
No bullets?

1101
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:25,315
Get the Kronol then.

1102
01:49:26,568 --> 01:49:27,693
Look at them.

1103
01:49:29,445 --> 01:49:31,279
That's how people are.

1104
01:49:32,323 --> 01:49:33,407
You know.

1105
01:49:33,949 --> 01:49:35,326
You've seen this.

1106
01:49:36,494 --> 01:49:37,828
You've been this.

1107
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,458
Ridiculous. Pathetic, aren't they?

1108
01:49:44,502 --> 01:49:46,921
You can save them from themselves.

1109
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:51,300
This is what Gilliam saved you for.

1110
01:49:57,265 --> 01:49:58,573
Curtis.

1111
01:49:59,341 --> 01:50:01,143
This is your destiny.

1112
01:50:06,554 --> 01:50:07,582
It's done!

1113
01:50:07,703 --> 01:50:10,327
Curtis, matches.

1114
01:50:14,032 --> 01:50:16,970
Curtis! The match!

1115
01:50:50,234 --> 01:50:53,237
The space only allows for a very small person.

1116
01:50:55,114 --> 01:50:57,274
Young children under 5.

1117
01:50:57,742 --> 01:51:02,121
The engine lasts forever but
not to all of its parts.

1118
01:51:02,288 --> 01:51:06,756
That piece of equipment
went extinct recently.

1119
01:51:06,877 --> 01:51:09,220
We needed a replacement.

1120
01:51:10,046 --> 01:51:14,569
Thank goodness the tail section
manufactured us a steady supplies of kids.

1121
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:17,136
So we can keep going manually.

1122
01:51:21,056 --> 01:51:22,600
Fucking bastard!

1123
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:47,291
Yona...

1124
01:51:49,961 --> 01:51:51,170
Take the fire.

1125
01:52:09,314 --> 01:52:10,717
Only one left.

1126
01:52:21,826 --> 01:52:25,246
Critical engine shutdown.

1127
01:52:25,365 --> 01:52:27,101
Okay.

1128
01:52:27,576 --> 01:52:30,585
Please stand at safe distance.

1129
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:46,099
Andy? Is that you?

1130
01:52:48,130 --> 01:52:49,279
Andy!

1131
01:52:50,020 --> 01:52:51,604
Do you remember me?

1132
01:52:52,023 --> 01:52:54,315
Andy, stop, listen to me.

1133
01:52:54,609 --> 01:52:56,890
Don't go up those stairs,
listen.

1134
01:52:58,320 --> 01:52:59,282
Andy!

1135
01:53:00,532 --> 01:53:02,490
Come here, come over here.

1136
01:53:05,287 --> 01:53:06,787
Andy, listen to me!

1137
01:53:07,622 --> 01:53:08,913
Get out of there!

1138
01:53:14,087 --> 01:53:16,802
Goddamnit Andy, listen to me.

1139
01:53:16,922 --> 01:53:21,225
Curtis, don't be so melodramatic.

1140
01:53:22,059 --> 01:53:25,555
You know everyone has their own
preordained position.

1141
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,735
Nice.

1142
01:57:14,618 --> 01:57:17,838
Dad!

1143
01:57:18,731 --> 01:57:22,671
Dad...

1144
01:57:27,297 --> 01:57:28,637
Curtis.

1145
01:57:39,894 --> 01:57:41,479
Stay here.
