0:45,128 --> 00:00:46,129
The Vampire and Lycan...

2
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,422
...clans had been at war...

3
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,258
...for centuries before I was born...

4
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:51,927
...their conflict...

5
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:52,803
...hidden from...

6
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,679
...the human world.

7
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:56,557
I was turned...

8
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,641
...by a Vampire.

9
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,104
Given the strength...

10
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:02,938
...to avenge...

11
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:03,772
...my family...

12
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:04,648
...against the Lycans.

13
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,781
And I was good at it.

14
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,625
Then I found Michael Corvin...

15
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:27,838
...a human that was...

16
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,464
...turned to neither Vampire...

17
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,340
...nor Lycan...

18
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:32,759
...but a hybrid...

19
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,136
...of the two.

20
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:35,262
Everything changed.

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,516
Allies turned...

22
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,517
...enemies...

23
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,394
...and the Vampire elders I had...

24
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,354
...protected for over six centuries...

25
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:45,981
...wanted me dead.

26
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,610
We retaliated...

27
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,946
...killed the elders...

28
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,324
...and for a moment of time...

29
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,159
...we were safe.

30
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,789
But then...

31
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,918
...a new darkness arose.

32
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:08,921
In the nine days...

33
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,840
...since the first discovery
of the non-human species...

34
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,051
...scores of so-called "covens"
have been uncovered.

35
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,638
Estimates of the number
of infected have skyrocketed.

36
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,847
Military sources confirm...

37
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,516
...that the primary measures...

38
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,101
...of defence
against the non-humans are...

39
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,978
...ultraviolet light and silver...

40
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,065
...to which the infected
appear to have fatal sensitivity.

41
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,318
Tents are posted at every
barricade throughout the city.

42
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,820
A test will be administered...

43
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,655
...to verify...

44
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,281
...if you're clear of infection.

45
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,908
Spray her!

46
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:38,909
Spray her with silver!

47
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,665
- Get it out here!
- Help! Run!

48
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,624
No, no! Run!

49
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,383
We've begun our second
attack wave...

50
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,717
...using ultraviolet...

51
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:56,718
...and silver-nitrate...

52
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,095
...munitions, which are...

53
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,471
...deadly to the infected.

54
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,764
Due to the volatile...

55
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:01,723
...situation...

56
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,852
...martial law was declared
two hours ago.

57
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,897
Many of us have...

58
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,732
...lost loved ones to this.

59
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,949
Please know that you cannot
help them or yourself.

60
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,158
It's shocking...

61
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,159
...that not one...

62
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,244
...but two distinct...

63
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,372
...species may have been
coexisting within human populations.

64
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,584
The existence
of Vampires and Werewolves...

65
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,253
...now appear to have
actual basis in fact.

66
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,922
The city remains reluctant
to share new...

67
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:34,882
...information.

68
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,343
We are getting reports on what
appears to be a mass cleansing.

69
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,595
Fire!

70
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,556
Get back! No cameras!

71
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,267
There's no cure.

72
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,690
There it is!

73
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:53,192
Engage contact!

74
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:54,484
Man down!

75
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,819
- Man down!
- Cover me!

76
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,648
The Purge.

77
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,109
Human beings no longer
kill each other.

78
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,113
We are the enemy
they've been waiting for.

79
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,826
Escape has become
our only chance of survival.

80
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:46,954
Therefore...

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,498
...Michael and I are leaving tonight.

82
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:54,503
Halt!

83
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,883
Delta 6 in pursuit!

84
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,248
Stop! Get down on the ground!

85
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,699
She'll be here any minute.

86
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,534
- You be ready to go.
- Better hurry.

87
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,041
Tango Unit moving into position.

88
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,045
We have the hybrid in sight.

89
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,255
Hold your fire. Leave this one alive.

90
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,596
Delta in position.

91
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:28,722
- Watch your flank.
- Secure.

92
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,681
Move, move, move!

93
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,017
Alpha Unit in position.

94
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,439
Arming silver grenade!

95
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,442
Michael!

96
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,860
Fire!

97
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,082
- Move in!
- Alpha 4, move in.

98
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,751
Grenades, fire!

99
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,127
Retrieve the bodies.

100
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,441
Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.

101
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,401
Subject 2 has escaped.

102
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,486
Security units on alert.

103
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,574
Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.

104
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,620
Subject 2 has escaped.
Security units on alert.

105
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,997
Subject 2 has escaped.

106
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,874
Security units on alert.

107
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,042
Subject 2...

108
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,336
...has escaped.
Security units on alert.

109
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,547
Defrost sequence initiated.

110
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:26,757
Lowering compression...

111
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,342
...in Subject 1 cryo-chamber.

112
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,057
Look out!

113
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,225
Defrost sequence...

114
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,643
...complete.

115
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,853
- Subject 2! Get it!
- Over there...

116
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,272
...by the chamber!
Don't let it get away!

117
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,710
Security violation, Level 6.

118
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,212
All containment personnel to Level 6.

119
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,442
Jacob.

120
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,611
Subject 2 escaped,
it's in the building.

121
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,782
We've got Subject 1
in full lockdown.

122
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:19,119
- Give me the status.
- Subject 1 has broken free.

123
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,748
- We need to flash-burn immediately.
- No, wait. Let me see.

124
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,750
Open it.

125
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,220
Put it back to sleep.

126
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,890
Hurry.

127
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,393
Releasing...

128
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,479
...maximum dose of fentanyl.

129
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,877
What is this place?

130
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,547
Where's Michael?

131
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,302
No, no, no. No, no, no.

132
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,237
All non-security personnel...

133
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,572
...clear the building!

134
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,615
Security command, outside now!

135
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,539
- There she is!
- Stop!

136
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,040
Don't move!

137
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,054
Multiple casualties on Level 6!
Medical to alert status!

138
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,097
Prepare for full...

139
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,099
...containment on Level 6!

140
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,018
I repeat, full containment...

141
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,436
...on Level 6!

142
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:28,457
I see her.

143
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:29,458
East corridor. Send security.

144
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,667
No. Let her go.

145
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:31,627
She'll lead us...

146
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:32,586
...to Subject 2.

147
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:33,795
No, don't shoot!

148
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:35,672
Let her go.

149
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:06,995
Attention, all units.

150
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:09,998
Subject 1 and Subject 2
have escaped the perimeter...

151
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,835
...and are no longer
under Antigen control.

152
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,755
Secure the outer gates and use
extreme caution upon encounter.

153
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:20,300
Report immediately upon
coming into contact...

154
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,315
Hey, how did you get in there?

155
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,734
You're not allowed in here.

156
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,028
The pier is closed.

157
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:04,947
Since when?

158
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,283
A long time ago. Come on.

159
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,494
How long?

160
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,832
About 12 years ago.

161
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:18,418
Since the cleansing. Why?

162
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,295
You okay, ma'am?

163
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:22,297
Attention, all units, code three call.

164
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:25,259
Receiving a report of an assault,
Exit 39 underpass.

165
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:29,638
Possible non-human aggressor.
Proceed with caution.

166
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,391
CDC already en route.
All area units respond.

167
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,979
Ma'am? Hey!

168
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,313
Ma'am?

169
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,178
- What are you doing?
- Stay there! Don't move!

170
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,513
- Identify yourself!
- Get back here right now!

171
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,285
Whoever it is,
they couldn't have made it very far.

172
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,037
I'll alert CDC to keep an eye out.

173
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,330
They're en route.

174
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:39,500
- There's no way this attack was human.
- You don't know that.

175
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,252
Don't know what?

176
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,213
The guy's shredded.
His throat was...

177
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,381
- ...in the gutter.
- Just let me handle it.

178
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,051
What's to handle?
This has Lycan written all over it.

179
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:49,885
Detective...

180
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:53,555
...when was the last time you heard
about a reported Lycan killing?

181
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,724
A couple years ago.

182
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:58,227
How many years
have you been with this department?

183
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,729
What? I've been here
for three months.

184
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:02,272
Exactly.

185
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,901
You question me less
until you know a bit more.

186
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,320
- We clear?
- Crystal.

187
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,075
Detective Sebastian.

188
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,244
Detective, we've just
received a report.

189
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,412
There's been a disturbance
at Antigen Labs.

190
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,206
A witness says
there was an escape.

191
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,916
They said someone jumped...

192
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,252
...out of a window.
This is a priority...

193
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:24,419
...investigation.

194
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,088
We need you over there ASAP.

195
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:27,756
We're on our way.

196
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,175
Hey, let's go.
Johnson, you're the lead.

197
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,094
You got it, detective. Will do.

198
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:49,903
Who's in charge?

199
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,784
There's a Detective Sebastian
here to see you, sir.

200
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,413
Where is he?

201
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,623
In the lobby, sir.

202
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,712
You'll be relieved to know...

203
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,714
...the situation is well under control.

204
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,216
- What happened?
- I repeat, well under control.

205
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,051
I repeat, what happened?

206
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:16,889
Yes, there are reports to be filed.

207
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:22,186
One of our test subjects attempted to
escape. We were forced to put it down.

208
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,938
- So nothing got out?
- Only a stray bullet.

209
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,774
- And the test subject?
- Flash-burned.

210
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:28,984
Will that be all?

211
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,945
A few things to attend to.
You could imagine.

212
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,323
Doctor, we received
an anonymous call...

213
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,825
...that something else
escaped through a window.

214
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:40,787
Detective, our mission at Antigen
is to develop ways of preventing...

215
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,750
...infection, not releasing it
into the general population.

216
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,003
I lost my son to this disease.

217
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,548
There's no room for error with me
when it comes to the safety of...

218
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,051
...the public.
If something had escaped...

219
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,345
...the authorities
would have been notified.

220
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,138
You are an authority, are you not?

221
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,850
Now, if you'll excuse me...

222
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,877
The guy in charge says it's nothing.
Let's go.

223
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,880
Yeah, and he's full of shit.
Look at this.

224
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,883
Want me to report it, sir?

225
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,635
No. I'll do it.

226
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,971
I don't mind. I can do it for you.

227
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,891
All right, sir.

228
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,586
The prisoner that helped me escape,
the one you called Subject 2...

229
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:12,921
...was it a hybrid?

230
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,382
Yes.

231
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,092
What were you doing with us?

232
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,178
We...

233
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,764
We help the government
identify the infected.

234
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,601
We were using your DNA
to try to find a cure...

235
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,061
...to prevent another outbreak.

236
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,813
You were told that I would...

237
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,773
...lead you to the hybrid. Why?

238
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:35,319
Subject 2 is restricted information.

239
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,112
I don't have the clearance.

240
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,239
You're lying.

241
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,658
No!

242
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,411
No, please!

243
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,412
All I know is...

244
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,122
...there's a connection between you.

245
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,790
Your brain waves...

246
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,751
...fall into sync
when you're close...

247
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:51,793
...to each other.

248
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,212
You can see through
each other's eyes!

249
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,423
Please don't!

250
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,091
I'm the one who let you go!

251
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,135
Now we're even.

252
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,628
What the hell was that?

253
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,005
Creepy is what.

254
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,924
- I'm calling it in.
- Let's go.

255
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:28,724
Shit.

256
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:40,027
Don't.

257
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:41,278
Why not?

258
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,197
We're the same.

259
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,202
Why are you following me?

260
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,078
We monitor the police frequencies.

261
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:51,788
"We"?

262
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:54,750
Do you know what attacked
that human under the bridge?

263
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:56,877
No.

264
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,715
Lycans.

265
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,091
What remains of them, yes.

266
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,763
They've been hiding
down here like rats...

267
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,847
...since the Purge.

268
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:12,267
Diseased and starving, they rarely
show themselves above ground.

269
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,187
Which means that something
has got them riled up.

270
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,440
Something you're not telling me.

271
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,082
Michael!

272
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,751
Do you know her?

273
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,170
No.

274
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:29,344
They will come back in numbers.

275
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:32,598
We can't leave her here.

276
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:38,520
Come on.

277
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,159
Let's try the van.

278
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,291
Get in. Move! Move!

279
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,519
Three of them behind us.

280
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:31,216
Go!

281
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,679
Hurry, Selene!

282
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:37,014
They're getting in the back!

283
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,815
Fucking piece of shit!

284
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,782
The girl! They're taking her!

285
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:32,611
You drive.

286
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:20,951
She's not healing.

287
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:23,537
We have a doctor that can help her
at our coven.

288
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:25,747
How did you...

289
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,124
...find me?

290
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,794
What's your name?

291
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,255
Subject 2.

292
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:36,216
And you are Subject 1.

293
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:39,219
I freed you.

294
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,557
Do you not know who I am?

295
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,769
They told me that I had no mother...

296
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,147
...that she died when I was born.

297
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:53,775
I never believed it. I...

298
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:56,486
I felt you.

299
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:58,906
Saw images through your eyes.

300
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:02,117
But then someone outside my door...

301
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:07,456
...they said since I was no longer
a child, the wait was over...

302
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,751
...that I'd be dead soon.

303
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:14,296
And that my own mother,
right next door...

304
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,508
...would never even know I'd existed.

305
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,637
What did they tell you of your father?

306
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:24,473
They must have told you something.

307
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,683
Do you see images through him?

308
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,393
No.

309
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,145
Only you.

310
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:35,984
No, please!

311
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,165
She's never stepped foot
outside the lab.

312
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:51,834
How can she possibly survive?

313
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,003
I understand the risk of reporting
her escape to the authorities.

314
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,296
No record of her birth.

315
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,799
Questions will be asked.
I'm well aware of that.

316
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,051
But if she dies,
all our years of research--

317
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:02,845
Rather than tell me
how to do my job...

318
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:06,014
...why not take a look
at your own professional conduct?

319
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,851
And how your continual need
to endow this creature...

320
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:13,021
...with human traits has led to
the laxness of its security protocols.

321
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:15,858
It's not a human being, Lida!
It's not your child.

322
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,192
It's not to be coddled.

323
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,361
It's a blight of nature.

324
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:25,325
Stop worrying. It'll come back to us.

325
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,670
Get Olivia at once.

326
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,135
Again you break my rules. Why?

327
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,429
She was attacked.

328
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,014
She is not healing.

329
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,600
And for this
you compromise our safety?

330
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:14,518
You have...

331
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:16,812
...no reason to fear us.

332
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:21,817
Do you think I'm foolish enough
to take you at your word?

333
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,194
No reason...

334
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:27,156
...to fear a Death Dealer
who fell in love with a Lycan...

335
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,366
...who murdered two of our elders...

336
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:31,869
...and who, at every turn,
has betrayed...

337
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:33,328
...her own kind.

338
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:37,207
Do you know who this is?

339
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,043
Yes.

340
00:32:41,837 --> 00:32:43,881
But it was we
who betrayed her, Father.

341
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:46,925
Let her through.

342
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:50,804
She's not healing.

343
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,775
She was attacked by a lower Lycan.

344
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:05,652
Two hours ago.

345
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,199
Her cell repair is...

346
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:13,702
...active but weakened.

347
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:17,706
She has no...

348
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:20,501
...origin bite marks...

349
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,128
...or scars.

350
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:27,090
I've never seen a child like this before.

351
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,885
When did you last feed?

352
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,553
Feed?

353
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,515
Give her blood.

354
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:44,024
Child...

355
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:45,567
...you must.

356
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:04,920
Slowly.

357
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,089
Slowly.

358
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:10,926
There.

359
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:13,762
There, now.

360
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,518
She's healing.

361
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:23,438
- And quickly.
- Good.

362
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:25,440
Take her to my room.
She needs to rest.

363
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:26,608
No.

364
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:29,278
Look at the eyes.

365
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,665
I never believed it.

366
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:43,667
They do exist.

367
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:47,421
This is not one of us.

368
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:50,007
No, it's something more, Father.

369
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:54,595
What do you know of her?

370
00:34:57,181 --> 00:35:00,058
I was held captive
at a place called Antigen.

371
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,896
One of the other prisoners freed me.

372
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,315
I believed it was Michael Corvin...

373
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,984
...the only hybrid I knew
existed at that time.

374
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:11,195
Yes, yes, your Lycan lover, long dead.

375
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:13,030
What is this, then?

376
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:16,366
None of your concern.

377
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:19,870
As soon as she regains her strength,
I will leave with her.

378
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,409
I used to hear stories...

379
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:00,911
...of the Death Dealers.

380
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:05,749
That they were a thing of the past...

381
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,793
...never to return.

382
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:11,046
I'm glad they were wrong.

383
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:14,550
You knew who I am...

384
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:18,720
...and yet you still brought me here.

385
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,683
Thank you.

386
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,643
You're a fighter.

387
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,521
We could use more like you
to teach us.

388
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:28,438
I'm not sure...

389
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:30,023
...your father would agree.

390
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,902
There was a time when he would have.
That's why he dislikes you so much.

391
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:38,323
I think it reminds him of the days when
he defended us with fire and steel...

392
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,035
...rather than hollow words.
He knows how much we need you.

393
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:46,582
- I'm not a leader.
- But you fight for what you believe in.

394
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,750
You always have.

395
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:49,793
I don't know...

396
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,336
...what I believe in anymore.

397
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:54,047
I don't recognise this world.

398
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,091
But you haven't changed.

399
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:59,261
I saw it in your eyes
when you looked at the child.

400
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:02,681
You will protect her.

401
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,141
It's in your blood.

402
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,893
It's who you are.

403
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,938
When you leave, take me with you.

404
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:16,296
You distrust me.

405
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:26,014
Of course you do.
I made you feel unwelcome.

406
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:28,267
And for that, I'm sorry.

407
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:34,773
Those eyes...

408
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:37,359
...they're special.

409
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:42,739
I know exactly what you are.

410
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,086
My father says that...

411
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:59,673
...should we survive as a species,
these relics will help...

412
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,384
...our descendants know
who we were and how we lived.

413
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:04,178
And what do you say?

414
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,722
That if we continue to live
as we do now...

415
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:09,725
...then we disgrace the past
and don't deserve a future.

416
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:12,227
We must resist the humans...

417
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:14,855
...wherever and whenever possible.

418
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,191
Between the first and second Purges...

419
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,571
...Lycan youth rallied in the same way
against the prudence of their elders.

420
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:26,283
Their calls for violent action
carried the day.

421
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,951
The result?

422
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,996
The Werewolves are nearly extinct.

423
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,875
Is that what you wish for us,
extinction?

424
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:36,627
Yet you bring...

425
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:39,087
...her offspring into our home.
Do you honestly...

426
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:42,216
...believe the humans
will allow her to remain free?

427
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,468
They will hunt her down
at any expense.

428
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:47,554
- Then we can help protect them.
- Protect them?

429
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:49,932
They leave tonight.

430
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:50,933
This isn't...

431
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:51,767
...prudence.

432
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:53,810
This is cowardice, plain and simple.

433
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,689
How dare you?

434
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,108
How dare you...

435
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,444
...do so little?

436
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:36,103
I dreamt of the day we would meet.

437
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:41,275
Like a silly little girl.

438
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,409
You're as cold as one already dead.

439
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:56,498
Yesterday...

440
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:59,293
...I was with your father.

441
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:05,757
He was only a little further away
from me than you are now.

442
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:09,803
I went to sleep.

443
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:13,807
And when I awoke the next day...

444
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,102
...I learned that, overnight...

445
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,522
...12 years had passed.

446
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:25,360
And instead of the only man
I've ever loved...

447
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:29,198
...there stood a girl with his eyes.

448
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:36,079
My heart is not cold.

449
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:37,915
It's broken.

450
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:43,754
I'm so sorry.

451
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:55,432
What is it?

452
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:58,727
They're here.

453
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:02,272
Stay here. Wait for me.

454
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:03,899
No, take me with you.

455
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,234
Please.

456
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,737
I won't let anyone hurt you. I promise.

457
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:09,947
Lock the door.

458
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:14,034
Everybody to the shelter. Now!

459
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:16,954
No!

460
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,081
Prepare the armoury.

461
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:21,333
Do as I say! Go, go!

462
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,753
Pay heed to me!

463
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,090
No! We stand and we fight.

464
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:46,441
No! Have you no sense?

465
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:51,613
Stop this now!

466
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:56,118
We lived safely for years
and you brought humans into this coven.

467
00:42:56,535 --> 00:42:57,452
They want the girl.

468
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:59,288
They'll stop at nothing
to get her.

469
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:02,332
This day was bound to come,
with or without us.

470
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:05,085
Let's move!
Munitions, let's go! Everyone!

471
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:06,503
Are you mad?

472
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,965
We have no more than a handful
of fighters. We will be annihilated!

473
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,384
And what's your plan, Father?

474
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:14,136
Let's go! Now!

475
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:18,307
- Where are you going?
- To get her away from here.

476
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:21,185
- He's right. I shouldn't have come.
- He doesn't understand.

477
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:23,896
The humans will follow us out.
Hold them off till then.

478
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:26,315
They're only here for her.

479
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:29,318
She's more powerful than any of us.

480
00:43:29,485 --> 00:43:31,153
They fear the day she discovers it.

481
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:34,031
I have to get her out of here.

482
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:13,654
Lycan!

483
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:19,076
Silver ammunition!

484
00:44:19,243 --> 00:44:20,077
Now!

485
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:21,453
Defend the second...

486
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,287
...rotunda!

487
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:23,747
Move! Move!

488
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,418
Open the door!

489
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:12,254
Let's go.

490
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:37,571
Move! Move!

491
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:19,238
We need to go.

492
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:46,014
What the hell was that?

493
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,687
- Take her somewhere safe.
- No.

494
00:46:51,854 --> 00:46:53,313
Take her. Go.

495
00:49:35,225 --> 00:49:36,727
Where is she?

496
00:49:37,186 --> 00:49:38,687
They took her.

497
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:41,523
They accepted her.

498
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,319
As a gift from me.

499
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:26,401
Do you know what you've done?

500
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:28,987
Do you have any idea?

501
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:31,406
What would you have had me do?

502
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:35,869
Fight to the last to protect
the very one who brought this upon us?

503
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:37,412
We're defeated.

504
00:50:38,413 --> 00:50:40,457
Our coven is destroyed.
My son...

505
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:41,458
...is dead.

506
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,544
Because of you.

507
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:45,796
Why?

508
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:48,715
Because he helped that...

509
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,509
...child of yours.

510
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,761
If they kill her, so be it.

511
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:56,265
Your son died because
he was fighting for all of you.

512
00:50:57,933 --> 00:51:00,102
Because he knew that running
is not survival.

513
00:51:01,979 --> 00:51:03,564
Those were Lycans.

514
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,817
Not extinct. More powerful than ever.

515
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:10,112
That thing was more than twice the size
of any Lycan I've seen.

516
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:12,781
They risked...

517
00:51:12,948 --> 00:51:17,077
...showing themselves after more than
a decade in hiding because of her.

518
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:19,538
And you handed her over to them.

519
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:22,457
She is the last...

520
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:26,628
...direct descendant
of Alexander Corvinus.

521
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:30,507
The only hybrid child
that has ever existed.

522
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:35,387
Whatever it is the Lycans
want from her...

523
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,765
...your son knew it was
worth dying for.

524
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:47,024
What are you doing?

525
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:17,846
David.

526
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:33,630
A force of two dozen Lycans...

527
00:53:33,797 --> 00:53:36,967
...attacked and destroyed
one of our covens last night.

528
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:40,220
You're not surprised.

529
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:44,266
You knew the Lycans
were not extinct.

530
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:47,144
- How?
- Just a feeling.

531
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:49,605
I'm not good with feelings.

532
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,607
I want to know how.

533
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:54,026
This is not the place for this.

534
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,278
And you're not gonna kill me.

535
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:57,446
Really?

536
00:53:57,613 --> 00:53:58,739
No.

537
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:01,200
Because you wouldn't need
a fucking gun to do it.

538
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:05,037
A few years ago...

539
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:08,123
...the government declared
"mission accomplished" on Lycans.

540
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,542
The feds announced that
we were to only focus...

541
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:12,377
...on your kind now.

542
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:15,839
Three months ago,
a friend of mine sent me this.

543
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:20,761
It arrived two days after he was found
hanging from his own ceiling fan.

544
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:25,432
Two hundred suspected
Lycan captures.

545
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,142
Every case was investigated.

546
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:29,478
Every blood test came back negative.

547
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:30,938
My friend began to wonder:

548
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:34,566
Were they all false leads or was
someone trying to protect the Lycans?

549
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,320
Helping them replenish their packs,
letting them regroup.

550
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:40,489
What about your own department?

551
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:46,829
They have my daughter.
All I care about is getting her back.

552
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:52,960
If you're protecting someone, I don't
care. I'm not after them. I just want her.

553
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:54,545
No.

554
00:54:55,504 --> 00:54:59,424
Even if there are others in my
department, they don't have authority.

555
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,301
This goes much higher.

556
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:04,304
I believe, all the way to the top.

557
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:06,849
Or to the bottom.

558
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:08,684
What do you mean?

559
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:11,895
Who administers the tests?

560
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:16,150
We're a bit short on time,
so if you please, take a look at these.

561
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:19,528
This schedule takes you
from the moment we adjourn...

562
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:22,114
...through to the final manufacture
of the vaccine.

563
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:27,536
If we stick to this plan, inoculations
should begin within three months.

564
00:55:27,703 --> 00:55:29,538
Any questions, now's the time.

565
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:32,958
After today's surgery, there will be
no communication between us...

566
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:35,377
...until we meet again
in the inoculation centre.

567
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:37,004
Doctor, in terms...

568
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:38,505
...of your test subject...

569
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:41,383
...he continues to demonstrate
immunity to silver?

570
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:42,885
Absolutely.

571
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:47,472
And additional inoculations,
administered only as a precaution...

572
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:49,725
...triggered side effects
we never imagined.

573
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,226
Vast increases...

574
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:53,645
...in strength, muscle mass...

575
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:55,481
...self-healing...

576
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:56,815
...stamina.

577
00:55:58,984 --> 00:56:00,319
You said she was essential
to our research.

578
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:03,572
- Yes, and will continue to be.
- How?

579
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:05,949
By vivisecting her?

580
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:08,118
You weren't meant to have that.

581
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:09,912
I cared for this little girl...

582
00:56:10,496 --> 00:56:13,749
...all these years,
and you expect me to sit by...

583
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:16,752
- ...while you--
- Harvest its genetic material?

584
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:20,214
I expect nothing from you.

585
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:22,925
I hired you to look after it...

586
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:26,428
...and for the most part,
you did an excellent job.

587
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:28,764
Saving the lives of thousands.

588
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:31,808
What are you talking about?

589
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:34,436
An entire species
saved from extinction.

590
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,568
Jacob.

591
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:30,492
After today, you won't have to
wait so long between injections.

592
00:57:31,118 --> 00:57:33,162
Are you sure she's ready?

593
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:35,080
Oestrogen levels high...

594
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:38,333
...intervals between menses
holding steady.

595
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:40,502
It's come of age.

596
00:57:41,253 --> 00:57:44,631
Everything's worked out
just as we'd hoped.

597
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:50,554
You're the first proof of it.

598
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:54,141
I'm proud of you, son.

599
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:00,689
Now that it's with us again...

600
00:58:00,856 --> 00:58:04,026
...we'll have all the genetic material
we need, ready for cloning.

601
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:07,696
Enough to produce
an endless supply of vaccine.

602
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:09,740
Imagine.

603
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:13,160
Our species immune to silver.

604
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:14,995
No more hiding.

605
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:18,624
Every Lycan under our command
as powerful as you are.

606
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:22,044
I've even begun injecting myself.

607
00:58:22,711 --> 00:58:25,297
I only wish Mother
were here to see it.

608
00:58:26,048 --> 00:58:28,509
Your mother chose to
remain human.

609
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:32,346
She abandoned us.

610
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:36,350
Remember that.

611
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:51,990
Of course, Father.

612
00:58:59,248 --> 00:58:59,915
Look...

613
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:04,169
...if you're right about Antigen, who
knows how many Lycans will be there?

614
00:59:04,545 --> 00:59:07,256
The second you step foot inside,
you'll be surrounded.

615
00:59:07,422 --> 00:59:08,507
I'm hoping so.

616
00:59:11,093 --> 00:59:13,303
I know you want her back.
I can help you.

617
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,098
- Why?
- Just tell me what your plan is.

618
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:42,791
It's worse if you try to fight it.

619
00:59:43,959 --> 00:59:45,210
Trust me.

620
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:49,298
So how is it you're actually...

621
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:51,884
...able to survive in the sunlight?

622
00:59:53,802 --> 00:59:55,429
It was a gift.

623
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,473
From a man named
Alexander Corvinus.

624
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:00,851
The founding father.

625
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:07,316
I used to be married, to a nurse.

626
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:11,028
One day at work, she was bitten.

627
01:00:12,988 --> 01:00:16,992
Nobody knew but us.
We lived like that for a few years.

628
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:20,829
Then came the Purge.

629
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:26,043
The feds were conducting door-to-doors
and when they knocked on ours...

630
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:34,468
...well, she told me she loved me...

631
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:38,597
...and then she let the sunlight in.

632
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:41,934
I had to watch her burn.

633
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:05,082
Okay.

634
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:09,002
You got me?

635
01:01:09,628 --> 01:01:10,921
Yes.

636
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:13,382
Good luck.

637
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,523
- Shit. It's her.
- In daylight?

638
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:30,357
It's her!

639
01:01:30,524 --> 01:01:31,441
- Go!
- Okay.

640
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:03,765
Wait for my cue.

641
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:04,725
I'm ready.

642
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:14,276
Ops Code A. Repeat, Ops Code A.
Breach on Level 1.

643
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:16,278
Intruder ascending in Elevator 4.

644
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:18,697
I want all levels ready
on that elevator now!

645
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:24,786
- Anaesthesia ready?
- Yes, sir.

646
01:02:24,953 --> 01:02:25,829
Good.

647
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,938
Security units on alert.

648
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:53,816
Ops Code A.
Intruder on premises.

649
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:56,610
Secure the east wing.
All units, intruder's ascending...

650
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:57,653
...in the elevator.

651
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:59,196
Come on.

652
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:00,906
Let's go.

653
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:20,926
Move!

654
01:03:38,193 --> 01:03:39,736
There's your cue.

655
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:41,029
Copy.

656
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:13,896
They're using silver-nitrate gas.
Bombs on all the floors.

657
01:04:14,897 --> 01:04:18,192
It's Subject 1. We need to evacuate.

658
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:19,735
Fine.

659
01:04:19,902 --> 01:04:20,736
Start a propofol...

660
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:21,653
...infusion.

661
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:25,866
We're not cancelling this procedure,
understood? We're moving it.

662
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:28,619
You find her...

663
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:30,871
...and you destroy her.

664
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,539
With pleasure.

665
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:46,929
I'm here.

666
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:48,555
I got movement on a van in...

667
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:49,598
...Parking Level 3.

668
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:51,266
No sign of the girl.

669
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:54,770
They'll be on the move.
Just don't lose them.

670
01:04:59,942 --> 01:05:01,068
She's in the service elevator.

671
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:03,821
Get her.

672
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:04,947
I'm coming down.

673
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:30,556
Selene. Selene!

674
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:34,017
They're heading for Parking Level 2.

675
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,855
Selene.

676
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:38,981
I need to know...

677
01:05:39,148 --> 01:05:39,898
...where you are!

678
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:51,660
Shit!

679
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:07,843
Do you copy?

680
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:09,469
Selene, where are you?

681
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:41,043
I see her. I see her.

682
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:42,628
Parking Level 2.

683
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,004
They're loading her...

684
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:45,380
...into the van.

685
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:47,174
Selene, where are you?

686
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,011
Fuck it.

687
01:06:54,473 --> 01:06:57,518
Hold it right there! Stop! Stop now!

688
01:07:09,738 --> 01:07:10,405
Michael?

689
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:11,573
Get her!

690
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:12,699
Take her out!

691
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:24,670
Selene, Lane has her...

692
01:07:24,837 --> 01:07:27,422
...in the van.
They're on the move. Where are you?

693
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:29,508
They are leaving with her!
Do you hear me?

694
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:33,053
I'm on my way.

695
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:02,851
Come on, faster.

696
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:22,663
Don't stop.

697
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:23,497
Hit him!

698
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:53,110
Selene, they're heading
for Parking Level 1.

699
01:09:55,571 --> 01:09:58,532
Selene, they're getting away
on Parking Level 1. Do you copy?

700
01:09:58,824 --> 01:10:00,409
I'm coming.

701
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:24,433
Everything okay?

702
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,434
Levels are...

703
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:27,603
...holding stable, sir. Baseline vitals--

704
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:10,831
Fuck you.

705
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:55,125
Get away from her!

706
01:14:54,745 --> 01:14:56,997
It's worse if you try to fight it.

707
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:01,585
Trust me.

708
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:01,937
I heal instantly.

709
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:03,272
I'm counting on it.

710
01:17:02,206 --> 01:17:04,208
You came back for me.

711
01:17:08,712 --> 01:17:10,339
I said I would.

712
01:17:11,381 --> 01:17:12,799
Selene.

713
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:17,846
You should go.

714
01:17:20,474 --> 01:17:22,476
There's a safe house
not far from here.

715
01:17:22,643 --> 01:17:23,644
Go. I'll send them...

716
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:26,480
...on a different path,
buy you some time.

717
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:29,566
Thank you. Come on.

718
01:17:29,733 --> 01:17:31,193
David.

719
01:17:33,612 --> 01:17:35,364
Are we going back in?

720
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:36,865
We are.

721
01:17:54,633 --> 01:17:55,676
What is it?

722
01:17:57,219 --> 01:17:58,053
Michael?

723
01:18:00,264 --> 01:18:01,515
The roof.

724
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:12,109
Though the world has changed,
our enemy remains the same.

725
01:18:12,985 --> 01:18:13,902
The Lycans...

726
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:15,070
...will rebuild.

727
01:18:15,237 --> 01:18:17,322
And will hunt for her father
as they did...

728
01:18:17,489 --> 01:18:18,282
...for her.

729
01:18:21,076 --> 01:18:22,578
But as they grow stronger...

730
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:24,580
...so will we.

731
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:27,207
The Vampire coven will not only...

732
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:29,084
...survive this world...

733
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:31,670
...we will reclaim it.
