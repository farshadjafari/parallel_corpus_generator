I have no way of knowing if

Yes.

This is good.

10
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,692
Now, are you aware of the job I've
been ordered to carry out in France?

Yes.

Please tell me what you've heard.

13
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:05,033
I've heard

14
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:09,872
that the Führer has put you in charge
of rounding up the Jews left in France

15
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,875
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.

16
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:17,211
The Führer couldn't have
said it better himself.

17
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:22,800
But the meaning of your visit,

18
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:27,473
pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.

19
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,394
The Germans looked through my house
nine months ago for hiding Jews

20
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,145
and found nothing.

21
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,566
I'm aware of that.

22
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:40,568
I've read the reports of this area.

23
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:45,782
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

24
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:48,951
there is always a slight
duplication of efforts,

25
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:54,875
most of it being a complete waste of
time, but needs to be done nevertheless.

26
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:58,921
I just have a few
questions, monsieur LaPadite.

27
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,673
If you can assist me with answers,

28
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,885

Now,

30
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,442
before the occupation, there were
four Jewish families in this area,

31
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,363

32
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:30,786

33
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:34,288
and the Dreyfuses.

34
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:35,999
Is that correct?

35
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:37,084
To my knowledge,

36
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:40,629
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

37
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:44,633
Herr Colonel, would it
disturb you if I smoked my pipe?

38

this is your house, make
yourself comfortable.

40
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:52,557
Now, according to these papers,

41
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:56,894
all the Jewish families in this
area have been accounted for

42
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,815
except the Dreyfuses.

43
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:04,695
Somewhere in the last year it
would appear they've vanished.

44
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:08,072
Which leads me to the conclusion that
they've either made good their escape

45
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:11,076
or someone is very
successfully hiding them.

46
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:15,913

Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?

47
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:16,956

where rumors, true or
false, are often revealing.

00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,383

(THANKING IN FRENCH)

91
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,734
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."

92
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:32,360
Precisely.

93

I understand your
trepidation in repeating it.

94
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:39,701
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker

95

have bestowed on him.

96

Actually, why he would hate the
name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.

lt would appear he has done
everything in his power to earn it.

98
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:52,547
Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title

99
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,049
precisely because I've earned it.

100
00:13:56,469 --> 00:14:00,514
The feature that makes me such an
effective hunter of the Jews is,

101
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:03,307
as opposed to most German soldiers,

102
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,393
I can think like a Jew

103
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,772
where they can only think like a German.

104
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,566
(CHUCKLING) More
precisely, a German soldier.

105
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,202
Now, if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast,

106
00:14:23,745 --> 00:14:27,289
it would be the cunning and the
predatory instinct of a hawk.

107
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,586
But if one were to determine what
attributes the Jews share with a beast,

108
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,797
it would be that of the rat.

109
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:40,427
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.

111
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,600
is I don't consider the
comparison an insult.

112
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:52,941
Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.

113
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,068

disease a rat could spread,

And except for the tail, they
even rather look alike, don't they?

It's an interesting
thought, Herr Colonel.

However interesting
as the thought may be,

132
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:49,080

difference to how you feel.

If a rat were to walk in
here, right now, as I'm talking

134
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,466
would you greet it with a
saucer of your delicious milk?

135
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:02,009
Probably not.

136
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,386
I didn't think so.

137
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,556
You don't like them.

138
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,515
You don't really know
why you don't like them.

139
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,352
All you know is you find them repulsive.

140
00:16:13,563 --> 00:16:16,607
Consequently, a German
soldier conducts a search

141
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:19,235
of a house suspected of hiding Jews.

142
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:21,738
Where does the hawk look?

143
00:16:21,822 --> 00:16:24,990
He looks in the barn, he looks in
the attic, he looks in the cellar,

144
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:27,534
he looks everywhere he would hide.

145
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:32,665
But there are so many places it
would never occur to a hawk to hide.

146
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:38,587
However, the reason the Führer has
brought me off my Alps in Austria

147
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:43,092
and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.

148
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:47,681
Because I'm aware what tremendous
feats human beings are capable of

149
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:49,807
once they abandon dignity.

make yourself at home.

that I must have my men enter your home

154

before I can officially cross
your family's name off my list.

156
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:39,065
And if there are any irregularities to
be found, rest assured they will be.

157
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,358
That is unless you have
something to tell me

158
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:44,487
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

159
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:46,823
I might add, also, that any information

160
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:51,577
that makes the performance of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.

161
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:55,957
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.

162

530
01:06:32,956 --> 01:06:34,623
An alternative to what he considers

531
01:06:34,706 --> 01:06:37,668
the Jewish-German intellectual
cinema of the '20s,

532
01:06:38,378 --> 01:06:41,045
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.

533
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,713
How's he doing?

534
01:06:43,257 --> 01:06:45,842
Frightfully sorry, sir. Once again?

535
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:50,889
You say he wants to take on
the Jews at their own game.

536
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:54,893
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,

537
01:06:55,728 --> 01:06:57,980
how's he doing?

538
01:06:58,063 --> 01:06:59,313
Quite well, actually.

539
01:06:59,983 --> 01:07:01,565
Since Goebbels has taken over,

540
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:06,070
film attendance has steadily risen
in Germany over the last eight years.

541
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:09,615
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.

542
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:13,494
I believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David O. Selznick.

543
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:19,291
Brief him.

544
01:07:19,626 --> 01:07:24,672
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time
I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.

545
01:07:25,257 --> 01:07:26,382
Three days from now

546
01:07:26,467 --> 01:07:30,804
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.

547
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:32,014
What film, sir?

548
01:07:32,097 --> 01:07:34,766
The motion picture is
called Nation's Pride.

549
01:07:35,726 --> 01:07:39,103
In attendance at this
joyous Germatic occasion

550
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:43,608
will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann,
and most of the German High Command

551
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:47,445
including all high ranking officers
of both the SS and the Gestapo,

552
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,949
as well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.

553
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:53,117
The master race at play?

554
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:57,371
Basically, we have all our
rotten eggs in one basket.

555
01:07:57,456 --> 01:08:00,000
The objective of Operation Kino,

556
01:08:00,918 --> 01:08:02,668
blow up the basket.

557
01:08:03,463 --> 01:08:07,548
And like the snows of
yesteryear, gone from this earth.

558
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:10,135
Jolly good, sir.

559
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:14,389
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines

560
01:08:14,474 --> 01:08:16,015
will be your assist.

561
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,978
The Germans call them the Basterds.

562
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:23,731
The Basterds. Never heard of them.

563
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,734
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.

564
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:30,822
But the Jerries have heard of them,
because these Yanks have been them the devil.

565
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:35,618
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.

566
01:08:35,703 --> 01:08:37,787
The Basterds will be waiting for you.

567
01:08:37,872 --> 01:08:40,623
First thing, you'll go to a
little village called Nadine.

568
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:44,543
In Nadine, there's a
tavern called La Louisiane.

569
01:08:44,628 --> 01:08:47,797
There you'll rendezvous with our
double agent. She'll take it from there.

570
01:08:47,881 --> 01:08:50,007
She's the one who is going
to get you into the premiere.

571
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:53,845
It'll be you, her, and two
German-born members of the Basterds.

572
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:57,349
She's also made all the other
arrangements you're going to need.

573
01:08:58,184 --> 01:08:59,350
How will I know her?

574
01:08:59,476 --> 01:09:02,686
I suspect that won't be
too much trouble for you.

575
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:06,690
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.

576
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,234
Bridget von Hammersmark?

577
01:09:09,487 --> 01:09:12,488
(CHUCKLING) The German movie
star is working for England?

578
01:09:12,573 --> 01:09:15,158
Yes, for the last two years now.

579
01:09:15,243 --> 01:09:18,787
One could even say that
Operation Kino was her brainchild.

580
01:09:18,871 --> 01:09:20,037
Indeed.

581
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:21,163
Got the gist?

582
01:09:21,248 --> 01:09:24,000
I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.

583
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:31,632
You didn't say the goddamn
rendezvous is in a fucking basement.

584
01:09:31,716 --> 01:09:33,051
l didn't know.

585
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:34,552
You said it was in a tavern.

586
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:35,804
lt is a tavern.

587
01:09:35,887 --> 01:09:37,264
Yeah, in a basement.

588
01:09:37,931 --> 01:09:40,809
You know, fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.

589
01:09:40,893 --> 01:09:44,186
Number one being, you're
fighting in a basement.

590
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:46,148
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?

591
01:09:46,231 --> 01:09:47,481
We wait.

592
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:52,404
Don't worry. She's a British
spy. She'll make the rendezvous.

593
01:10:13,926 --> 01:10:16,261
Stiglitz, right?

594
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:17,386
That's right, sir.

595
01:10:18,639 --> 01:10:21,140
l hear you're pretty good with that.

596
01:10:24,936 --> 01:10:28,064
You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.

597
01:10:28,315 --> 01:10:31,859
Simply making contact with our
agent. Should be uneventful.

598
01:10:33,695 --> 01:10:38,574
However, the off chance I'm
wrong, things prove eventful,

599
01:10:39,784 --> 01:10:42,703
I need to know we can all remain calm.

600
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:48,835
I don't look calm to you?

601
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:50,921

602
01:10:51,796 --> 01:10:56,676

like that, l guess you do.

603
01:11:11,817 --> 01:11:17,613

exactly the loquacious type, is he?

604
01:11:19,449 --> 01:11:23,161
ls that the kind of man
you need? Loquacious type?

605
01:11:24,913 --> 01:11:27,457
Fair point, Lieutenant.

606
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,503
So you all get in trouble in
there, what are we supposed to do?

607

608
01:11:36,007 --> 01:11:39,176

we can handle it.

609
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,597
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure

610

matter, escape from that basement.

idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?

613

She chose the spot.

614

615

994
02:06:42,185 --> 02:06:45,313
all I have to do is pick
up this phone right here,

995
02:06:45,398 --> 02:06:48,233
inform the cinema,
and your plan is kaput.

996
02:06:50,653 --> 02:06:55,864

still alive, and that's one big if,

going to take them boys

Yes, it will ruin the evening.

1001

very, very, very mad at you

for what you've done to his big night.

02:07:12,341 --> 02:07:14,634
But you won't get Hitler,
you won't get Goebbels,

1004
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:17,761
you won't get Goring,
and you won't get Bormann.

1005

And you need all four to end the war.

But if I don't pick up
this phone right here,

1007
02:07:25,354 --> 02:07:27,689
you may very well get all four.

1008
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:33,778
And if you get all four, you end the war

1009

02:07:37,658 --> 02:07:39,199

1011
02:07:39,909 --> 02:07:43,121
let's discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight.

1012
02:07:46,042 --> 02:07:47,876
So, the way I see it,

1013
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:52,171
since Hitler's death or possible
rescue rests solely on my reaction,

1014
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:54,423
if I do nothing,

1015
02:07:54,841 --> 02:07:57,551
it's as if I'm causing his
death even more than yourselves.

1016
02:07:57,636 --> 02:07:58,886
Wouldn't you agree?

1017
02:07:59,555 --> 02:08:00,889
I guess so.

1018
02:08:03,475 --> 02:08:05,476
How about you, Utivich?

1019
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:07,186
I guess so, too.

1020
02:08:12,734 --> 02:08:13,984
Gentlemen, l have no intention

1021
02:08:14,069 --> 02:08:17,154
of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels
and killing Goring and killing Bormann,

1022
02:08:17,238 --> 02:08:19,990
not to mention winning the war
single-handedly for the Allies,

1023
02:08:20,076 --> 02:08:23,828
only later to find myself
standing before a Jewish tribunal.

1024
02:08:25,914 --> 02:08:29,458
If you want to win the war tonight,

1025
02:08:31,087 --> 02:08:33,253
we have to make a deal.

1026
02:08:36,257 --> 02:08:38,009
What kind of deal?

1027
02:08:38,094 --> 02:08:40,636
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.

1028
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:45,265
However, I'm sure this mission
of yours has a commanding officer.

1029
02:08:46,268 --> 02:08:47,601
A general.

1030
02:08:48,270 --> 02:08:49,938
I'm betting for...

1031
02:08:51,649 --> 02:08:53,565

we? Yeah! Make a deal.

is a more than capable
radio operator named Hermann.

1040
02:09:24,806 --> 02:09:27,141

other end of that radio

pen to authorize my,

of my conditional surrender.

a story too good to be true,

02:14:06,671 --> 02:14:10,341

was part of Operation Kino
