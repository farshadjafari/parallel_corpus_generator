1
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:25,247
B-7

2
00:02:34,174 --> 00:02:36,003
G-46

3
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,770
Before the cops nabbed me, I stashed cash.

4
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:45,510
Millions.

5
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,408
Hey! Sit down!

6
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,742
Did you hear me? Millions!

7
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:52,361
Can't you see I'm on a roll here?

8
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,176
Come on, Penguin. Hear me out!

9
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:56,764
Ahem!

10
00:02:59,156 --> 00:03:01,081
Bingo! Hur..

11
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,737
N-17

12
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:10,140
It was thirty years in the slammer and

13
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:11,703
ten here in Arkham.
(Bingo!)

14
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:12,910
But the fact is,

15
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:16,600
I cannot take one more day in the cuckoo's nest.

16
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,970
I am willing to split the take 50-50,

17
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,744
if, you can get us out of here.

18
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,600
And where might we retrieve our little nest egg?

19
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:31,647
Gotham Cemetary, north end.

20
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,900
The crypt behind the tombstone with the cross.

21
00:03:35,943 --> 00:03:38,200
But I think I'll keep more specific directions

22
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,372
to myself until we get there.

23
00:03:40,372 --> 00:03:41,409
Together.

24
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:45,188
You don't have to worry about trusting me, old pal.

25
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:47,889
I'm as dependable as the dodo.

26
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,762
I knew you were rock solid, Penguin.

27
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:51,741
Not like that other guy.

28
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:54,500
You told someone else?

29
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,400
Well, first I went to the only one who's escaped

30
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,610
from here more times than you.

31
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,317
Who?

32
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:00,126
Take it easy!

33
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:01,950
I don't think he got what I was telling him.

34
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,173
Who, who, who??

35
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,300
I mean, talk about having a real screw loose, right?

36
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:10,123
You told him?

37
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,917
Joker! He's escaped!

38
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,039
Goodbye Arkham,

39
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:27,553
hello, Gotham!

40
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:37,154
That crook loop's got the step on me!

41
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,500
Come on, come on!

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,171
That means you!

43
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,356
Ooh, it's Joker!

44
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:44,857
Where?

45
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,997
Bingo.

46
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,951
Tweet, tweet.

47
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,148
Penguin, you old featherbrain.

48
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,600
What brings you out of Arkham?

49
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,347
Same as you, clowny.

50
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:57,900
But I think we can save each other a whole lot of

51
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,900
trouble if we agree to split the take.

52
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,032
See your point.

53
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,206
Partners?

54
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,572
My, Pengy. You really know how to shake!

55
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,352
Instant karma, Joker.

56
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,728
Don't get caught in the rain without your straitjacket.

57
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,563
Batsy, you're such a card.

58
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,002
Gotham Cemetary.

59
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
A casket, a casket

60
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,346
which crypt's got the money casket?

61
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,900
No sign.

62
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,706
Tombstone with a cross,

63
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:46,400
tombstone with a...

64
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,061
Catch!

65
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,310
Give it up.

66
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,028
This time I'm out for bloody, Batsy.

67
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,900
It's behind the cross.

68
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,683
This must be the place.

69
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,711
I'll take what's behind door number 1.

70
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,500
Whoa.

71
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,600
Like that will stop me.

72
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:01,722
Show me the money.

73
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,746
I'm bleeding!

74
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,032
This isn't paydirt, it's just dirt!

75
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,955
Where is that loot?!

76
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,452
What's that?

77
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,808
Show's over.

78
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,963
The show must go on.

79
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,108
You wouldn't leave your pal hanging,
now would you?

80
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Almost had you!

81
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,112
Bye bye, Batsy!

82
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,906
Hey! Cemetary's closed!

83
00:14:21,555 --> 00:14:24,181
That will do.

84
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,155
Looks like I'm the main course.

85
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,100
Dead guys don't do that!

86
00:14:58,126 --> 00:15:02,816
Not dead. Undead.

87
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,162
I think I need to unwet my pants.

88
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,400
I will require a human servant.

89
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,206
A sentinel to guard my coffin while I sleep.

90
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,554
You.

91
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,200
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

92
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,624
I'll have you know, Sir,

93
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
I am a Cobblepot.

94
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,773
And Cobblepots do not serve.

95
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,322
I'm Penguin, I'll be your server.

96
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,400
I shall darn that straight away, Sir.

97
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,223
Sir? You are brooding.

98
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,936
More so than usual.

99
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:21,712
Alfred.

100
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:24,331
Tonight, Joker met his demise.

101
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,700
And our old friend, Cobblepot?

102
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:33,247
Penguin's trail went completely cold.

103
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,835
I have been at rest for quite some time.

104
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,296
Transylvania has changed.

105
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:44,600
Oh, O Dark One,

106
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,416
you're not in Transylvania anymore.

107
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,135
This is Gotham City.

108
00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:00,000
Then if I am no longer in Transylvania,
near my castle,

109
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,600
it must be due to forces outside my control.

110
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,366
Events which occurred, following my death.

111
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,200
It seems, after I was vanquished,

112
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:21,661
my remains were relocated, far from Transylvania.

113
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,755
Very well.

114
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,323
Now take me on a tour of this Gotham,
native guide.

115
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,139
The night is young, and still I thirst.

116
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Wayne Industries feels an obligation

117
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,700
to remain committed to socially responsible programs.

118
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
A prime example would be

119
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,200
our work in the field of alternative energy sources.

120
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,600
Amazing.

121
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,250
Well, I like to think we're just doing our part.

122
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,710
I mean, you've been here nearly 40 minutes

123
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,513
and haven't bolted for the door.

124
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,400
My work sometimes calls me away.

125
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,300
Well Bruce,

126
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,400
I'm sure you can imagine

127
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,100
how four false starts at an interview

128
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,800
might make a reporter feel rejected.

129
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,500
Now I have a question for you, Vicki.

130
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,272
Shoot.

131
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,274
Where's your camera man?

132
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,310
I, uh, gave him the day off.

133
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:25,800
Figured that way,

134
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,600
Gotham TV News might have a better shot

135
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,300
at getting to know the real Bruce Wayne.

136
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,000
Gotham TV News, or

137
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
Vicki Vale?

138
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,000
Well, I'm not the one who

139
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,800
picked a restaurant with such a beautiful view.

140
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,200
I'm sorry, Vicki.

141
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,450
Would you believe,

142
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,983
I have to wrap this up.

143
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,300
That was professional, Vale.

144
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,760
No it's, it's not that.

145
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:57,400
I still have a ton of things
to prepare for the energy expo

146
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,300
at the mansion tomorrow night.
Why don't you come?

147
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,475
But my story airs tomorrow morning.

148
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:06,019
I meant as my date.

149
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,279
The tally of missing persons

150
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,960
has spiked dramatically in Gotham this past week.

151
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,400
With the Gotham PD no closer
to uncovering who or what

152
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,800
might be behind the mysterious
disappearances of these "Lost Ones",

153
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,600
a cloud of fear hangs over our city.

154
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,543
Gotham PD aren't the only ones who're baffled.

155
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,300
Might the missing Penguin be behind this?

156
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,600
No ransom demands, not his style.

157
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,300
And speaking of news,

158
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,458
how was your dinner with the lovely Vicki Vale?

159
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,400
Short, but sweet.

160
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,011
I invited her to the expo tomorrow night. And,

161
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:49,510
to dinner here, Saturday.

162
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,098
To think I was beginning to fear

163
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:53,224
you prefered the company of archvillains.

164
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,748
On that note,

165
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:58,457
let's see if tonight turns up

166
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:01,100
Penguin or any of these Lost Ones.

167
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,500
I lost Joker,

168
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,200
I'm not going to lose anyone else on my watch.

169
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,100
My purse!

170
00:20:57,277 --> 00:20:59,000
A rent-a-cop?

171
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:01,782
Whoa!

172
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,478
Oh thank goodness.

173
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,142
Guess I'm not needed.

174
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:25,650
Did you find my bag?

175
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,236
A man who dresses like a bat.

176
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,700
Oh phsaw.

177
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,500
The Batman may look the look,

178
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,123
but he has none of your mojo.

179
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,600
I am nonetheless intrigued.

180
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,528
My legacy has been quite influencial.

181
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,403
Vampires, Master Bruce?

182
00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:41,100
Are you certain

183
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,504
you're not suffering from sleep deprivation?

184
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:45,500
I don't want to believe it either, Alfred.

185
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,976
But I know what I saw.

186
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,430
Fangs.

187
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,859
Poppycock.

188
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:52,426
Easily purchased at any halloween superstore.

189
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:54,827
It wasn't just the teeth.

190
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,827
The way they moved, their eyes.

191
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,800
They weren't human.

192
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,300
Yes. Well, might I remind you

193
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,863
before one urban legend

194
00:24:03,938 --> 00:24:05,803
becomes too obsessed with another,

195
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,700
you are hosting the Wayne Industries

196
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,661
energy expo here, tonight.

197
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:14,400
With the ravishing Vicki Vale on your arm.

198
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,914
Time for my master to rise and shine.

199
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,700
Wakey-wake, it's nighty-night!

200
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,621
You have places to be, people to bite.

201
00:24:50,128 --> 00:24:55,100
Those bloodshakes really work wonders
for your complexion.

202
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,915
Rise, my children of the night.

203
00:24:57,975 --> 00:25:01,330
We shall take Gotham, human by human.

204
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:04,100
Until our blood flows through its canals,

205
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:10,685
transfiguring it into the city of the undead.

206
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,272
As you execute my dark purpose,

207
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:18,617
I shall stake my claim among Gotham's elite.

208
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
Well if you're looking to be numero uno

209
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,215
of the rich and famous,

210
00:25:22,261 --> 00:25:26,434
there's one bird you'll have to knock off its perch.

211
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,700
You there,

212
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,400
more napkins at the buffet.

213
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,067
You, attend to the spill in the study.

214
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:13,209
And you, Stipes,

215
00:26:13,717 --> 00:26:15,700
I realise this assignment may not be

216
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,565
as big a priority to you as catching your next wave,

217
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,478
but would you mind tucking in your shirt?

218
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,043
Dude, come on, chill.

219
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,122
Caviar chills.

220
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,000
Alfred Pennyworth, serving captain,

221
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,569
does nothing of the sort.

222
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,189
Truly magnificent.

223
00:26:46,532 --> 00:26:48,099
Oh, my necklace?

224
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:49,799
It's a family heirloom.

225
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,909
And you are?

226
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:56,153
Alucard. Doctor Alucard.

227
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:57,629
Bruce Wayne.

228
00:26:57,704 --> 00:26:59,614
I don't believe we've met.

229
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:01,036
I am new to Gotham,

230
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:03,906
a recent transport from Eastern Europe.

231
00:27:03,981 --> 00:27:05,880
Really? What line of work are you in?

232
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:07,613
Cultural anthropology.

233
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,413
I am here to study your city's Batman.

234
00:27:11,484 --> 00:27:13,300
Our city's?

235
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,968
You mean to tell me Budapest has a Dark Knight too?

236
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:18,706
Rare instances have been documented

237
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:21,577
of a man who assumes the likeness of a bat,

238
00:27:21,627 --> 00:27:25,004
in societies ancient as well as modern.

239
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,493
And I believe,

240
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,231
that while instilling fear by night,

241
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:35,279
these beings cloak themselves as
normal members of society.

242
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:36,820
Fascinating theory.

243
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,700
Bats are fascinating creatures.

244
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,059
As are you, Doctor.

245
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:45,704
If you'll excuse us, we've got to circulate.

246
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,977
Hmm, seems you've picked up
that he's my type, huh?

247
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:51,100
Tall, dark, and weird?

248
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,900
We spoke of my work, what of yours?

249
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,998
Research and development.

250
00:27:59,128 --> 00:28:02,546
For instance, the Wayne Industries' SL5.

251
00:28:02,621 --> 00:28:04,695
It's the most efficient technology to date

252
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:09,100
for collecting solar energy,
and storing it as true sunlight.

253
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,100
It's about time science did something
positive with the sun.

254
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,531
Hors d'œuvre?

255
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,135
Beef steak tartare, exquisite.

256
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,304
I prefer my meat cooked.

257
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:34,267
Some garlic shrimp?

258
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,703
But you must, it really packs a punch.

259
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,200
Please excuse me,

260
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,984
I must find something with which to wash this down.

261
00:28:57,676 --> 00:29:00,760
Bruce? Are you alright?

262
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,303
I'll be right back.

263
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:04,820
There's something I need to attend to.

264
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,200
Master Bruce.

265
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,731
I know the night is terribly alluring to you,

266
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:40,552
but Miss Vale is waiting for you.

267
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:46,000
Sir! Is everything alright?

268
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,825
Alfred?

269
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:50,358
I don't remember how I got out here.

270
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,389
Alucard.

271
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:57,710
Sir?

272
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,693
Master Bruce?

273
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,992
You freaked me out.

274
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,880
Looking for some munchies?

275
00:30:38,328 --> 00:30:42,366
You there. Circulate!

276
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,835
Empty-handed?

277
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,554
This time I am out for blood.

278
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,050
Stipes! Mister Stipes.

279
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,800
Now what is wrong with this picture?

280
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,000
Correct. No cheese platter.

281
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,900
Which means you are headed the wrong way.

282
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,100
And look at yourself.

283
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,109
Was I not clear the first... Oh dear.

284
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:16,308
Oh, leaving before desert?

285
00:31:19,436 --> 00:31:21,070
I have had my fill.

286
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:22,704
Though not of you.

287
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:25,191
When might I see you again?

288
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,350
Tomorrow morning.

289
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,454
On Gotham TV News.

290
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:32,672
Phew. Dodged that bullet.

291
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:35,056
Sorry Vicki, I'll be right back.

292
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:52,287
Master Bruce!

293
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:55,595
The mirror, he had no reflection!

294
00:31:57,078 --> 00:31:58,548
Sir, did you hear me?

295
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:02,111
Pardon me. Thanks.

296
00:32:06,818 --> 00:32:08,017
Whatever are you writing?

297
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:09,632
His name.

298
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,572
Alucard.

299
00:32:22,785 --> 00:32:23,699
So it would seem

300
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:27,000
Gotham is not merely being visited by vampires-

301
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:29,834
But the king of all vampires.

302
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:32,441
Count Dracula.

303
00:32:34,435 --> 00:32:35,267
On the bright side,

304
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:37,859
no corpses drained of blood have turned up.

305
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,634
Which means Dracula hasn't slained anyone.

306
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,687
Yet.

307
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,662
And the dark side?

308
00:32:44,114 --> 00:32:46,314
If each of the lost ones in turn feeds on others-

309
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,296
Their numbers will grow exponentially.

310
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,231
Into an army of vampires.

311
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:54,506
Stopping Dracula won't be enough.

312
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,250
I need to rescue his victims.

313
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,010
All of them.

314
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,078
Before Gotham has a plague in its hands.

315
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:02,420
Rescue vampires, Sir?

316
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,200
Vampirism may be rooted in the supernatural,

317
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,800
but it infects blood.

318
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,550
And if it's transmitted like a disease,

319
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,800
there's a chance it can be treated.

320
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,829
We have the advantage

321
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:17,688
of the largest old-school medical library in Gotham.

322
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:20,359
Right here, under our roof.

323
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:23,300
Yes. And it's always an honor

324
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,950
to hunt for knowledge.

325
00:33:24,971 --> 00:33:27,059
Especially when it is courtesy

326
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:29,309
of Doctor Thomas Wayne.

327
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:38,654
What is it about you that keeps me coming back?

328
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:43,406
Your boyish charm, hot bod, tons of money?

329
00:33:43,695 --> 00:33:45,717
If only I were shallow.

330
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:51,385
There's something deeper,
bubbling below your surface.

331
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,000
It's not hard to imagine

332
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,200
why you're out to save the world
with science and all your charities.

333
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,048
The question is,

334
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:01,190
when will you let someone rescue you?

335
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:09,944
Vicki Vale.

336
00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:12,953
What?

337
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:15,037
I'm on my way.

338
00:34:18,994 --> 00:34:22,484
We just received exclusive
breaking news on the lost ones.

339
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,126
Vicki Vale is live on the scene

340
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:26,299
at downtown Gotham; here's her report.

341
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:27,067
Fancy that.

342
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:29,250
Two night owls on the same case.

343
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,994
You are meant for each other.

344
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:36,340
It seems Gotham PD may have new
information regarding

345
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,195
the mysterious disappearances.

346
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:41,180
Thanks to an eye witness who has this to say.

347
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,852
I saw what got the guy.

348
00:34:42,852 --> 00:34:44,624
Saw it with my own two eyes.

349
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,400
It was a bat.

350
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,426
I saw a huge shadow of a bat-

351
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:53,446
As such, Gotham PD has concluded that perpetrator

352
00:34:53,446 --> 00:34:56,642
behind these bizarre abductions is none other than

353
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:58,277
the Batman.

354
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:03,661
Well this could put a kink in the relationship.

355
00:35:11,438 --> 00:35:14,182
It's way past your bedtime, Sir.

356
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,602
With more citizens vanishing every night,

357
00:35:16,652 --> 00:35:19,200
all we know is that the shadow of the bat

358
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:22,200
now strikes fear not only in criminals,

359
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,830
but in the hearts of all Gothamites.

360
00:35:25,353 --> 00:35:30,651
Mighty gracious of the Batman
to take all the blame for you.

361
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:32,282
Sucker!

362
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:41,386
You like? It's a plasma screen.

363
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:43,480
You know, as in blood?

364
00:35:46,636 --> 00:35:48,025
Oh, the girl.

365
00:35:48,468 --> 00:35:52,700
You have been in the grave a long time, Master.

366
00:35:53,226 --> 00:35:55,666
Nice jugulars.

367
00:35:55,930 --> 00:36:01,356
Even her name possesses a mysterious allure.

368
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:03,222
Vale.

369
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:08,115
I think it's time to seek my bride.

370
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,301
One of the first to vanish was a night watchman.

371
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,206
At Gotham Cemetary.

372
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,091
That seems as good a place as any
to catch a vampire.

373
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:27,400
And do know that the windows and doors
of Wayne Mansion are not

374
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,169
the only objects I enhanced with garlic.

375
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,045
It's him. The Batman.

376
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:52,096
Please, hurry. I don't want to be a lost one.

377
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:53,900
Attention all SWAT units.

378
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,704
We have a Batman sighting in the
vincinity of Gotham Cemetary.

379
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,399
Graveyards may not wash.

380
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:15,962
Not if vampires have an aversion to crosses.

381
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,500
So the folk tales are true.

382
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,500
There is another bat in Gotham.

383
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,114
Count Dracula, I presume.

384
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:36,718
A legend, you are apparently intimate with.

385
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:38,413
Don't flatter yourself.

386
00:39:38,413 --> 00:39:40,935
We cast kindred shadows,

387
00:39:40,935 --> 00:39:42,701
have you not seen the news?

388
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:44,110
I don't harm people.

389
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,510
You have no concept of the harm

390
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:50,676
of which I am capable,
if only because I really hate

391
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:56,494
to waste a life when it can be
spent in servitude to me.

392
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,900
Life, or living death?

393
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,603
To become vampire,

394
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:03,600
is to heighten all of one's senses.

395
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,000
To attain speed, strength, and immortality.

396
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,194
Dripping with garlic.

397
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,842
I shall most certainly steer clear of those.

398
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,127
Try as you may, you cannot outbat me.

399
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,824
Join me, Batman.

400
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,189
Join my legion of the undead.

401
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:51,821
Not interested.

402
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,987
Then I thank you for keeping my legacy alive
in my absence.

403
00:42:00,987 --> 00:42:06,343
But now there is only room
for one Batman in Gotham.

404
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,730
You spurned my offer of eternal life.

405
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,630
The next time, we do not part

406
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,818
until maggots feed upon your flesh.

407
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,337
Al-fred...

408
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,241
Oh dear.

409
00:43:57,755 --> 00:43:59,488
You!

410
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,110
Only a dream, Master Bruce.

411
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,582
Wish I could say the same about last night.

412
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,765
Dracula's stronger than the Batman in every way.

413
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,436
Physically, mentally.

414
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,600
I'm even being swallowed up by his legend.

415
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,332
Sir?

416
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,962
The more the Batman tries to protect Gotham,

417
00:44:33,262 --> 00:44:35,462
the more Gotham fears him.

418
00:44:35,962 --> 00:44:39,299
As if he were the son of Dracula.

419
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,400
Mustn't wake Master too early,

420
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,091
doesn't like the sun in his eyes.

421
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:51,818
Mustn't be late, he'll be hungry and cranky.

422
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,100
Hmm. Almost dark.

423
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,900
Huh, what?

424
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,911
You!

425
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,400
Everyone's so shocked to see me these days.

426
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,713
You, the fisherman who found me tangled in his net.

427
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:19,525
By the way, who knew electroshock therapy
could be so invigorating?

428
00:45:19,725 --> 00:45:21,462
But that's all water under the bridge,

429
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:24,667
cause Joker's back from the grave.

430
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:27,428
Yeah, a lot of that going around.

431
00:45:27,924 --> 00:45:29,917
Speaking of graves, Penggy,

432
00:45:30,217 --> 00:45:32,737
might you be hiding buried treasure?

433
00:45:32,737 --> 00:45:35,133
No! There's nothing in there!

434
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,256
Thought we were partners!

435
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,289
Some hideout you got here, Penggy!

436
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,900
Dripping with atmosphere.

437
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,954
I'm warning you Joker!

438
00:45:52,154 --> 00:45:54,600
There's nothing here for you!

439
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,965
Ooooh, that is one fat looking vault.

440
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,674
No, Joker!

441
00:46:21,074 --> 00:46:24,450
That's one good looking corpse.

442
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,401
Breakfast in bed, fresh squeezed.

443
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,196
You, want to give blood?

444
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,141
A break-in at the bank.

445
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:15,400
As you have more apocalyptic matters to attend to,

446
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,265
might you be leaving this one to the police?

447
00:47:18,265 --> 00:47:20,679
It's a blood bank.

448
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:41,737
A bold finish of wild cherries, with a hint of oak.

449
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,508
Joker?

450
00:48:34,608 --> 00:48:37,010
Undead and kicking!

451
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,900
Funny, you're my second Batman tonight!

452
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,971
And you're both pains in the neck!

453
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,900
Batman, you're one dead duck!

454
00:49:06,134 --> 00:49:07,295
Garlic.

455
00:49:07,295 --> 00:49:09,100
Eww.

456
00:50:23,152 --> 00:50:24,300
Sir?

457
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,341
Your garlic bombs did the trick.

458
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,178
We have our test subject.

459
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:55,396
Anything, Sir?

460
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,617
Joker's not talking.

461
00:50:56,617 --> 00:50:59,001
He won't reveal Dracula's resting place,

462
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:02,544
not so long as he has vampire blood in his veins.

463
00:51:02,544 --> 00:51:04,900
Batsy!!

464
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,300
Joker has suffered a fate crueler than death.

465
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,336
I intend to bring him back to the land of the living.

466
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:14,547
With a little blood work.

467
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,500
Hey little girl. You shouldn't be out here.

468
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,500
Solar generator prepped and ready, Sir.

469
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:20,850
Joker's blood didn't withstand the sunlight.

470
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:53,300
I know you're near, Batsy.

471
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:58,102
I can smell the precious nectar pumping
through your veins.

472
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,200
Find anything of value?

473
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,500
To be quite honest, so much vampire lore exists,

474
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,853
that it is difficult to separate fact from fiction.

475
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,800
Carmilla Karnstein, the bride of Count Dracula.

476
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,652
According to legend,
her bloodthirst rivalled even his own.

477
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,400
It seems they were-

478
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,200
Meant for each other?

479
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,600
If Cupid's arrow could penetrate a heart so black,

480
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,200
there may be hope for you yet, Master Bruce.

481
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,814
Miss Vale.

482
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:39,770
It's Saturday night.

483
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,976
The dinner!

484
00:54:40,976 --> 00:54:44,700
I completely forgot with all of this
blood sucking nastiness about.

485
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:51,373
The horror! The horror!

486
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,706
Tell her I'm running late.

487
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,967
Coming!

488
00:55:10,305 --> 00:55:13,937
Miss Vale. Please, do come in.

489
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,439
Why do you torment me, Batsy?

490
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,922
I thought you cared.

491
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,350
Trust me Joker, I'm trying to help you.

492
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:29,056
Then feed me!

493
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,100
Got ketchup?

494
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,900
The grief must continue to affect Bruce.

495
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,500
I mean, no one ever really gets over
a trauma like that.

496
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,667
Master Bruce has his outlets.

497
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,580
He must fear losing those he cares about.

498
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,772
Which would explain his difficulty
in letting people get close.

499
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:04,253
You have been most patient, Miss Vale.

500
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,800
Do I smell garlic?

501
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,046
Uh, that would be dinner.

502
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,807
He isn't coming, is he?

503
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,744
Thirsty. Burning up inside.

504
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,500
I can't take it anymore!

505
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:55,305
Have mercy on a sad clown.

506
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,810
Dracula's resting place, where is it?

507
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,400
Don't you see?

508
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,115
The choice isn't mine to make.

509
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,287
I am his vessel.

510
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:31,330
Batsy, you complete me.

511
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,002
Stable.

512
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:14,426
Vicki.

513
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,757
Astonishingly, she still speaks the world of you.

514
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:33,024
Lunch.

515
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,900
It's about time, Batsy.

516
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,585
You're late!

517
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,223
Taste's a little off.

518
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,524
You sure this is fresh?

519
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,300
No games, Joker.

520
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,014
Where's Dracula?

521
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,748
I'm looking at him.

522
00:59:12,843 --> 00:59:14,700
Where's Penguin?
Penguin?

523
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,228
Where's Gotham Cemetary?
Cemetary.

524
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:20,017
Am I.. am I dreaming?

525
00:59:20,017 --> 00:59:22,802
No, just insane.

526
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:26,254
Which is why you're going back to Arkham.

527
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,239
The cure had an interesting side effect.

528
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:35,100
It seems when vampirism leaves one's system,

529
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,935
so does the victim's memory of it.

530
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,811
Perhaps for the better, Sir.

531
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:43,298
After all, Gotham can barely
accept the legend of the Batman.

532
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:46,590
However will they deal with the truth about Dracula?

533
00:59:46,675 --> 00:59:49,797
Hopefully that won't be an issue after tonight.

534
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,389
Dracula's holed up in Gotham Cemetary,

535
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,803
where I intend to bury him.

536
00:59:56,919 --> 00:59:58,250
Permanently.

537
00:59:58,636 --> 00:59:59,906
Begging pardon, Sir.

538
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:03,528
You think your magic bullet may actually
destroy Dracula?

539
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,488
Dracula may walk like a man,

540
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,796
but he's a monster.

541
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,355
Wait, wait up! Wait!

542
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,400
Miss Vale.

543
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,600
Doctor Alucard.

544
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:39,000
Now you of all people should know better, Miss Vale.

545
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,800
Alone at night?

546
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,500
Yeah I know. The lost ones.

547
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,510
I wasn't planning on missing my train.

548
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,900
It may be some time before the next one arrives.

549
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,896
Would you like to join me? For a drink?

550
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,741
Uh, thank you, but I'm running late.

551
01:00:54,837 --> 01:00:57,110
So I'll catch a cab.

552
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,839
Have a good night, Doctor.

553
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,200
Sorry Vicki.

554
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,360
Tonight, I have a date with Dracula.

555
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,199
You have reached Wayne Mansion.
Please leave a message at the tone.

556
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:45,938
Master Bruce, I know you are eager
to put an end to this reign of terror,

557
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:49,390
but would it not be more prudent
to wait until sunrise?

558
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,400
If you cannot guarantee your victory, Sir-

559
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,622
Gotham loses.

560
01:01:55,657 --> 01:01:57,300
I'll need every advantage.

561
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:01,200
And for once it is a big morning that
the Batman has ahead of him.

562
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,686
Do get some rest.

563
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,871
After returning Vicki's call.

564
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,288
She's not picking up.

565
01:02:18,308 --> 01:02:19,591
Sir?

566
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,581
Vicki.

567
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,800
Hi Bruce. It's Vicki.

568
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,074
You won't believe who I just bumped into.

569
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,000
Tall dark and weird? Oh, well.

570
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,300
I was hoping you might be around to rescue me-

571
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:44,400
Sir, it is many hours before daybreak.

572
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,215
I think Vicki's been patient enough.

573
01:02:47,852 --> 01:02:49,313
Right then.

574
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,700
My children of the night.
Gather witness.

575
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,182
The blood wedding.

576
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,500
Vicki Vampira Vale.

577
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,300
So what do we call her? Mrs Dracula?

578
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,412
You misunderstand, Penguin.

579
01:03:46,412 --> 01:03:50,600
Miss Vale lacks the bite I require in a mate.

580
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,355
Meet my true bride.

581
01:04:03,099 --> 01:04:05,560
But she's-
Ashes?

582
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,307
Carmilla suffered the fate of immolation by sunlight.

583
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,197
An almost permanent death.

584
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,633
Mere blood cannot repair her,
as it would have punctured her heart.

585
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,200
To resurrect my bride,

586
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:33,405
she must feed upon the very essence of life itself.

587
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:38,025
Master, take my soul.

588
01:04:48,441 --> 01:04:49,998
Joker's footprints.

589
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,200
So this is how Dracula bypassed the crosses.

590
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:12,400
I once tapped into these long forgotten catacombs.

591
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,717
Apparently so did he.

592
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,849
An unwanted guest.

593
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,800
The... lost ones?

594
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,050
Where are we?

595
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:14,084
I don't know,
but let's get everyone out of here.

596
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,473
You dare interrupt the ceremony.

597
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:04,138
You cannot win.
No human can resist my will.

598
01:09:12,006 --> 01:09:13,550
Good boy.

599
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,300
Once my bride has had her fill,

600
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:22,542
I shall offer up your corpse as a wedding gift.

601
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,742
My bride!

602
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,899
Batman?

603
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:39,624
If my bride cannot have your soul, Vicki Vale,
I shall have your blood!

604
01:10:39,715 --> 01:10:41,311
Run!

605
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,412
Go!

606
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,912
Maybe you didn't hear,
Master's not through with you!

607
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,392
It's scarcely midnight, Batman.

608
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:17,136
Sunrise will not help you this time.

609
01:11:57,621 --> 01:12:03,950
No need to see you, Batman, I can smell your blood.

610
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:18,142
Master Bruce is triangulating his location,
from within the catacombs?

611
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,541
Come here!

612
01:14:07,298 --> 01:14:10,579
I do hope this is a positive turn.

613
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,547
Count Dracula!

614
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,387
I will drain you dry,
and use your cape as a dinner napkin.

615
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,572
Oh dear.

616
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:47,532
Now where did you disappear to, my pretty?

617
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,480
Knock knock.

618
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:57,920
Here's Ozzy!

619
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:33,178
Impressive dwelling.
It shall be your tomb.

620
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,848
Bite this!

621
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:02,700
You may have cured
my human victims of their disease,

622
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:08,483
but no earthly medicine can cure
a supernatural affliction.

623
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,678
Go on, run.

624
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:32,600
I am beyond human, Batman.
I am evil incarnate. I am the prince of-

625
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,126
Darkness?

626
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,300
Rise and shine.

627
01:17:54,138 --> 01:17:57,709
You are... Bruce Wayne.

628
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,109
I'm the Batman.

629
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,923
And you're dust.

630
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,864
I shall sweep that into the dustbin, straightaway.

631
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:47,300
Soon Master will... drink your uh, blood and stuff-

632
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:51,505
What am I talking about? Huh?

633
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:55,920
Treasure!

634
01:18:56,355 --> 01:18:58,924
That's what I'm talking about!

635
01:18:59,264 --> 01:19:01,324
Freeze!

636
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,314
Tonight, Gotham breathes a sigh of relief.

637
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,720
The lost ones have been found.

638
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,600
It seems Penguin was behind the bizarre plot

639
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,348
to use the hostages to recover
a missing mob treasure.

640
01:19:21,348 --> 01:19:25,300
Though details remain sketchy due to
amnesia inflicted on the hostages,

641
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,940
apparently via some sort of hypnosis.

642
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:30,214
But the hostages are safe and sound.

643
01:19:30,214 --> 01:19:34,639
And it now seems that the Batman was
unfairly blamed for Penguin's crimes.

644
01:19:34,639 --> 01:19:39,800
So it is safe to say we can swap
his status from villain back to vigilante.

645
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:44,000
It was vampires I tell you, vampires!

646
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,073
With big honking fangs.

647
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:52,568
Good thing they've kept Penguin's pet
at Nest Warm back at Arkham Asylum.

648
01:19:53,036 --> 01:19:54,567
Now here's a twist.

649
01:19:54,567 --> 01:19:58,830
Instead of covering the news,
reporter Vicki Vale has become it.

650
01:19:58,865 --> 01:20:00,917
See any vampires, Vicki?

651
01:20:03,055 --> 01:20:05,055
Just bats.
