1
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,372
Willie Grimes reprimanded
and ready for the...

2
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,212
Go on, get out of it.

3
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,160
I thought I'd remain sober for the day.

4
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,120
Oh, that's sharp.

5
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,120
That's a very close shave, indeed.

6
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,891
I've changed my mind.

7
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,331
I'll be off, then.

8
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,371
I've an appointment
with Oswald Mitchells.

9
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,291
I've changed my mind.

10
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,691
Little buggers.

11
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,759
You bastards.

12
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,211
Serve that blade up, mate.

13
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,091
I don't think it's quite my size.

14
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,006
It's a little tight around the neck.

15
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:02,451
Lop his bleedin' head off.

16
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,171
I'll see you in hell, you bollocks.

17
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,086
Fuck you, Grimes.

18
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,159
As for you.

19
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:20,078
In the basket.

20
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:48,970
Father.

21
00:03:49,118 --> 00:03:50,009
Thank God.

22
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:51,957
Ow!

23
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:56,169
I didn't do anything.

24
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,077
Get me out of this thing.

25
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:01,927
Mr. Blake.

26
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:02,995
Mr. Arthur Blake.

27
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:05,115
Yes.

28
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:07,847
Body snatching.

29
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:09,155
Hmm.

30
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:16,167
It is my duty to write, for
the purpose of announcement

31
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:19,767
and later for printing,
your final words.

32
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:24,847
Eh, so that others drawn
to the wayside may, uh...

33
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:28,682
take heed in your cries of
guilt and pleas for forgiveness.

34
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,766
It is also my duty to inform you

35
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:34,886
that you are to be
executed by way of, uh...

36
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,114
beheading.

37
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:39,366
For a lifetime spent in
the despicable pursuit

38
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:40,794
of grave robbing and murder...

39
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:44,366
Well, all this really means
is that you're a dead man,

40
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:47,554
and I'm here to make you say sorry.

41
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:50,246
You'd be after my
gallows speech, then.

42
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:53,246
By hook or by crook.

43
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,646
Did you get a speech
out of old Willie

44
00:05:54,794 --> 00:05:55,834
before they chopped off his head?

45
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:59,126
It would have been nice to
have a chat with your friend,

46
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,001
maybe extrapolate a
story or two from him,

47
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:05,233
but, well, sadly, that was not to be.

48
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:09,473
Do you have anything to say
for yourself before they, uh...

49
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:14,645
Well, I suppose you
wouldn't believe me

50
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:15,685
if I told you I was innocent.

51
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,285
Innocent?

52
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,845
Of murder, that is.

53
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:22,405
The despicable grave robbing
part sounds about right.

54
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:23,365
Well, that's a new one.

55
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,800
Why don't I have a chat
with the executioner

56
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:27,285
and may... maybe get you a pardon, like?

57
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:29,125
All I know is this.

58
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:31,045
I woke up in the morning,
the coppers were at my door.

59
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:32,165
And get this.

60
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:34,125
They followed a fresh
trail of body parts

61
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:38,484
that led all the way from
the station to my house.

62
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:39,484
As if I'd be that stupid.

63
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,004
The same thing happened to Willie.

64
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,879
Fresh trail of body
parts that led all the way

65
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:45,924
from the station to his doorstep.

66
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,324
And then they called us murderers.

67
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:48,404
Bollocks.

68
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:49,444
We were set up.

69
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,044
Not a murderer, then.

70
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:52,044
Nope.

71
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,244
- Grave robber?
- Yep.

72
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:55,044
Bloody good one too.

73
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,324
Would you mind shining a light

74
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:59,204
on what it was that
made you so exceptional?

75
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,959
I'm not sure I want to
go down that road, Father.

76
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:05,124
You know, when I look
back on it now, it seems...

77
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:08,964
Well, I'm not sure you
would believe a word of it.

78
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,643
Besides, I have a terrible memory.

79
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,431
Eh, you'd be surprised what a
man of the cloth might believe.

80
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:23,311
You think this might
help with your memory?

81
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:28,631
It... it might.

82
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:33,243
Here's to the late, great Willie Grimes.

83
00:07:33,391 --> 00:07:37,123
Oh, you'll be seeing him
very soon, Mr. Blake, very soon.

84
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:39,723
Aye, that I will.

85
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:42,403
I suppose we have some
time to kill, Father?

86
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:44,002
Eh, Francis Duffy.

87
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,322
Father Francis Duffy.

88
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,322
And you have exactly five hours to kill.

89
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,482
I'll tell you what, Father.

90
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,002
You keep this whiskey here flowing,

91
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,362
we'll have ourselves a little chat.

92
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,590
Well, that's a fair trade then.

93
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,082
So tell me,

94
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,162
how did you start out
in your life of crime?

95
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,402
Well, I suppose I'd
have to go back a bit,

96
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,670
back to when I first met Willie.

97
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,522
Willie got me into the trade.

98
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,602
I was his apprentice.

99
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,522
You see, it was body
snatching or the streets for me

100
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,670
and my ma, my little brother.

101
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:29,161
Are you frightened?

102
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,281
Of course you is.

103
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:33,561
I remember the first job I pulled.

104
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:36,121
Nearly shit myself, didn't I?

105
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:39,041
With me old man it was.

106
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:41,109
Miserable bastard.

107
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,109
So what brought you down
to the Fortune of War, then?

108
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:51,680
My mom told me to go
there and talk to Ronnie.

109
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:53,160
When I got there, he gave me an ale

110
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,840
and said I was gonna
meet you here tonight.

111
00:08:55,988 --> 00:08:57,200
You might keep me on.

112
00:08:57,348 --> 00:08:58,520
Who's your Ma, then?

113
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,280
Mary Blake.

114
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:02,720
She works down at the food lane.

115
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:04,840
Selling things.

116
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:07,280
Ah, things.

117
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:08,480
If I can get a job,

118
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,640
she says she could stay
home with me little brother.

119
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:13,668
He's only a baby.

120
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:19,908
Fucking single grave, isn't it?

121
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:27,187
Now, you watch old Willie
and see how the job gets done.

122
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:34,879
You want that hole narrow.

123
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:37,107
Don't make it too wide neither.

124
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:12,318
Now, what I want for
you is to get down there

125
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:15,998
and smack a hole in the lid of that box.

126
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:16,958
The coffin?

127
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:18,038
Yeah, the coffin.

128
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:21,266
Come on now, boy, get on with it.

129
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,077
You done yet?

130
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,357
Me hands are bleeding.

131
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:52,677
Oh, give it some.

132
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:55,305
Don't stop till you hack through it.

133
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:03,476
I'm going to be sick.

134
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:06,304
Now stomp on the lid a
bit so's you can reach in.

135
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:12,676
What you want to do
is, you take this rope,

136
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:15,224
tie it round to whatever
it is that's down there.

137
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:21,876
Good lad.

138
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:24,624
All right, now get out of
it while I take a butchers.

139
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:34,544
Wow, that's some tight hold on that.

140
00:11:48,463 --> 00:11:51,235
Give us a hand with this shroud.

141
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:53,395
See, that's the one thing we don't take.

142
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:55,663
You could be done for nicking that.

143
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,675
You don't know her, do ya?

144
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,835
Well, do ya?

145
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:06,915
It was Mrs. Tulley.

146
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,755
She lives around from me Ma.

147
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:10,182
Well, not anymore she doesn't.

148
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:13,834
You'll be wanting a stronger stomach

149
00:12:13,982 --> 00:12:17,062
if you're gonna get into this
line of business, you would.

150
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,754
Which way now?

151
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:28,022
Here, boy.

152
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,022
You deserve a drink.

153
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:34,434
What is it?

154
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:38,034
It's good stuff...

155
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:40,994
and you've earned it.

156
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:42,713
Now take some.

157
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,153
Oop.

158
00:12:44,301 --> 00:12:46,341
Get that for me, will you?

159
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:58,021
I found it.

160
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:04,473
Why did he not strike you down?

161
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:07,113
He didn't have the heart, Father.

162
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:09,113
Like I said, Willie wasn't a murderer.

163
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:11,548
You know, underneath
all that dirt and grime,

164
00:13:11,696 --> 00:13:14,193
you'll find more dirt and grime,

165
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:16,152
and then underneath all that,

166
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,072
you'll find that Willie
has a heart of gold.

167
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,152
Had, Mr. Blake.

168
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,952
Had a heart of gold.

169
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,980
Your friend is no longer with us.

170
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,152
Oh, yeah, had a heart of gold.

171
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,752
Mm-hmm.

172
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,112
So he took me on as his apprentice,

173
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,112
and for better or worse,

174
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,872
that was the start of my life of crime.

175
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,312
And how long did you
remain under his employ?

176
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,392
On and off over the years.

177
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,152
Sometimes I employed him.

178
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,380
Mainly though we were under the
thumb of one Dr. Vernon Quint.

179
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,792
Quint.

180
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,671
Yeah, he was a fiend.

181
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,151
Had Willie and I slaving for years,

182
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,071
blackmailing us with the law
if we didn't deliver the goods.

183
00:13:56,219 --> 00:14:00,231
And he had you ransacking
the graveyards for him, eh?

184
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:02,111
Were you free to snatch as you pleased?

185
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,191
Not really.

186
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:05,271
I mean, the coppers could be
bought off from time to time,

187
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,711
but the relatives,
they were out for blood.

188
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:11,179
We had to think on our feet,
look elsewhere for corpses.

189
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:21,339
Go on, give her a little poke.

190
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,070
She had a wooden leg,
hollow in the middle.

191
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:29,590
She used to tie it with a
string and play it like a fiddle.

192
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:33,070
She'd fiddle in the hall;
she'd fiddle in the alleyway.

193
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:37,305
She didn't give a damn, for
she had to fiddle anyway.

194
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:38,590
Here you go lads, get them into you.

195
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:39,590
Oh, yeah, very good.

196
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:41,430
Thanks, Maisey, here's to Kathleen.

197
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:43,070
Lord have mercy on her soul.

198
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:44,190
A hard life.

199
00:14:44,338 --> 00:14:46,110
Some would say she's
off to a better place.

200
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,670
Hard life?

201
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,670
Hard living more like.

202
00:14:49,818 --> 00:14:53,710
Ah, but look at the beautiful
corpse she left behind.

203
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,509
It was the pleurisy got her in the end.

204
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:58,949
Expecting many guests, Maisey?

205
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:01,709
No, she didn't leave many
friends behind her, Tommy,

206
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:04,189
and we couldn't afford
the O'Casey mourners.

207
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,497
Terribly expensive.

208
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,949
Oh.

209
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:09,469
Excuse me, gentlemen.

210
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,137
Maybe I spoke too soon.

211
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:14,549
Friends indeed.

212
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:15,749
You're only here for the drink.

213
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:16,749
Feck off, you.

214
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:17,789
She was an awful woman.

215
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:19,137
An old whore, if you ask me.

216
00:15:22,057 --> 00:15:23,749
Now, lads, this is Arthur.

217
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:25,549
Kathleen's sister's son.

218
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:26,549
Oh.

219
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:27,829
She was a lovely woman, son.

220
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:30,028
A terrible day, son.

221
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:33,148
Me ma sends her love.

222
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:35,308
Would you like a cup of tea, dear?

223
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:36,948
Can I see me auntie?

224
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:38,423
Go ahead, son.

225
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,456
Sure she's only just asleep.

226
00:15:42,696 --> 00:15:45,908
Asleep with the Lord.

227
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:47,228
Dead.

228
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:49,336
She's dead, son.

229
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,536
Dead.

230
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,467
Ah, there now, son, save your tears.

231
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:08,822
Sure she's at rest now.

232
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,547
Oh, there, there.

233
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:14,147
I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

234
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:16,067
Sure I'll have one if
there is one going, Maisey.

235
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:18,227
There's that cake too, Maisey.

236
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,347
Go on, go on, son.

237
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,107
Let it out of you.

238
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:24,187
Can I have a minute alone with her...

239
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:25,947
to say good-bye?

240
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:28,027
I want to whisper her a prayer.

241
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:30,535
So she'll get to the Lord sooner.

242
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:32,547
Come on.

243
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:34,227
Let... let's leave the
boy alone with his aunt.

244
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,507
You two can help me in the pantry.

245
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:37,094
We'll fix you a nice cup of tea, son.

246
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:40,734
I'll only be a minute.

247
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:01,546
Open the door, son.

248
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:02,546
I think he's locked us in.

249
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:04,306
The little bastard's snuffin' her.

250
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:06,261
Willie.

251
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:07,414
They're on to me!

252
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:10,533
Come on, toss it down.

253
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,825
You feckin' little bastard.

254
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:18,865
I wring your bloody neck
when I get a hold of ya.

255
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:20,185
I'll box your ears in when I get you,

256
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,185
do you hear me?

257
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,225
You little toe rag.

258
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:23,653
Get back here.

259
00:17:24,533 --> 00:17:25,425
Ha ha.

260
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:27,025
I'm very proud of you, lad.

261
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,585
Willie, I think it's time
we talk about my salary.

262
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,105
Oh, what about it?

263
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:32,865
Well, I think it's time I had one.

264
00:17:33,013 --> 00:17:33,945
Ha!

265
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:35,860
We'll take that
sentiment down to the pub.

266
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:37,185
Arthur Blake.

267
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,145
When will you be making an
honest woman out of me, then?

268
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:41,425
Ah, go on, you old brasser.

269
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:42,744
You come back with your earnings,

270
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:44,664
and I'll show you a brasser.

271
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:45,744
Willie.

272
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:48,252
I think it's time we
talk about my salary, now.

273
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:01,584
Oh, shut up.

274
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:02,692
It's not even a full moon.

275
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,144
You'll have the mick
brigade after yous now.

276
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,104
After who?

277
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:14,384
Nobody saw me, Ronnie.

278
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:16,103
It was all the young blackguard's doing.

279
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:17,663
Yeah well, there'd be no Burke

280
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,983
without the little Hare over here.

281
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:21,543
You two are getting a reputation.

282
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:23,223
You need to lie low for a while.

283
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:24,658
Oh, we had to do it.

284
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:28,103
That ornament Dr. Quint had us
between a rock and a hard place.

285
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:30,063
And now we can't get near
the cemeteries no more.

286
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:32,463
He's threatening the law if
we don't keep up deliveries.

287
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,063
He's got you by the bollocks, then.

288
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:35,103
Bastard.

289
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:37,783
I'll drink to the end of him.

290
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:43,983
You know, I hear he plays
each corpse a tune on his fiddle

291
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:46,171
before he gets stuck in.

292
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,462
Enough of Quint.

293
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,570
Sever all ties, that's what I say.

294
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,250
Speak of the devil.

295
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,050
Evening, doctor.

296
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,050
Gentlemen.

297
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,089
A port, Ronnie, and
two ales for my friends.

298
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:28,701
It's very kind of you, boss.

299
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,861
That's what friends are for, Willie.

300
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:33,701
Wonderful catch last night, boys.

301
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:36,061
But I must admit I am curious

302
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:39,181
as to why it was such a
fresh and clean specimen.

303
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,741
Ah, well, nothing too untoward boss,

304
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,181
snatched it from a wake, so we did.

305
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:48,301
One must be creative in these times.

306
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,061
Advancing medicine is
what you two are doing.

307
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,501
History will be very kind, gentlemen.

308
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,901
As will I.

309
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:57,580
But I am afraid this
is not a social visit.

310
00:19:57,728 --> 00:20:00,020
My practice is in dire need, gentlemen.

311
00:20:00,168 --> 00:20:01,140
Ah.

312
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:02,540
Well, the thing is,

313
00:20:02,688 --> 00:20:04,340
things have been a
bit slow lately, boss.

314
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:06,700
What kind of weak fool are you?

315
00:20:06,848 --> 00:20:09,568
There's a perfect specimen
standing right beside you.

316
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:12,740
He helps me out.

317
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:14,248
He's earned his keep in this world.

318
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:17,620
I need more corpses,
and I need them now.

319
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:19,420
I don't care where they come from,

320
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,340
and if you two can't get them for me,

321
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,020
I'll hire Murphy and his men,

322
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:26,020
and I'll have two fresh
corpses on my table

323
00:20:26,168 --> 00:20:27,808
by the end of the week.

324
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:31,859
Swine.

325
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:35,299
He'll be the death of us.

326
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:37,687
Stiffed us with the bill too.

327
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:45,779
I have filth on you two,

328
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:47,939
enough to see you hanged,
drawn, and quartered.

329
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:48,939
I need them fresher.

330
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:50,579
Get rid of this stale thing

331
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:52,179
and bring me something worthwhile.

332
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:55,534
I need more corpses, more corpses.

333
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:57,179
I need more corpses.

334
00:20:57,327 --> 00:21:00,019
The stink of that
corpse is almost as foul

335
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,139
as the two of you.

336
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:04,018
Get me fresh specimens immediately,

337
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,686
or there will be trouble.

338
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:10,298
That's how it was for years.

339
00:21:10,446 --> 00:21:14,298
Slaving away for Quint,
making sure he was happy.

340
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,458
Meanwhile, we weren't making a penny.

341
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:17,898
On the bread line, we were.

342
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:20,778
A hard slog.

343
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:25,098
One job though, one
job changed all that.

344
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:28,886
One job turned us from
body snatchers into ghouls.

345
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:30,738
Ghouls?

346
00:21:30,886 --> 00:21:32,058
Ghouls.

347
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:33,498
A body snatcher will steal the dead,

348
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:36,497
but a ghoul will steal just
about anything, dead or other.

349
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:39,005
Time was when a corpse didn't do much,

350
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:40,657
just laid there.

351
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:41,925
Not so anymore.

352
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:46,297
Well, I mean, surely to God,

353
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:48,652
a corpse is a corpse is a corpse.

354
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,052
What harm is one to anyone?

355
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,097
Plenty, if it has a good mind to.

356
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,257
I see.

357
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:57,125
No, you don't.

358
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:58,857
I think I do.

359
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:02,617
Father, if I've learned
anything over the years,

360
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:08,085
it's that you never,
ever trust a corpse.

361
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:12,404
I had hoped to be
hearing these tales today.

362
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:17,496
When I first heard that the
snatchers Grimes and Blake

363
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:20,776
had been reprimanded, I
rushed here to meet with you.

364
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:21,816
You've heard of us, then?

365
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:23,896
Oh, your reputation precedes you

366
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:24,936
in certain circles.

367
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:27,376
Occult circles.

368
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:28,844
You have some knowledge
of the occult, then.

369
00:22:30,204 --> 00:22:31,164
Things that go...

370
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,696
In the night, yes.

371
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:34,976
Yes.

372
00:22:35,124 --> 00:22:36,736
When I first heard the stories,

373
00:22:36,884 --> 00:22:39,016
I thought they were
the stuff of nonsense.

374
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:41,456
But lately I've come to accept them,

375
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:44,415
and I actively pursue the tellers.

376
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,015
Unfortunately, my time
with them is brief.

377
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:49,123
In fact, you'd be dead right
now if it wasn't for me.

378
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:50,895
Is that so?

379
00:22:51,043 --> 00:22:51,975
Oh, yeah.

380
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:53,895
I paid the executioner
for our time together.

381
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:57,015
Is this the first
time you've paid someone

382
00:22:57,163 --> 00:22:59,643
to be alone with a man, Father?

383
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:07,883
You're not looking too
funny right now Mr. Blake.

384
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:17,894
Willie Grimes.

385
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:19,369
Willie Grimes introduced you

386
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:22,642
to the underbelly of
the resurrection trade.

387
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:26,974
Well, not so much as introduced me,

388
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:30,162
more as stumbled upon it with me.

389
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:44,094
Ronnie put us onto this job.

390
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:46,614
Out on the moors, it was,

391
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:48,402
right in the middle of nowhere.

392
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:52,493
Took us ages to find it.

393
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,401
But it was worth the effort.

394
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:03,881
Right, it's ready.

395
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,653
You can unearth the thing.

396
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:10,493
I'm wrecked.

397
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:13,053
You're getting old.

398
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,573
I'm getting hungry.

399
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:15,813
Me too.

400
00:24:15,961 --> 00:24:17,013
I hate this.

401
00:24:17,161 --> 00:24:19,053
Backbreaking work, and all
we ever are is famished.

402
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:20,733
And broke.

403
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:22,772
If that rotten bastard Quint
was a little less miserable,

404
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,772
things might be different.

405
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,292
We should do him in.

406
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,092
Ah, he's too well connected.

407
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,052
Besides, that's a mug's game.

408
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,812
Still, I'm hungry enough,

409
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,560
I could eat that corpse over there.

410
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,880
What you got there?

411
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,292
Sandwich.

412
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,332
A what which?

413
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,652
Sandwich.

414
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,892
It's food.

415
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,212
Food.

416
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,052
Two lumps of bread with
something in the middle.

417
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,092
It's genius.

418
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,047
Ah, it's queer.

419
00:24:51,195 --> 00:24:52,252
No, it's all right.

420
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,492
You can put anything inside.

421
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,412
What's in it?

422
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,051
Uh, looks like...

423
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,319
Like?

424
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:03,639
Looks like it tastes
better than it looks.

425
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,091
How did you afford one?

426
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:07,731
- I nicked it.
- Arthur.

427
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:08,771
What?

428
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:10,171
I'll pay them back when I'm flush.

429
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,171
I fancy a bite.

430
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,491
Give it here.

431
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:13,811
I'll tell you what.

432
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,691
I'll share it with you for
a few glugs of your whiskey.

433
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,839
Done.

434
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:38,370
Bloody hell.

435
00:25:38,518 --> 00:25:39,610
You were hungry.

436
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:41,198
You're not having any of mine.

437
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:50,370
What I don't get is
why they buried a corpse

438
00:25:50,518 --> 00:25:51,478
outside of a graveyard.

439
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:54,490
Suicide most likely.

440
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,770
Idiot clergy probably
excommunicated them,

441
00:25:56,918 --> 00:25:58,210
so there was nowhere else to bury them.

442
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:02,130
Why at a crossroads?

443
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:03,929
Gob shite superstition.

444
00:26:04,077 --> 00:26:05,729
So's if the spirit rises,

445
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:07,009
it'll not know which way is which

446
00:26:07,157 --> 00:26:08,729
and wander about the place lost.

447
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:09,889
Which way is which.

448
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:11,364
Which sandwich is which.

449
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:13,169
Boy, get at it, come on.

450
00:26:13,317 --> 00:26:15,277
All right, you moody so and so.

451
00:26:26,437 --> 00:26:28,129
Willie?

452
00:26:28,277 --> 00:26:29,809
What?

453
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:32,569
Look at this.

454
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,357
What, we don't know her, do we?

455
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:40,796
Oh, that's odd.

456
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:43,048
Look at its eyes.

457
00:26:43,196 --> 00:26:44,848
Maybe we should just leave it.

458
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:45,848
No.

459
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:47,488
Have that bastard Quint on our tails?

460
00:26:47,636 --> 00:26:50,688
It's a perfectly good piece.

461
00:26:50,836 --> 00:26:53,328
What's that around her neck?

462
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:55,648
That's... that's garlic.

463
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:58,608
Ronnie's got that stuff
all over the Fortune of War.

464
00:26:58,756 --> 00:27:00,328
Keep things away from the place.

465
00:27:00,476 --> 00:27:02,156
Garlic?

466
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:08,048
It's stinky.

467
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:09,047
Don't do that.

468
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,247
That's there for a reason.

469
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,355
Gob shite superstition, Willie.

470
00:27:14,555 --> 00:27:16,327
Who would do a thing like that?

471
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:17,887
I don't know, but I'm glad they did.

472
00:27:18,035 --> 00:27:20,195
This piece will put us in
good standing with Quint.

473
00:27:23,155 --> 00:27:24,487
Pull it out.

474
00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:25,567
No way, mate.

475
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:27,567
I dare you.

476
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:29,795
No way, I say.

477
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:35,567
You're out of your head.

478
00:27:35,715 --> 00:27:37,047
Help me.

479
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:39,435
Come on, help me.

480
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:51,886
Come on.

481
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:53,994
Let's get the corpse in the cart.

482
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:03,126
Oh, look at this mess.

483
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:05,966
What we need is a new cart, Arthur.

484
00:28:06,114 --> 00:28:08,474
Something roomy.

485
00:28:11,514 --> 00:28:13,354
How are we even gonna
fit the corpse in there?

486
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:21,193
Willie.

487
00:28:25,513 --> 00:28:27,433
Let's get the hell out of here.

488
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:29,845
Maybe she wasn't dead.

489
00:28:29,993 --> 00:28:31,365
Not exactly alive neither.

490
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:32,365
Un...

491
00:28:32,513 --> 00:28:33,473
Dead.

492
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,805
Bollocks, shite.

493
00:28:37,953 --> 00:28:38,845
What do you like, Grimes?

494
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:40,525
What do you like?

495
00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:42,953
Hey, do you hear that?

496
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:45,753
No, I do not.

497
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:56,844
Willie.

498
00:28:56,992 --> 00:28:58,844
Arthur.

499
00:28:58,992 --> 00:28:59,952
Willie.

500
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:12,952
Missus?

501
00:29:16,112 --> 00:29:17,672
You all right?

502
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,682
I think it's gone.

503
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,962
Why did you have to hit me?

504
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,922
It was all on you.

505
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,162
What else was I suppose to do?

506
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,202
Ow.

507
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,282
Look.

508
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,362
Ah, you're bleeding.

509
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,362
You keep away from me.

510
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,482
You might be inflicted.

511
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,550
Oh, shut up.

512
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,882
What time is it, huh?

513
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,922
How should I know?

514
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,402
I think it's getting lighter.

515
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,482
Yeah.

516
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,482
I think it might be gone.

517
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,722
Can we go then?

518
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,910
Yeah, I think so.

519
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:36,429
Willie!

520
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:50,921
That was mad.

521
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:52,401
Get back, get back.

522
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:54,361
What?

523
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:55,949
Get back, Arthur.

524
00:30:58,229 --> 00:30:59,161
What are you doing?

525
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:00,829
- Watch this.
- What are you doing?

526
00:31:04,268 --> 00:31:06,320
Oy, you mad bastard,
come on let's go.

527
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:07,388
Leave it.

528
00:31:10,988 --> 00:31:12,760
Don't do that.

529
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:14,840
Don't, you mad bastard,
don't do that, don't.

530
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:15,920
Come on, let's go, Willie.

531
00:31:16,068 --> 00:31:16,988
Let's go; I wanna go.

532
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,508
I've got an idea.

533
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:39,106
Thank you for your
sacrifice, my child.

534
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:02,037
After that job, we were
never bothered by Quint again,

535
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:04,397
and we struck gold with the undead.

536
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:06,837
We realized that people
would pay ten times as much

537
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,397
for your more unusual corpse.

538
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:11,157
And the jobs kept finding us.

539
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:13,197
It was as if we opened
the door to another world

540
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:14,277
and got a sniff of it,

541
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:16,996
or it got a sniff of us.

542
00:33:17,144 --> 00:33:19,384
Came across a whole many
of things after that.

543
00:33:21,864 --> 00:33:27,156
So trafficking the undead
was more lucrative, eh?

544
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:28,436
Absolutely.

545
00:33:28,584 --> 00:33:30,156
That's where the real money was.

546
00:33:30,304 --> 00:33:32,796
That's how it was for a while
for me and old Willie Grimes,

547
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:37,916
making good money snatching all
sorts of things dead, undead.

548
00:33:38,064 --> 00:33:41,116
And, uh, who paid you?

549
00:33:41,264 --> 00:33:42,556
A select few.

550
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:44,756
Those who realize the potential.

551
00:33:44,904 --> 00:33:46,596
Of course, it didn't
always go according to plan.

552
00:33:46,744 --> 00:33:48,995
There were times when we'd go to
the trouble of unearthing things

553
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:50,995
only to have them stolen from us.

554
00:33:51,143 --> 00:33:53,395
Snatched by a rival gang.

555
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:54,835
Sometimes at knifepoint.

556
00:33:54,983 --> 00:33:57,075
Rival gangs.

557
00:33:57,223 --> 00:33:59,555
Right bunch of
conniving swines they were.

558
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:00,835
You see, Willie and I,

559
00:34:00,983 --> 00:34:03,715
we were more your kind
of happy-go-lucky types.

560
00:34:03,863 --> 00:34:05,195
But, you know, some people took things

561
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,675
a little bit more seriously.

562
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:08,595
Some of them were real creeps.

563
00:34:08,743 --> 00:34:10,955
Such as?

564
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:13,395
We had run-ins with a crowd of lunatics

565
00:34:13,543 --> 00:34:15,183
called the House of Murphy.

566
00:34:17,783 --> 00:34:20,663
Ah, the famed House of Murphy.

567
00:34:22,822 --> 00:34:27,314
I've heard many stories about
Cornelius Murphy and his gang.

568
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:29,194
Hated us they did.

569
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:31,874
You see, we'd like to get in
and out the yards unnoticed.

570
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:34,794
But they would make this
big song and dance out of it.

571
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:39,554
He made us look like a
right bunch of amateurs.

572
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:43,154
You have any recent encounters
with the House of Murphy?

573
00:34:43,302 --> 00:34:46,834
Yeah, unfortunately, yes.

574
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:49,074
But let me tell you about this one time.

575
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:51,634
Strangest job I ever pulled.

576
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:54,062
It was most bloody peculiar.

577
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:58,953
You know, if you were to
drop down dead right now,

578
00:34:59,101 --> 00:35:02,193
I would sling you in that
cart and call it a night.

579
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:05,913
You wouldn't get a penny
for my whisky-logged corpse.

580
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:09,193
Hey, if I croak before you
do, feel free to make a penny.

581
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:10,313
I won't hear of it.

582
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:12,113
It's not proper.

583
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:14,633
Would you really try to sell me off?

584
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,553
I might.

585
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:19,153
The bloody cheek.

586
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:20,793
Do you like my new cart?

587
00:35:20,941 --> 00:35:22,873
It's quality.

588
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:23,953
Very modern.

589
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:26,353
Thought I might do a bit
of shite shoveling with it.

590
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,713
You know, running after the horses,

591
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:30,672
collecting their shite
to sell for compost.

592
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,432
Well, it's good money, and it's legal.

593
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,672
Hugo Fortune got me onto it.

594
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,592
Mind you, I haven't bothered yet.

595
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,552
Are you interested?

596
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,032
I could loan you out the cart.

597
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,752
No chance.

598
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,872
So what did Ronnie say
about this piece, then?

599
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,512
He said there's a corpse out here

600
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,272
that not only won't jump
up and try to kill us,

601
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,592
it'll fetch us a small fortune as well.

602
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,100
That's a bit curious, isn't it?

603
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,832
Bollocks.

604
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,872
Oh, fuck you, Grimes.

605
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,060
"Quality," what a piece of shite.

606
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:05,379
Get the shovels.

607
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:14,511
It's frozen.

608
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:15,911
What?

609
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:17,831
The ground.

610
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:20,099
It's frozen.

611
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:25,819
That's gonna take
all night to dig out.

612
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:27,631
Why is it frozen?

613
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:28,699
Nowhere else is.

614
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:35,271
Well, if whatever it is
that's down there is frozen,

615
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:36,870
then I'm a happy man.

616
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:37,990
'Cause if it's frozen,

617
00:36:38,138 --> 00:36:39,430
it won't be jumping about the place

618
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:40,470
trying to murder us.

619
00:36:40,618 --> 00:36:42,790
I suppose.

620
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:44,190
It's a bit unusual.

621
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:47,950
Ah, yes, Arthur, it's curious.

622
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:49,470
All right, I'll start it.

623
00:36:49,618 --> 00:36:51,778
You can finish it.

624
00:37:01,498 --> 00:37:03,618
Bugger.

625
00:37:15,457 --> 00:37:17,457
Ah.

626
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:54,656
Looks like a child's coffin.

627
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:58,348
Do they want the box and all?

628
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:02,148
Yeah, they said not
to even try to open it.

629
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:04,308
I'm not carrying that thing back.

630
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:05,748
It's freezing.

631
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:08,468
Well, we should smash it open.

632
00:38:08,616 --> 00:38:11,308
Oh, fetch more if we don't.

633
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,388
Ow.

634
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,188
Oh, that hurt.

635
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:17,615
Hey, give us your knife.

636
00:38:21,015 --> 00:38:23,947
If I can wedge this in.

637
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:25,627
I'm telling you, be careful.

638
00:38:25,775 --> 00:38:31,375
Ow, ow, my fingers, freezing over.

639
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:34,947
Let's just kick it back.

640
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:40,347
No, no, no, let's
wrap it and carry it.

641
00:38:40,495 --> 00:38:41,467
Wrap it with what?

642
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:42,627
Ah, it's heavy.

643
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,107
That's no child in there.

644
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,695
It's heavy.

645
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:03,386
Look at that.

646
00:39:03,534 --> 00:39:06,666
What do you reckon that is?

647
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:07,826
Don't know.

648
00:39:07,974 --> 00:39:09,334
Never seen anything like it.

649
00:39:12,294 --> 00:39:14,214
It's not moving, is it?

650
00:39:15,694 --> 00:39:18,746
No.

651
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:21,066
Could be from Dotsie's,

652
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:22,825
you know, the circus?

653
00:39:22,973 --> 00:39:24,893
Could be a little freak from Dotsie's.

654
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,465
I don't think so.

655
00:39:26,613 --> 00:39:28,693
I don't think that thing is
from anywhere near Dotsie's.

656
00:39:29,693 --> 00:39:31,613
Look at the size of its head.

657
00:39:36,253 --> 00:39:39,773
Well, be easier to move now.

658
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:47,733
It's not as cold as it was in the box.

659
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,545
All right. All right.

660
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:51,945
Let's get out of here.

661
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:53,493
Come on.

662
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:57,572
Good evening to you, gentlemen.

663
00:39:57,852 --> 00:39:59,224
Now, if you don't mind terribly,

664
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:01,584
you'll be dropping that
corpse off for me now.

665
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:05,372
Willie, do you know this asshole?

666
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:09,064
Cornelius, don't mind the young fellow.

667
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:11,464
He's a little fresh around the ears.

668
00:40:11,612 --> 00:40:13,419
Hand that there over now, boy.

669
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:16,744
Arthur meet Cornelius Murphy.

670
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:20,024
Now, be a pet and hand
him over the whatsit.

671
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:21,704
Having a laugh, aren't you?

672
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,572
I'd listen to your boss if
you want to live past tonight.

673
00:40:27,372 --> 00:40:28,224
That's a good lad.

674
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:31,183
Now pass it along.

675
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:34,463
Don't be stupid, Arthur.

676
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:35,783
Do as the gentleman says.

677
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:37,531
I'll explain later.

678
00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:46,543
On the ground there.

679
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:49,663
Do it.

680
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:51,183
Afraid I can't do that.

681
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:52,863
You see, this took us
a few hours to dig up.

682
00:40:53,011 --> 00:40:55,531
Now that we've got it, I
don't want to give it back.

683
00:40:58,291 --> 00:40:59,543
Drop it and live.

684
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,651
Drop the corpse.

685
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:28,862
What?

686
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,182
Oh, my head.

687
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,542
I admire your pluck, lad.

688
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,181
When you're through fumblin'
about cemeteries with this fool,

689
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,409
come and call on the House of Murphy.

690
00:41:42,489 --> 00:41:44,421
Somebody snatched our snatchins.

691
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,569
I think I'm in the
wrong line of business.

692
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:50,461
I'm all light-headed.

693
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:51,861
How did they manage it?

694
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,221
Hey, who did you say that was again?

695
00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:58,981
That was Cornelius Murphy,
and you're lucky to be alive.

696
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:01,101
I think he just offered me a job.

697
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:03,581
What and leave a
good thing like this?

698
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,981
No.

699
00:42:06,129 --> 00:42:09,500
He seemed a little
bit too intense to me.

700
00:42:09,648 --> 00:42:12,700
So Fortune of War?

701
00:42:12,848 --> 00:42:14,980
Oh, aye.

702
00:42:15,128 --> 00:42:16,300
I'm flat broke though.

703
00:42:16,448 --> 00:42:18,140
Yeah, me too.

704
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:19,540
I got this new bird, though.

705
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:20,860
She might have a couple of quid.

706
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:24,688
Ah, good for you, son.

707
00:42:26,888 --> 00:42:28,260
Some jobs were harder than others.

708
00:42:28,408 --> 00:42:30,620
We went hungry at times,

709
00:42:30,768 --> 00:42:33,820
but mainly we made off
with whatever we snatched.

710
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,860
But you, uh...

711
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:37,260
you took him up on his offer, Murphy.

712
00:42:37,408 --> 00:42:38,380
No.

713
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:39,620
But I considered it.

714
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:41,060
There were no flies on him,

715
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:44,139
and if there were,
they were paying rent.

716
00:42:44,287 --> 00:42:46,659
But you crossed paths again?

717
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:47,739
Oh, aye.

718
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:49,259
Well, Willie and I had
it in for the snobs.

719
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:50,739
They thought they were better than us.

720
00:42:50,887 --> 00:42:54,419
When was... when was the
last time you crossed paths?

721
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:55,779
Not too long ago, but here.

722
00:42:55,927 --> 00:42:57,699
Let me tell you about the time
I teamed up with The Whistler.

723
00:42:57,847 --> 00:42:59,139
Hoo.

724
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:00,219
Uh, Mr. Blake.

725
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:01,579
He was a slippery bollocks.

726
00:43:01,727 --> 00:43:03,419
What about The Wrinkler?

727
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:04,459
I have a million stories.

728
00:43:04,607 --> 00:43:07,767
I knew all the snatchers.
- Mr. Blake!

729
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:10,419
If we had the time,

730
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,579
I'd love to hear all
your lovely stories,

731
00:43:12,727 --> 00:43:16,418
but time is of the essence.

732
00:43:16,566 --> 00:43:18,698
Now I would like to hear
about the House of Murphy.

733
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,738
Why?

734
00:43:19,886 --> 00:43:20,818
They're a gang of assholes.

735
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:22,298
I'm bored talking about them.

736
00:43:22,446 --> 00:43:23,618
Got what they deserved.

737
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,573
What did they get?

738
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:27,338
Eh?

739
00:43:27,486 --> 00:43:30,738
Look.

740
00:43:30,886 --> 00:43:34,606
I would love to finish my
chapter on the House of Murphy.

741
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:38,726
Now, tell me about Cornelius.

742
00:43:41,806 --> 00:43:43,138
Fair enough.

743
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:45,378
Let me see.

744
00:43:45,526 --> 00:43:49,817
Mad bastard from a long
line of mad bastards,

745
00:43:49,965 --> 00:43:52,377
not much of a sense of humor,

746
00:43:52,525 --> 00:43:54,977
believed to be in league with Lucifer.

747
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,737
Was he now?

748
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,137
And what about his gang?

749
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:01,057
Well, old Cornelius and his gang

750
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,617
had a knack for snatching the undead.

751
00:44:03,765 --> 00:44:05,097
They took it very personally.

752
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:07,097
It's a family business with them.

753
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,417
His father was the real mastermind,

754
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:12,417
had Cornelius and his gang
doing all his dirty work,

755
00:44:12,565 --> 00:44:14,125
supposed to be a right evil bastard.

756
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:17,697
Anyway, Willie and I were
told to stay clear of them,

757
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:19,097
and we did mainly.

758
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:20,137
That's how it was for years.

759
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:21,377
We kept our head above water.

760
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,976
Ronnie helped us out by
keeping his ear to the ground.

761
00:44:24,124 --> 00:44:26,924
We even took on an
apprentice, Fanny Bryers.

762
00:44:30,564 --> 00:44:32,004
One point, she was a wrecker.

763
00:44:34,444 --> 00:44:35,576
A wrecker?

764
00:44:35,724 --> 00:44:38,496
Oh, she would lure
ships onto the rocks

765
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:39,724
and scavenge the wreckage.

766
00:44:45,284 --> 00:44:46,296
But she got bored of that

767
00:44:46,444 --> 00:44:49,376
and had aspirations of being a snatcher.

768
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:52,216
Fanny Bryers, hmm.

769
00:44:52,364 --> 00:44:55,695
Lovely, lovely Fanny Bryers.

770
00:44:55,843 --> 00:44:56,775
Lovely.

771
00:44:56,923 --> 00:44:58,095
Did you here that, Willie?

772
00:44:58,243 --> 00:44:59,175
Arthur says I'm lovely.

773
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:02,643
Well, he must be drunk,
you boozy old slapper.

774
00:45:03,603 --> 00:45:05,215
Oh, shove off, you.

775
00:45:05,363 --> 00:45:06,335
I am lovely.

776
00:45:06,483 --> 00:45:07,615
You are lovely.

777
00:45:07,763 --> 00:45:08,655
You are.

778
00:45:08,803 --> 00:45:10,495
Don't you even listen to him.

779
00:45:10,643 --> 00:45:11,815
Oh!

780
00:45:11,963 --> 00:45:15,095
You should be ashamed of your selves.

781
00:45:15,243 --> 00:45:17,055
Here it is.

782
00:45:17,203 --> 00:45:18,055
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

783
00:45:18,203 --> 00:45:20,295
That's mine.

784
00:45:20,443 --> 00:45:21,375
Ready? Ready?

785
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:22,535
Are you ready, Mr. Grimes?

786
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:23,615
Right, wait a minute.

787
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,855
When I finish this pint,

788
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:27,735
I'm gonna put the
empty glass on me head,

789
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:29,214
and that's when you two go for it.

790
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:31,054
Right, then?

791
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:32,362
Okay, here we go.

792
00:45:38,922 --> 00:45:40,602
It's very sexy.

793
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:22,973
It's a bleedin' draw.

794
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:24,013
Robbed I was.

795
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:25,013
I was robbed.

796
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:26,053
Ha!

797
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:28,093
I'm catching up with you, old man.

798
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:29,093
I was robbed of that.

799
00:46:29,241 --> 00:46:31,453
Come here.

800
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:32,893
You'll have him
the next time, Arthur.

801
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:33,973
Yeah, I will.

802
00:46:34,121 --> 00:46:37,172
I'll have you next time.

803
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,692
Can you two talk business?

804
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,332
Sober as a judge, mate.

805
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,092
You remember Maisey O'Connell?

806
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,812
I'll box your ears in when I get you.

807
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,052
Do you hear me?

808
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,212
A friend of the family.

809
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,452
Is she still not talking to you?

810
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,532
No.

811
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,692
Neither is me family.

812
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,852
She's in here the other night.

813
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,452
She's got a new job
working at the old mortuary,

814
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,892
you know, the place that handles

815
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,852
a lot of the old walking stiff trade.

816
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,212
It's her first night on the job,

817
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,359
and no one had told her about
their more unusual shipments.

818
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,731
What did she come across?

819
00:47:11,879 --> 00:47:13,811
Well, she wouldn't say,

820
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:18,251
so I filled the aul wan so
full of booze she couldn't walk.

821
00:47:18,399 --> 00:47:20,091
I called her a carriage.

822
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:22,931
I closed the place down.

823
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,691
There's no love nor money

824
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:28,131
could drag me back to
that place ever again.

825
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:29,331
Yes, dear.

826
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,131
Get in.

827
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:34,651
And me with me nerves.

828
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:38,011
So terrified she
was with what she saw,

829
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:40,091
she insists I ride with her.

830
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:41,691
You had a bad day, Maisey?

831
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:42,690
What was that?

832
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:46,210
A... a bad day, Maisey.

833
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:47,530
Ah.

834
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:51,090
Lantern Jesus, for a moment there

835
00:47:51,238 --> 00:47:54,810
I thought I dreamt up the whole thing.

836
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:58,930
Oh, I never want to go
back to that place again.

837
00:47:59,078 --> 00:48:02,170
You sure you might not
feel different in the morning?

838
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,330
It's off to the house
of the Lord in the morning.

839
00:48:06,478 --> 00:48:11,250
'Twas pure and simple
evil I met up with.

840
00:48:11,398 --> 00:48:14,090
Was it something hideous and awful?

841
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:15,369
You can talk to me, Maisey.

842
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,849
I'm a good listener.

843
00:48:17,997 --> 00:48:21,649
What did you see today?

844
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:24,649
The living dead.

845
00:48:24,797 --> 00:48:26,369
Bingo.

846
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:27,369
Lovely.

847
00:48:27,517 --> 00:48:29,769
Yeah, the woman was mortified,

848
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:31,889
said she was expecting
a shipment that morning.

849
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:34,449
Shipment was to arrive by
boat, but the boat crashed,

850
00:48:34,597 --> 00:48:36,849
somewhere off of Langols Island.

851
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,809
Only one of three boxes was recovered.

852
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,917
What was in the box?

853
00:48:43,037 --> 00:48:45,569
Took me ages to prize open the box.

854
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:47,929
And I'm only an old woman,

855
00:48:48,077 --> 00:48:50,208
and there was nobody else about.

856
00:48:50,356 --> 00:48:51,968
Ah, but you got it open.

857
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:55,756
Oh, I opened it, all right.

858
00:49:14,636 --> 00:49:16,356
Brilliant.

859
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:22,047
That's very funny, Ronnie.

860
00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:25,087
Yous two are terrible.

861
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:27,327
The poor woman.

862
00:49:27,475 --> 00:49:29,127
So how'd she get away, Ron?

863
00:49:29,275 --> 00:49:32,287
Oh, it had the grip on me.

864
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:35,955
'Twas the unholy grasp of Satan.

865
00:49:37,395 --> 00:49:40,527
I looked into its dead, black eyes,

866
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:45,075
and I could see meself
screaming back at meself.

867
00:49:46,235 --> 00:49:50,607
Oh, I thought I was dead for sure.

868
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:55,526
Jesus, Maisey, you're
lucky to be alive.

869
00:49:55,674 --> 00:49:58,126
It was horrible,

870
00:49:58,274 --> 00:50:01,594
the pale, spidery thing.

871
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:09,406
If it hadn't been
for my cross and chain,

872
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:12,886
he would have had me guts for garters.

873
00:50:13,034 --> 00:50:16,646
A cross, eh?

874
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:20,046
A good thing in all
the rest never arrived.

875
00:50:20,194 --> 00:50:22,966
Expecting two more we were,

876
00:50:23,114 --> 00:50:26,926
but word has it they got lost at sea.

877
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:31,885
And now they tell me they got
washed up on Langols Island

878
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:35,125
and have to be retrieved.

879
00:50:35,273 --> 00:50:38,673
Well, I want nothing more to do with it.

880
00:50:39,353 --> 00:50:42,125
It seems a few "surgeons"
believe these things

881
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:44,085
may be the key to immortality.

882
00:50:44,233 --> 00:50:45,245
That's why they're so desperate

883
00:50:45,393 --> 00:50:47,445
to get their hands on these corpses.

884
00:50:47,593 --> 00:50:48,525
Immortality?

885
00:50:48,673 --> 00:50:50,405
Well, who's off to
Langols Island, then?

886
00:50:50,553 --> 00:50:52,085
Who's with old Willie?

887
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:53,365
Easy pickings.

888
00:50:53,513 --> 00:50:55,285
Nice little earner, boys.

889
00:50:55,433 --> 00:50:56,925
We'll need a what you may call it,

890
00:50:57,073 --> 00:50:58,285
a crustafix.

891
00:50:58,433 --> 00:50:59,445
A crucifix, love.

892
00:50:59,593 --> 00:51:02,359
Yeah, well, there's just
one problem, boys and girls.

893
00:51:02,507 --> 00:51:04,564
Ah, no worries, Ronnie.

894
00:51:04,712 --> 00:51:05,724
Name your percentage.

895
00:51:05,872 --> 00:51:07,364
Yeah, well, it is
a tiny little slice,

896
00:51:07,512 --> 00:51:09,484
but that's not the problem.

897
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:13,044
They've, uh, hired somebody to
help them pick up the pieces.

898
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:14,284
Who?

899
00:51:14,432 --> 00:51:17,004
It seems the mortuary has
called on the House of Murphy

900
00:51:17,152 --> 00:51:18,752
to help them out.

901
00:51:24,232 --> 00:51:25,764
That's that, then.

902
00:51:25,912 --> 00:51:28,044
Bollocks.

903
00:51:28,192 --> 00:51:29,204
What's the House of Murphy?

904
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:30,284
Not what, who.

905
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:33,044
It's a vicious gang of body snatchers

906
00:51:33,192 --> 00:51:34,444
that I don't want to cross.

907
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,083
We'd be fools to try, Willie.

908
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:39,563
Now, they can't be all that bad.

909
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:42,163
Let me tell you something
about the House of Murphy.

910
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:44,643
First of all, there's
the big wig himself,

911
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:47,963
Samuel Murphy, Sam the Spider.

912
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:50,043
Keeps himself well out of sight.

913
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,123
They call him the Spider

914
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:53,043
because he likes to play
with his victims for hours

915
00:51:53,191 --> 00:51:54,043
before killing them.

916
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:55,403
They say once he's ready to kill,

917
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:58,683
he uses a three-clawed
hook to gauge out the eyes

918
00:51:58,831 --> 00:52:00,843
and the tongues of his victims.

919
00:52:00,991 --> 00:52:03,723
Then there's his son, Cornelius Murphy.

920
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:07,923
One of the meanest bastards
I've ever met, alive or dead.

921
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:10,202
Rumor has it he's a corpse grinder,

922
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,282
grinds the bones from
the coffins he's nicked

923
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,282
and sniffs them.

924
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:18,922
He can smell out the dead
before they're even cold.

925
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:22,522
Valentine Kelly,
Murphy's right-hand man,

926
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:26,762
so to speak.

927
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:27,882
They say she got her name

928
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,242
after she was almost burned to death

929
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,557
by a lover on Valentine's Day.

930
00:52:32,705 --> 00:52:34,562
Her face is so twisted and deformed

931
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:38,590
that she keeps it hidden except
for those she's about to kill.

932
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,401
Then there's the Bulger.

933
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:44,921
You couldn't find a more loyal servant.

934
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:47,681
Murphy saved him from
being beaten to death once.

935
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:49,361
Left with no teeth,

936
00:52:49,509 --> 00:52:53,761
Murphy had a dentist of sorts
graft dog teeth onto his gums.

937
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,509
Bulger owes him everything.

938
00:52:57,189 --> 00:52:59,041
You're all cowards.

939
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:01,281
There's money to be
made in Langols Island.

940
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:03,721
That's enough to keep
us all happy and lovely

941
00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:05,361
for a really long time.

942
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:07,681
You lot are telling me you're afraid.

943
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:08,721
In a word, yes.

944
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:09,801
Yes.

945
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:10,921
Yeah, looks like it.

946
00:53:11,069 --> 00:53:13,361
This lot can't be any worse
than what's in those boxes.

947
00:53:13,509 --> 00:53:14,669
Fanny, forget it.

948
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:20,040
I'm sticking to the cemeteries.

949
00:53:20,188 --> 00:53:21,160
Lads.

950
00:53:21,308 --> 00:53:25,920
Remember, you are our apprentice,

951
00:53:26,068 --> 00:53:27,800
not our partner.

952
00:53:27,948 --> 00:53:29,668
You got to reign it in a little, love.

953
00:53:30,748 --> 00:53:32,800
Thanks, Ronnie, but no thanks.

954
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:35,200
Yeah, well, maybe it's for the best.

955
00:53:35,348 --> 00:53:38,000
Just thought I'd give
you lads a heads-up.

956
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,080
Murphy and his lot,

957
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:42,268
they won't be on the island
till tomorrow morning.

958
00:54:19,587 --> 00:54:21,519
There'll be other jobs, Fanny.

959
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:23,198
When?

960
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:24,918
There won't be other jobs like this one.

961
00:54:25,066 --> 00:54:26,518
If we're afraid of
crossin' a few knackers

962
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:27,598
like this Murphy's lot.

963
00:54:27,746 --> 00:54:30,598
This one could've set us up for a while,

964
00:54:30,746 --> 00:54:33,598
gave us enough money to enjoy life,

965
00:54:33,746 --> 00:54:36,558
take me down to the Sinister
Duck once in a while,

966
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:37,638
live it up,

967
00:54:37,786 --> 00:54:41,198
instead of going to that old
kip every night of the week.

968
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:44,238
What about our dream of
doing better for ourselves?

969
00:54:44,386 --> 00:54:45,318
You be careful of dreams, Fanny.

970
00:54:45,466 --> 00:54:47,078
They'll lead you down a garden path

971
00:54:47,226 --> 00:54:48,118
and into a ditch before you know it.

972
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:50,078
The Fortune of War,

973
00:54:50,226 --> 00:54:51,638
filled with people who
followed their dreams.

974
00:54:51,786 --> 00:54:52,998
Look what they got to.

975
00:54:53,146 --> 00:54:54,838
Willie's right,

976
00:54:54,986 --> 00:54:56,712
keep chipping away at the smaller jobs,

977
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,797
everything else will fall into place.

978
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:00,552
Willie Grimes.

979
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,877
What about him?

980
00:55:02,025 --> 00:55:03,917
If you had any backbone,
you'd be out on your own

981
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:05,997
instead of letting that
old drunk lean on you.

982
00:55:06,145 --> 00:55:08,037
He's a drunken old coward,
and he's dragging you down.

983
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:09,077
That's not fair.

984
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:10,117
Willie and I go back a long way.

985
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,517
You'd be on that island if you
weren't listening to his fears.

986
00:55:13,665 --> 00:55:16,237
We could be on and
off before anyone else.

987
00:55:16,385 --> 00:55:18,077
There'd be no trouble.

988
00:55:18,225 --> 00:55:19,117
It'll end badly,

989
00:55:19,265 --> 00:55:20,397
and it'll end with a lot of blood.

990
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:21,997
You don't know what
these people are like.

991
00:55:22,145 --> 00:55:23,557
This is your first job.

992
00:55:23,705 --> 00:55:25,437
Took me years to get it down.

993
00:55:25,585 --> 00:55:27,197
Willie's right.

994
00:55:27,345 --> 00:55:28,516
You have to earn your keep

995
00:55:28,664 --> 00:55:30,464
before you tackle a big job like this.

996
00:55:31,944 --> 00:55:33,636
If we're gonna make it
anywhere in this world,

997
00:55:33,784 --> 00:55:35,556
we got to stand up for ourselves.

998
00:55:35,704 --> 00:55:37,716
This Cornelius and his
dad can't be all that bad.

999
00:55:37,864 --> 00:55:40,144
No one's that mean.

1000
00:55:43,264 --> 00:55:45,196
When Cornelius was five,

1001
00:55:45,344 --> 00:55:49,584
his mother gave him one
of them clockwork toys.

1002
00:55:59,344 --> 00:56:00,716
He loved it.

1003
00:56:00,864 --> 00:56:03,303
He was always playing with
it, always winding it up.

1004
00:56:05,183 --> 00:56:07,115
His father stomped on it.

1005
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,183
He just crushed it.

1006
00:56:12,423 --> 00:56:14,035
Then there was the time
when little Cornelius

1007
00:56:14,183 --> 00:56:15,995
found a baby chick.

1008
00:56:16,143 --> 00:56:18,115
Called it Pappy, fed it,

1009
00:56:18,263 --> 00:56:22,343
you know, took a shine to it.

1010
00:56:28,223 --> 00:56:30,903
His dad crushed the life out of it.

1011
00:56:32,383 --> 00:56:34,115
Poor little Pappy,

1012
00:56:34,263 --> 00:56:36,622
all spread out on the floor like that.

1013
00:56:38,582 --> 00:56:41,594
Then his mother buys him a rabbit.

1014
00:56:41,742 --> 00:56:43,269
This time Cornelius is determined

1015
00:56:43,417 --> 00:56:45,834
not to let his old man harm the animal.

1016
00:56:45,982 --> 00:56:49,754
At age five, he strangles
it and partially devours it,

1017
00:56:49,902 --> 00:56:51,862
just so his old man can't get to it.

1018
00:56:55,142 --> 00:56:57,314
He's a born and bred merciless killer

1019
00:56:57,462 --> 00:56:59,114
trained not to care about life or death.

1020
00:56:59,262 --> 00:57:01,474
It's a different league.

1021
00:57:01,622 --> 00:57:03,034
Feck this.

1022
00:57:03,182 --> 00:57:04,394
I'm off to Langols Island.

1023
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:05,994
I can take care of meself.

1024
00:57:06,142 --> 00:57:10,353
And if you and that poxy
Willie Grimes are too scared,

1025
00:57:10,501 --> 00:57:11,873
then I'll see you down at the pub later.

1026
00:57:12,021 --> 00:57:14,021
You can't go on your own.

1027
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:21,353
Well, then get up out
of bed and come with me.

1028
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:22,793
We need this job, Arthur.

1029
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:24,033
I'm sick of being broke.

1030
00:57:24,181 --> 00:57:25,953
There's good money
coming to us, Fanny.

1031
00:57:26,101 --> 00:57:27,913
There'll be no trouble.

1032
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:29,793
Please, Arthur.

1033
00:57:29,941 --> 00:57:31,073
We can do this.

1034
00:57:31,221 --> 00:57:32,193
What are you doing?

1035
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:34,948
I'll make it worth your while.

1036
00:57:35,096 --> 00:57:37,513
It'll end badly.

1037
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:38,553
Fanny?

1038
00:57:38,701 --> 00:57:41,273
Arthur.

1039
00:57:41,421 --> 00:57:43,032
Fanny.

1040
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,152
Forget it.

1041
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,632
There's no way I'm going to the island,

1042
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,780
and that's the last word of it.

1043
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,672
Must be out of our bleeding minds,

1044
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,232
out here at this hour of the night.

1045
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,580
Letting a woman tell you what to do.

1046
00:58:18,259 --> 00:58:19,751
Yeah, well, you'll
be thanking me tonight

1047
00:58:19,899 --> 00:58:20,991
when we've made a
killing off of this lot.

1048
00:58:21,139 --> 00:58:22,871
A killing.

1049
00:58:23,019 --> 00:58:24,351
That's what I'm afraid of.

1050
00:58:24,499 --> 00:58:26,311
Oh, shut up, Willie.

1051
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:27,351
We're out here now.

1052
00:58:27,499 --> 00:58:30,311
We may as well make the most of it.

1053
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:31,471
I can't see a thing in this fog.

1054
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:32,911
How far is the island?

1055
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:37,351
Ought to be there by morning
if we don't hit rocks or worse.

1056
00:58:37,499 --> 00:58:39,431
Worse?

1057
00:58:39,579 --> 00:58:41,186
There are things
swimming around in this sea

1058
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:43,111
that you don't want to come across.

1059
00:58:43,259 --> 00:58:45,511
Have you been out here before?

1060
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:46,871
No.

1061
00:58:47,019 --> 00:58:49,298
Only ever heard the stories.

1062
00:58:50,178 --> 00:58:53,110
Me da used to go fishing out here.

1063
00:58:53,258 --> 00:58:54,150
Yeah, my little brother and I

1064
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:55,750
used to watch him from the summit.

1065
00:58:55,898 --> 00:58:58,218
That's a really nice memory, Arthur.

1066
00:59:00,498 --> 00:59:03,390
There was this one time

1067
00:59:03,538 --> 00:59:06,145
he was coming back in to land.

1068
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:09,510
The water all around
him started bubbling up,

1069
00:59:09,658 --> 00:59:11,150
and then we saw it.

1070
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:18,150
A black mist it was,
surrounding my old man's boat.

1071
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:24,217
Something hidden inside sucked
him down to a watery grave.

1072
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:30,177
Yes, that's a... that's
a lovely memory, Arthur.

1073
00:59:32,537 --> 00:59:34,669
Ah, he was all right, he was.

1074
00:59:34,817 --> 00:59:36,189
Never laid a hand on us neither.

1075
00:59:36,337 --> 00:59:37,377
A hard worker too.

1076
00:59:39,217 --> 00:59:41,937
Bloody fool to be
fishing in these waters.

1077
00:59:42,817 --> 00:59:44,309
True.

1078
00:59:44,457 --> 00:59:47,149
So we have a few hours on
Murphy and his men, right?

1079
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:49,749
Ronnie said they wouldn't
be here by morning.

1080
00:59:49,897 --> 00:59:52,909
Get the crates, get
the hell out of there.

1081
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:53,989
No trouble, right, Willie?

1082
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:57,308
That's fine by me.

1083
00:59:57,456 --> 00:59:58,816
Did you bring your crucifix?

1084
01:00:04,536 --> 01:00:08,703
Of course.

1085
01:00:08,851 --> 01:00:09,776
Whoopsie daisey.

1086
01:00:20,856 --> 01:00:22,468
Did you hear that?

1087
01:00:22,616 --> 01:00:23,988
Aye.

1088
01:00:24,136 --> 01:00:26,788
What was it?

1089
01:00:26,936 --> 01:00:31,815
Arthur's old fella coming
back to give him a clatter.

1090
01:00:33,055 --> 01:00:36,987
There's worse things out here
than running into my old dad.

1091
01:00:37,135 --> 01:00:38,895
I hate these waters.

1092
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,147
It's eerie.

1093
01:00:43,295 --> 01:00:46,907
I suggest we keep our
mouths closed from here on in.

1094
01:00:47,055 --> 01:00:50,347
Wake me up when we get there.

1095
01:00:50,495 --> 01:00:52,935
Must be out of our bleeding minds.

1096
01:02:06,173 --> 01:02:07,105
Excuse me.

1097
01:02:07,253 --> 01:02:09,664
Could you keep the noise down, please?

1098
01:02:09,812 --> 01:02:12,732
Or I'll cut your bleeding head off.

1099
01:02:27,892 --> 01:02:29,584
What are we gonna do now?

1100
01:02:29,732 --> 01:02:31,224
No killing, you said, no trouble.

1101
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,664
We was gonna knock him out with this.

1102
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:35,064
And have him get up and kill us?

1103
01:02:35,212 --> 01:02:36,379
You must be daft.

1104
01:02:36,527 --> 01:02:37,864
You have no idea
what you've just done.

1105
01:02:38,012 --> 01:02:39,579
They've cornered the
market for too long.

1106
01:02:39,727 --> 01:02:40,624
This is our time.

1107
01:02:40,772 --> 01:02:41,664
We're going to be rich.

1108
01:02:41,812 --> 01:02:43,263
You stupid cow.

1109
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:45,651
Willie, just get the
crates side by side.

1110
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:49,051
Just do it now.

1111
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:50,863
Listen, you,

1112
01:02:51,011 --> 01:02:52,263
I've done foolish things in my life,

1113
01:02:52,411 --> 01:02:54,903
but I have never put anyone
in harm's way to make a profit.

1114
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:57,103
And what you've done here...

1115
01:02:57,251 --> 01:02:58,143
You.

1116
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:00,331
We go now, with her or without her.

1117
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,023
We may as well get
what we came here for.

1118
01:03:03,171 --> 01:03:04,903
Arthur, have you lost your balls?

1119
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:06,783
No, but look, it's right here.

1120
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:09,178
Listen, if we go now,
we can still go unnoticed.

1121
01:03:09,326 --> 01:03:10,743
Yeah, and empty-handed.

1122
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:13,423
You don't get it at all, do you?

1123
01:03:13,571 --> 01:03:15,142
If we stay here, we're as good as dead.

1124
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:18,302
He wasn't so hard, was he?

1125
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:20,062
Come on.

1126
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:21,610
We don't have all day.

1127
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,662
Not everyone is the boss of me.

1128
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:26,862
Hey, come on.

1129
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,262
Let's just get it over with.

1130
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,862
Willie.

1131
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:31,610
Willie!

1132
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,422
What now?

1133
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:45,530
Get the yokes out of the
crate and into the cage.

1134
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:50,581
I suppose they're just gonna line up

1135
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:52,421
and waltz in there of their own accord.

1136
01:03:52,569 --> 01:03:54,861
Hey, look at this.

1137
01:03:55,009 --> 01:03:56,261
What are we supposed to do with that?

1138
01:03:56,409 --> 01:03:58,501
Put it in their mouths.

1139
01:03:58,649 --> 01:04:01,421
Stop 'em from biting us.

1140
01:04:01,569 --> 01:04:02,581
Look, we'll open up the crates.

1141
01:04:02,729 --> 01:04:04,541
When they jump out, we'll
shove this in their mouth.

1142
01:04:04,689 --> 01:04:05,581
Put 'em in the cage.

1143
01:04:05,729 --> 01:04:07,896
We'll fill up the cage,
anchor the cage to the boat,

1144
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,129
drag 'em back to the mainland.

1145
01:04:10,049 --> 01:04:11,089
Won't they drown?

1146
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:15,661
Come on, boys.

1147
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:17,489
There's nothing to worry about.

1148
01:04:21,729 --> 01:04:22,980
You got it?

1149
01:04:23,128 --> 01:04:24,928
Ready? Careful.

1150
01:04:26,368 --> 01:04:27,328
All right.

1151
01:04:32,248 --> 01:04:34,220
What's happening?

1152
01:04:34,368 --> 01:04:36,660
It's horrible.

1153
01:04:36,808 --> 01:04:37,700
Arthur?

1154
01:04:37,848 --> 01:04:40,180
There's a foot in here.

1155
01:04:40,328 --> 01:04:42,260
Very bloody odd.

1156
01:04:42,408 --> 01:04:45,220
A foot.

1157
01:04:45,368 --> 01:04:47,980
That's not gonna
fetch much at market,

1158
01:04:48,128 --> 01:04:49,260
is it Willie?

1159
01:04:49,408 --> 01:04:51,260
A foot?

1160
01:04:51,408 --> 01:04:52,380
Bloody hell.

1161
01:04:52,528 --> 01:04:54,008
Hmm.

1162
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:13,727
Hmph.

1163
01:05:28,606 --> 01:05:30,526
Get it off me!

1164
01:05:31,646 --> 01:05:32,498
Darling.

1165
01:05:32,646 --> 01:05:35,538
I got it!

1166
01:05:35,686 --> 01:05:36,806
Get him off me!

1167
01:05:42,926 --> 01:05:44,966
Get him still!

1168
01:06:04,805 --> 01:06:05,737
You okay?

1169
01:06:05,885 --> 01:06:07,525
What's it bloody well look like?

1170
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,377
What the bleeding
hell are you laughing at?

1171
01:06:10,525 --> 01:06:11,417
That thing nearly killed me.

1172
01:06:11,565 --> 01:06:13,017
It called you darling,
did you hear that?

1173
01:06:13,165 --> 01:06:15,252
I think you've got a
new friend there, Willie.

1174
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,817
What if I got infected?

1175
01:06:16,965 --> 01:06:18,297
What if I'm... what if I'm infected?

1176
01:06:18,445 --> 01:06:19,857
What if I turn into one of those things?

1177
01:06:20,005 --> 01:06:20,857
Come on, calm down.

1178
01:06:21,005 --> 01:06:22,017
It's just... let's have a look.

1179
01:06:22,165 --> 01:06:23,805
Looky there.

1180
01:06:24,845 --> 01:06:26,177
Oh, go on, laugh it up.

1181
01:06:26,325 --> 01:06:28,805
Well, you know, it's pretty...

1182
01:06:37,924 --> 01:06:43,056
One, two, three, four, and five.

1183
01:06:43,204 --> 01:06:46,444
I reckon that's five
dead I'm selling tonight.

1184
01:06:49,564 --> 01:06:51,536
Go on, get out of it.

1185
01:06:51,684 --> 01:06:53,456
I blame all of this on you, Arthur.

1186
01:06:53,604 --> 01:06:54,496
Me?

1187
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:55,536
No one dragged you here.

1188
01:06:55,684 --> 01:06:57,736
You and that Fanny have ruined me.

1189
01:06:57,884 --> 01:06:59,496
That bite has me all peculiar.

1190
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:02,496
Don't bring poor old Fanny into it.

1191
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:03,604
What are we gonna do now?

1192
01:07:04,924 --> 01:07:06,324
I have a backup plan.

1193
01:07:09,203 --> 01:07:11,415
No.

1194
01:07:11,563 --> 01:07:13,615
Ha.

1195
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,250
Bugger this.

1196
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:17,010
Excuse me, Mr. Murphy.

1197
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:21,655
Perhaps we can come to
some sort of arrangement?

1198
01:07:21,803 --> 01:07:25,455
I like the arrangement
we have now, Arthur Blake.

1199
01:07:25,603 --> 01:07:28,175
You tied to that cage,

1200
01:07:28,323 --> 01:07:31,295
as I strap it to me boat
and drag you along the seabed

1201
01:07:31,443 --> 01:07:33,615
for the journey home.

1202
01:07:33,763 --> 01:07:35,455
I just thought you
might need an extra man

1203
01:07:35,603 --> 01:07:37,775
now that you're down Mr. Bulger and all.

1204
01:07:37,923 --> 01:07:40,375
I'd rather sell your wet corpse.

1205
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:42,414
Arthur, you weasel.

1206
01:07:42,562 --> 01:07:44,482
Just go along with me.

1207
01:07:47,882 --> 01:07:49,654
A rat leaving a sinking ship, is it?

1208
01:07:49,802 --> 01:07:51,294
That's the one.

1209
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,009
Very honorable.

1210
01:07:53,157 --> 01:07:56,934
Now, where was the honor in
trying to rob me of me loot

1211
01:07:57,082 --> 01:07:59,134
and going and killing
my good mate Bulger?

1212
01:07:59,282 --> 01:08:05,134
Oh, well, it wasn't really the
intention, you see, Cornelius.

1213
01:08:05,282 --> 01:08:06,882
We was just trying to
make a few quid is all.

1214
01:08:08,722 --> 01:08:17,681
Tell me, Mr. Blake,
do you like your trade?

1215
01:08:19,321 --> 01:08:20,853
I suppose so.

1216
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:22,608
It's a bit messy, isn't it?

1217
01:08:22,756 --> 01:08:23,733
Well, let me tell you.

1218
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:28,761
I love this trade, Mr. Blake.

1219
01:08:30,121 --> 01:08:33,813
And I come from a very
long line of ghouls.

1220
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:40,281
So you see, I take a great
deal of pride in what I do.

1221
01:08:41,761 --> 01:08:46,608
So when a sleveen like
yourself comes along

1222
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:49,532
and thinks he can cross me,

1223
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,132
well, then,

1224
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:56,680
that's when I get angry, Mr. Blake.

1225
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,532
And Grimes...

1226
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,852
you should have known better.

1227
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,852
Whoa, now, Cornelius,
don't be like that.

1228
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,040
I was just along for the salt air.

1229
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,892
Valentine.

1230
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,760
Why don't you show 'em your face.

1231
01:09:45,239 --> 01:09:47,319
Oh, Willie!

1232
01:09:55,318 --> 01:09:56,278
Willie! Willie!

1233
01:10:27,998 --> 01:10:29,437
Let's go, let's go.

1234
01:11:00,837 --> 01:11:03,088
Are you two gonna kiss and make up?

1235
01:11:03,236 --> 01:11:04,608
'Cause I don't want a ruckus in here,

1236
01:11:04,756 --> 01:11:07,996
not before midnight.

1237
01:11:13,076 --> 01:11:14,076
What're you looking at?

1238
01:11:15,796 --> 01:11:18,476
You was gonna turn
your back on old Willie.

1239
01:11:20,396 --> 01:11:21,888
No, I was just saying that.

1240
01:11:22,036 --> 01:11:22,928
I had a plan.

1241
01:11:23,076 --> 01:11:24,843
A plan.

1242
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:27,083
You was all set to
join the House of Murphy

1243
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:28,528
and forget about me.

1244
01:11:28,676 --> 01:11:30,283
Me, who taught you everything.

1245
01:11:30,431 --> 01:11:31,723
Well, I had to say something.

1246
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:32,916
What do you want from me?

1247
01:11:34,076 --> 01:11:36,007
Very, very disappointed
in you, Arthur.

1248
01:11:36,155 --> 01:11:37,087
Oh, you're disappointed?

1249
01:11:37,235 --> 01:11:38,247
- Yeah.
- Well, likewise.

1250
01:11:38,395 --> 01:11:39,687
And what about poor old Fanny?

1251
01:11:39,835 --> 01:11:40,835
Hmph, Fanny.

1252
01:11:41,915 --> 01:11:42,847
That daft cow.

1253
01:11:42,995 --> 01:11:43,927
She got what she deserved.

1254
01:11:44,075 --> 01:11:45,447
Is that all you can say?

1255
01:11:45,595 --> 01:11:47,127
Well, it was all her idea.

1256
01:11:47,275 --> 01:11:48,167
Or was it?

1257
01:11:48,315 --> 01:11:50,442
You know, she always
said you were a coward.

1258
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:52,487
She said I should go it alone.

1259
01:11:52,635 --> 01:11:54,047
Well, you are going it alone, mate.

1260
01:11:54,195 --> 01:11:56,007
Enough is enough.

1261
01:11:56,155 --> 01:11:57,235
Fine.

1262
01:11:58,395 --> 01:11:59,767
Great, good riddance.

1263
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:00,807
Fine, then.

1264
01:12:00,955 --> 01:12:02,487
You know, I'll probably do a
lot better on my own, I think.

1265
01:12:02,635 --> 01:12:03,527
- Fine.
- Get out!

1266
01:12:03,675 --> 01:12:04,607
- Fine.
- Get out.

1267
01:12:04,755 --> 01:12:05,647
Fine.

1268
01:12:05,795 --> 01:12:06,727
Good night, sir.

1269
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:08,914
Get the fuck out of my bar.

1270
01:12:15,034 --> 01:12:16,846
And that's how me and Willie left it,

1271
01:12:16,994 --> 01:12:19,886
arguing like a pair of old women.

1272
01:12:20,034 --> 01:12:23,081
What a way to end one
of the great friendships.

1273
01:12:23,229 --> 01:12:26,194
A week went by, here I am.

1274
01:12:29,354 --> 01:12:31,966
But you killed Cornelius Murphy?

1275
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,726
Not my style, Father.

1276
01:12:35,874 --> 01:12:38,366
Well, then it was Grimes
that struck him down.

1277
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:40,726
It was Fanny that did the killing.

1278
01:12:40,874 --> 01:12:43,033
We just left Cornelius
and Valentine to it.

1279
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:48,925
So you just left him to die?

1280
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:50,525
Oh, aye.

1281
01:12:50,673 --> 01:12:56,045
Now here I am, an innocent
man waiting for the guillotine.

1282
01:12:56,193 --> 01:12:59,193
Oh, none of us is
innocent, Mr. Blake.

1283
01:13:02,273 --> 01:13:04,765
And I've listened to
your tales, and you're...

1284
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:07,325
you're far from innocent.

1285
01:13:07,473 --> 01:13:10,005
In fact, I think the
guillotine is too good for you.

1286
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:15,192
Grimes was lucky to have avoided me.

1287
01:13:19,712 --> 01:13:23,564
Well...

1288
01:13:23,712 --> 01:13:26,472
it's very nice to make your
acquaintance, Mr. Murphy.

1289
01:13:34,712 --> 01:13:36,724
You must be a little
disappointed in your son.

1290
01:13:36,872 --> 01:13:38,484
All that training,

1291
01:13:38,632 --> 01:13:40,164
and he gets struck down by two commoners

1292
01:13:40,312 --> 01:13:43,724
like Grimes and myself.

1293
01:13:43,872 --> 01:13:45,992
You're not common, Mr. Blake.

1294
01:13:48,032 --> 01:13:49,071
In fact, you're quite rare.

1295
01:13:53,351 --> 01:13:54,723
It's not every day you meet someone

1296
01:13:54,871 --> 01:13:57,798
who's about to spend the
rest of their days in agony.

1297
01:13:57,946 --> 01:13:58,843
You best hurry up so.

1298
01:13:58,991 --> 01:14:01,763
I'll be under the
blade in a few minutes.

1299
01:14:01,911 --> 01:14:03,203
No.

1300
01:14:03,351 --> 01:14:06,003
You won't be seeing the guillotine.

1301
01:14:06,151 --> 01:14:07,631
You're not as lucky as your friend.

1302
01:14:09,351 --> 01:14:11,151
I've made other arrangements for you.

1303
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:17,043
You little bastard.

1304
01:14:17,191 --> 01:14:18,883
You do not disrespect
the House of Murphy.

1305
01:14:19,031 --> 01:14:19,923
Do you hear me?

1306
01:14:20,071 --> 01:14:21,990
You little bastard!

1307
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,922
This is how it ends, Arthur Blake.

1308
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:26,962
You pup.

1309
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:28,002
You little pup.

1310
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:29,602
This is how it ends for you.

1311
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,350
I'll open you!

1312
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,562
Do it, then.

1313
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:35,642
Do it!

1314
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:37,122
Your son was an awful prick.

1315
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:38,162
A prick.

1316
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,522
You little bastard.

1317
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:40,630
You little bastard!

1318
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:43,430
Oy!

1319
01:14:55,749 --> 01:14:57,269
- Willie.
- Arthur.

1320
01:14:58,149 --> 01:15:00,081
You're undead.

1321
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:03,601
That bite on the island
has me all supernatural.

1322
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,161
It took me ages to find me head.

1323
01:15:05,309 --> 01:15:06,789
It's a... it's a bit disconcerting.

1324
01:15:08,389 --> 01:15:10,789
Well, I thought he had me there.

1325
01:15:14,829 --> 01:15:19,081
Oh, he cut you up something horrible.

1326
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:23,321
Well, it's great to see you.

1327
01:15:23,469 --> 01:15:24,841
I thought you were
sick of the sight of me.

1328
01:15:24,989 --> 01:15:27,469
Ah, no bother.

1329
01:15:29,348 --> 01:15:30,508
You look like shite, Willie.

1330
01:15:31,508 --> 01:15:35,360
Oh.

1331
01:15:35,508 --> 01:15:36,835
Well, it's a good thing I went first,

1332
01:15:36,983 --> 01:15:40,520
or else you'd be a dead man.

1333
01:15:40,668 --> 01:15:42,200
There you go.

1334
01:15:42,348 --> 01:15:43,680
Ah, here we are.

1335
01:15:43,828 --> 01:15:45,508
Oh, that's one I owe you.

1336
01:15:46,908 --> 01:15:49,360
Fancy him, coming after us.

1337
01:15:49,508 --> 01:15:50,760
Yeah, I know.

1338
01:15:50,908 --> 01:15:52,035
Said he was a priest.

1339
01:15:52,183 --> 01:15:53,280
Had me going there for a while.

1340
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:54,240
Mad bastard.

1341
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:57,748
Well, he'd fetch us
a few quid, you reckon?

1342
01:15:58,548 --> 01:15:59,960
Let's get out of here.

1343
01:16:00,108 --> 01:16:01,068
Ooh.

1344
01:16:02,707 --> 01:16:04,479
Hey, that's mad, you being undead.

1345
01:16:04,627 --> 01:16:06,479
Oh, uh, are you any good at sewing?

1346
01:16:06,627 --> 01:16:07,519
Ha.

1347
01:16:07,667 --> 01:16:08,959
So you're like a cat, then?

1348
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:10,079
Nine lives.

1349
01:16:10,227 --> 01:16:12,319
Oh, I figure it
will keep on happening.

1350
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:13,879
But here's what we should do.

1351
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:16,079
We should go down to Langols Island

1352
01:16:16,227 --> 01:16:17,319
and find one of them yokes

1353
01:16:17,467 --> 01:16:19,554
and have it take a
little nibble out of you.

1354
01:16:19,702 --> 01:16:20,599
No, thanks.

1355
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:22,359
Oh, it's the best thing
that ever happened...

1356
01:16:22,507 --> 01:16:23,719
Whoa.

1357
01:16:23,867 --> 01:16:24,994
You okay?

1358
01:16:25,142 --> 01:16:27,199
I tell you what, I'll think about it.

1359
01:16:27,347 --> 01:16:29,959
Hey, you're not gonna get all
cannibalistic on me, are you?

1360
01:16:30,107 --> 01:16:32,119
Ah, no.

1361
01:16:32,267 --> 01:16:33,999
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1362
01:16:34,147 --> 01:16:36,478
Mind you...

1363
01:16:36,626 --> 01:16:38,358
I am feeling a bit peckish.

1364
01:16:38,506 --> 01:16:39,713
I'll take you down to The Fortune,

1365
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:40,758
get you some supper.

1366
01:16:40,906 --> 01:16:43,638
Oh, it's a different
kind of hunger, Arthur.

1367
01:16:43,786 --> 01:16:45,758
Oh, aye?

1368
01:16:45,906 --> 01:16:48,078
I'm ravenous, Arthur.

1369
01:16:48,226 --> 01:16:49,118
Me?

1370
01:16:49,266 --> 01:16:50,198
Give us a nibble.

1371
01:16:50,346 --> 01:16:51,553
No, no, get away from me.

1372
01:16:51,701 --> 01:16:53,626
Don't come near me.
