2
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,811
Welcome.

3
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:36,189
Dr Atherton, I presume.

4
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:39,278
- Wait a minute, not so fast.
- We're in a hurry, Mr Manley.

5
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:43,325
Leave your personal things. Just bring
your equipment. We depart immediately.

6
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:46,243
Miguel Higueras, our field assistant.

7
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:49,627
Sorry I'm late. I've been held up in
Caracas for a while with a fever.

8
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:51,462
Tell the truth, I'm not over it yet.

9
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,546
Be sick on your own time, Mr Manley.

10
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:56,545
I want close-ups of every specimen

11
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:59,594
<i>and coverage of the surrounding
rain forests and tepuis.</i>

12
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:00,637
The what?

13
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:03,387
<i>Tepui. It's an Indian
word for mountain.</i>

14
00:02:03,518 --> 00:02:07,218
A place where species have survived
in isolation for millions of years.

15
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:09,098
Any man-eating dinosaurs?

16
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:13,776
Atherton, you're in luck.
We're hitting a brand-new one today.

17
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:15,812
Great. Anybody ever get lost?

18
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:19,399
Legend says men who climb
to the rain desert never return,

19
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:23,662
but don't worry, we small-game hunters
don't climb, we fly!

20
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:50,469
He friendly?

21
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:53,522
I hope so. He's our guide.

22
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,560
Stick close.

23
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:26,258
Twenty-four hour ant.

24
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:28,007
They bite?

25
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:31,760
They kill, Mr Manley,
in sufficient numbers.

26
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,312
So do some of the frogs.

27
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:35,721
Don't touch any.

28
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,527
Great.

29
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:03,793
This is where we're going.
We land here, then walk down here.

30
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:05,209
This is a sinkhole.

31
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:08,181
A place where thousands of years
of streaming water

32
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,098
have torn away the rock.

33
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,206
It's very deep. 2,000 feet.

34
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:46,093
And dark at the bottom.
We'll need flash equipment.

35
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:09,276
<i>Stegolepis.</i>

36
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:12,444
Edible and nutritious enough
to survive on for weeks.

37
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,120
Thanks, I'll pass.

38
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,704
Plants your specialty?

39
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:18,832
Insects and spiders
and identifying new ones.

40
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,411
Great. Just what the world needs.
More bugs.

41
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:29,762
What's your speciality, Manley?

42
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:32,471
Football.

43
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,800
Let's forget the fact that
no one mentioned poison ants and frogs,

44
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,838
but a 2,000-foot drop? Come on!

45
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:17,214
This is for the equipment.

46
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,923
Our guide will show us another way down.

47
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,165
What's with him?

48
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:50,420
This is as far as he'll go.

49
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,420
What?

50
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:27,497
It's amazing.

51
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:30,913
The air temp's dropped 10 degrees
in the last 100 meters.

52
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:32,505
Not far.

53
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:34,007
Down there.

54
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:06,288
- You all right?
- Yeah.

55
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:08,324
I'm fine, I just...

56
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:14,084
What'd he say?

57
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:18,338
He says you should be careful.
You're too big for us to carry out.

58
00:08:55,712 --> 00:08:57,919
Wait up!

59
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:30,322
What does that thing do, anyway?

60
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:33,990
Did you ever throw a large firecracker
into a pond?

61
00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:35,750
Maybe when I was a kid. Why?

62
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:38,250
What happened?

63
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,706
All sorts of stuff floated to the surface.

64
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,299
Exactly.

65
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:44,086
Everybody ready?

66
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:19,168
Prepare yourselves, gentlemen.

67
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:22,375
For what?

68
00:10:40,317 --> 00:10:42,143
For pictures, Manley, pictures.

69
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:01,043
What is it?

70
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:04,086
I think it's a new species of butterfly.

71
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:07,131
<i>We could call it... photius manlii.</i>

72
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,225
Extraordinary.

73
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:24,397
Look at these markings.

74
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:27,644
Don't just sit there.

75
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:29,488
Are you sure it's dead?

76
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:31,736
Yes, quite dead.

77
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:43,206
Two more.

78
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,878
This is highly unusual.

79
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,792
So many spiders this size
in such a confined area.

80
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:50,000
Look at the shape of the abdomen.

81
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:52,542
We must try to find a live specimen.

82
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,519
- What do you think you're doing?
- It was alive.

83
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:06,393
Don't be ridiculous.

84
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,352
It's just a spider. What's the big deal?

85
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:10,477
It isn't just a spider.

86
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:12,523
It was potentially a new species of spider.

87
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:15,657
Isolated and unchanged
for millions of years.

88
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:17,610
And all you could do is squash it.

89
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,498
That's impossible. They should be dead.

90
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:30,207
Very aggressive.

91
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:32,961
We'll take two back alive and preserve two.

92
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,650
Are you sure that'll do it?

93
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:58,905
This stuff will kill an elephant.

94
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:01,860
Millions of years, then we come along.

95
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,538
How long's it gonna take us
to get back to camp?

96
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:11,706
What's the matter?
You still worried about dinosaurs?

97
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:14,875
This place just gives me the creeps.

98
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:26,429
Incredible.

99
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:27,594
What is?

100
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,850
These spiders have
no reproductive organs.

101
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:33,770
Almost like worker bees or soldier ants.

102
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:41,783
Yeah, well, if these are the soldiers,
I'd hate to see the general.

103
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:43,488
How are you feeling?

104
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,111
Like hell. This fever's killing me.

105
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:49,533
You don't look so good. Take a rest.

106
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:02,004
The fever.

107
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:09,421
Make sure we've got
all his film, Higueras.

108
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:11,049
Have we notified his family?

109
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:13,174
I contacted the American consulate.

110
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:16,100
Okay, seal him up.

111
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:59,784
I really wish you wouldn't
complain about my driving.

112
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:00,863
Ready?

113
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,155
You're pushing it. That's all I got to say.

114
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,999
Take it easy, wait.

115
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,050
Can you give me a hand here?

116
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,222
I think I'll go move the hearse.

117
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:49,914
Dick, I'm sorry to pester you
in this already difficult time.

118
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,378
I know that we already decided
on an open casket,

119
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,840
but we should maybe reconsider.

120
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:03,048
Because I'm not sure
how they work down in South America,

121
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:07,394
but let me say that their
preservation methods differ from ours.

122
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,807
No, you'd be welcome
to come down and decide,

123
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:17,319
but in this already difficult time,
I'm not sure I could do that.

124
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:20,695
No, you do have the option of...

125
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,661
We could put a photograph
on top of the casket.

126
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:28,488
No, the one that you had
in the newspaper.

127
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:18,670
Okay, kids, go stake out your rooms!

128
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:27,094
Ross, smell that air!

129
00:20:33,313 --> 00:20:34,477
Let's just...

130
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,262
Before we discover what valuables
broke in the move,

131
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:39,440
and that the breakfront doesn't fit,

132
00:20:39,568 --> 00:20:43,188
let's just chant twice:

133
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:45,279
"We did the right thing."

134
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:50,027
- For the kids.
- For us. For all of us.

135
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:53,365
- Goodbye crime, goodbye grime.
- Right.

136
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,705
Goodbye culture, goodbye friends.

137
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:03,174
Dad, there's a dead bird over here!

138
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:06,385
Don't touch it.

139
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,920
Just go on into the house
and find your sister.

140
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:15,226
Ross, the entire town is yours.

141
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:18,557
You're the doctor.
Can there be a more respected figure?

142
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:22,903
Respect is fine, but actually
I've always wanted to be feared.

143
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:26,065
Easy with that.

144
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:28,737
You don't want to agitate the sediments.

145
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:32,155
Château Margaux. $127 a bottle.

146
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,828
Tasty, huh?

147
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:38,365
At that price, who can afford to drink it?

148
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:40,660
Goes in the basement.

149
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:45,041
I mean the cellar.

150
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:49,171
The wine cellar.

151
00:21:55,352 --> 00:21:58,684
I gotta get a big padlock.
Protect my investment.

152
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:00,605
Dad!

153
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:04,275
- What's wrong?
- Behind one of the boxes, a spider.

154
00:22:05,238 --> 00:22:06,944
It came at me, it was ugly.

155
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:09,230
- Bigger than this.
- Okay, calm down.

156
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:11,773
You're in the country now, okay?

157
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:14,199
Come on, let's go find that spider.

158
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:17,413
And let's find your mom
to take care of that spider.

159
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,325
Honey, we're in the living room.
We need you to kill a spider.

160
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:23,452
All right. Where is it?

161
00:22:23,588 --> 00:22:25,131
Over there, on the box.

162
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:26,798
Killing a spider, cool!

163
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:29,380
It's bad luck to kill a
spider in a new house.

164
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:31,384
You just made that up, didn't you, dear?

165
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:35,009
Okay. Everything's okay.

166
00:22:40,063 --> 00:22:41,520
Poor thing.

167
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:44,055
It's more scared of us than we are of it.

168
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:46,598
Let's give it a home in the barn.

169
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:48,112
Good idea, Shell.

170
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:08,630
Mom, how come you're not
afraid of bugs like Dad is?

171
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:11,674
I'm not afraid of all bugs. Just...

172
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:14,339
- Be careful of rusty nails.
- Chill out.

173
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,630
How about right here?

174
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:30,192
You sure you won't miss
being in the thick of things?

175
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:35,570
With all those stars and those crickets
singing, we are in the thick of things.

176
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,536
I mean work. Strokes from the boss.

177
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:43,656
Christmas bonuses, office politics,
caffeine, adrenaline,

178
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,785
steady income...

179
00:23:46,752 --> 00:23:48,376
We'll be fine.

180
00:23:48,503 --> 00:23:53,332
Between my severance and all your
potential patients, we'll be fine.

181
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:56,919
When are you meeting with Dr Metcalf?

182
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:58,217
Thursday morning.

183
00:23:58,347 --> 00:24:01,468
The old coot passes me the torch
at 10.00 sharp.

184
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:07,266
Wait.

185
00:24:07,898 --> 00:24:10,188
We can unpack in the morning.

186
00:24:10,902 --> 00:24:13,570
I have some Napoleon brandy
in the basement.

187
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:15,739
Sorry, cellar.

188
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:18,438
Ross, I'm exhausted.

189
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:22,240
It's bad luck not to make love
the first night in a new house.

190
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:24,991
You just made that up, didn't you, dear?

191
00:24:54,152 --> 00:24:59,359
I have terrific news. At least, I
think, for my patients it's terrific.

192
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,945
Though my wife is less than thrilled.

193
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:03,820
What's that, Dr Metcalf?

194
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:06,112
I've decided to postpone retirement.

195
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:09,122
I don't know for how long, but...

196
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:11,788
But?

197
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,253
But when I thought really hard about it,
I realised,

198
00:25:15,382 --> 00:25:18,465
there's only one thing left
to do when you retire,

199
00:25:18,593 --> 00:25:21,463
and I've seen too many friends
do that very thing

200
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:24,881
just six months, a year
after they gave up their professions.

201
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:26,509
But you...

202
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:32,557
When we spoke just four months ago,
you assured me that...

203
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,730
I'm not ready to retire, doctor.

204
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:39,069
And if my wife can't rush me into it,
you sure as hell can't either.

205
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:58,169
Excuse me.

206
00:25:58,298 --> 00:26:01,251
You gotta feed the meter, partner.

207
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:04,009
Yeah, well, I was just leaving.

208
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:06,130
A little late, though.

209
00:26:07,891 --> 00:26:09,765
I do have medical plates.

210
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:16,355
Oh, right. You're that new doctor.

211
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:19,152
- Ross Jennings.
- Sheriff Lloyd Parsons.

212
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,648
You're a Yale grad, I heard.

213
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:23,404
That's right.

214
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,108
Well, it's just a school, isn't it?

215
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:29,787
That's enough, Lloyd Parsons.

216
00:26:29,913 --> 00:26:33,280
A young doctor comes to Canaima
and you write him a parking ticket?

217
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:36,536
- What are you doing, Ms Hollins?
- What the whole town ought to do.

218
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,496
Your ticker tape parade.

219
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,623
- Thank you.
- That's littering.

220
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:42,665
Lloyd's been a bully since the 5th grade.

221
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,673
I ought to know, I held him back.

222
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:46,545
Walk me to my automobile.

223
00:26:50,892 --> 00:26:52,848
Thank you for the swift intervention.

224
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:55,432
- How did you know who I was?
- We're neighbours.

225
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:58,480
I gave you a standing ovation
when you arrived.

226
00:27:00,026 --> 00:27:04,153
Between you and me, Sam Metcalf
only recently gave up leeches.

227
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:07,067
He also recently gave up retirement.

228
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,523
We moved from San Francisco
with the understanding

229
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,491
that I would inherit all of his patients,
but now I have none.

230
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:17,073
No, Dr Jennings, you have one.

231
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:24,587
Honey, look at this light.

232
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:28,215
On the best day in the city,
we didn't get light like this.

233
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:30,136
Maybe they'll give me a show in town.

234
00:27:30,263 --> 00:27:33,134
Don't they do that in little towns?
In the town hall?

235
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:35,758
"Molly Jennings, a retrospective."

236
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:38,765
Of course, I'll need to
take some pictures first.

237
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:42,101
There's good news and there's bad news.

238
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:45,768
Should we go in reverse-alphabetical
order and start with the good?

239
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,567
I'm seeing my first patient this afternoon.

240
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,154
She's a great old dame,
she lives just up the road.

241
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:55,492
Terrific. What's the bad news?

242
00:27:55,622 --> 00:27:58,194
She's my only patient.

243
00:27:58,915 --> 00:28:00,031
Today?

244
00:28:05,631 --> 00:28:07,708
Metcalf changed his mind.

245
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:10,548
- What?
- Yeah.

246
00:28:10,678 --> 00:28:12,755
He panicked, is what it is.

247
00:28:12,888 --> 00:28:14,928
He decided that if he retires

248
00:28:15,057 --> 00:28:20,218
he will lose his zest for life
and die within 48 hours or something.

249
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:21,895
But he told you.

250
00:28:22,022 --> 00:28:24,263
We looked in 14 towns,
we bought a house,

251
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,273
you rented an office.

252
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:28,229
What are we going to do?

253
00:28:29,238 --> 00:28:31,065
Kill him?

254
00:28:32,741 --> 00:28:36,027
I have my fax machine.
I can work part-time from here.

255
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:40,325
A phone and a fax, that's all I need.
I'll call my old clients.

256
00:28:40,457 --> 00:28:43,209
- Even with half my commissions...
- We're gonna be fine.

257
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:45,375
- Just like you said.
- With one patient?

258
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:49,964
Maybe I'll get lucky and all of her systems
will be ravaged by disease.

259
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:52,463
Kind of like having seven patients in one.

260
00:28:58,392 --> 00:29:00,299
Fit as a fiddle.

261
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:02,554
Not a damn thing wrong with you.

262
00:29:02,688 --> 00:29:04,846
Dr Jennings, I'm sorry.

263
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,358
What do you mean? Do you think I was
hoping you were ravaged by disease?

264
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,773
What about my high blood pressure?

265
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:16,106
You have above-normal systolic pressure,

266
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:18,698
which is less dangerous
than a diastolic elevation.

267
00:29:18,827 --> 00:29:21,865
And yours is well below a level
that requires treatment.

268
00:29:22,957 --> 00:29:24,748
Do I need these?

269
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,501
No.

270
00:29:27,628 --> 00:29:31,541
See, there's a difference between
the two types of hypertension.

271
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:32,873
And in my opinion...

272
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:38,170
In my opinion, Dr Metcalf doesn't know
his ass from a hole in the ground.

273
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:40,878
But Canaima folks,
they're comfortable with him.

274
00:29:41,017 --> 00:29:43,138
They weren't always, though.

275
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:47,396
When he first hit town just after the war,
everyone was terribly standoffish.

276
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:51,105
- How'd he overcome that?
- He threw a party, invited the whole town.

277
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:55,019
If Sam Metcalf were half as good
at medicine

278
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:59,698
as he is at public relations,
he could run for the next surgeon general.

279
00:30:01,244 --> 00:30:04,494
That's it. Next month,
when the afternoons are cooler

280
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:06,780
we'll throw you a party.

281
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,917
Thanks.

282
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:40,673
So, your one patient,
is she a walking health hazard?

283
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,088
I couldn't even find a wart on her.

284
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:45,759
Great, so what do we do?

285
00:31:47,391 --> 00:31:50,307
Enjoy the fact that since we
no longer live in San Francisco,

286
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:52,393
we no longer have to
refer to this as pasta.

287
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,557
- Skinny spaghetti.
- Daddy's not done.

288
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,853
On the bright side,

289
00:31:56,982 --> 00:32:00,851
Margaret, my tragically healthy patient,

290
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:03,655
has offered to throw us
a "Get to know Dr Jennings" party.

291
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,730
Daddy's not done.

292
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:09,317
One cup of punch
with the handsome new GP

293
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:13,451
and the good people of Canaima will see
the light and abandon old Doc Metcalf.

294
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:16,119
- It's a nice gesture.
- Yeah.

295
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:17,663
Can we go play with Bunny?

296
00:32:17,796 --> 00:32:20,368
Yeah, I want you both in
before dark, though.

297
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,961
Bunny Beechwood.
She popped over this morning.

298
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:26,968
A neighbour. Seems nice.

299
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,634
What do you bet they're gonna
go chase fireflies or something?

300
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:34,930
- Wanna blow up a bullfrog?
- Okay!

301
00:32:36,564 --> 00:32:38,805
I got some great shots in the barn today.

302
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:43,566
If the camera picks up the web
with half the detail my eyes do...

303
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,355
The web?

304
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,240
Yeah, our little spider
made himself a hell of a home.

305
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,073
I think even you would appreciate it.

306
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:56,159
Molly... how can I make this more clear?

307
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,075
- I have...
- A terrible fear of spiders.

308
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,881
I'm aware, I've seen what happens.

309
00:33:03,006 --> 00:33:07,252
Which is why I think you should force
yourself to come and look at the web.

310
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,713
Look at the web?

311
00:33:08,845 --> 00:33:13,258
Yes, and see it for the extraordinary
and beautiful thing it is.

312
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:15,016
Therapy, Ross.

313
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:16,720
We live in the country now.

314
00:33:16,853 --> 00:33:20,684
It's time to work through
this irrational, paralysing terror.

315
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:23,106
- It's not irrational.
- I know.

316
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:25,144
The incident.

317
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:26,986
It's like it happened yesterday.

318
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:30,148
Nobody remembers anything
from when they were two.

319
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,867
It's my first memory.

320
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:36,788
I can envision the crib,

321
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,451
all around me, clear as day.

322
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,576
I can still feel the feeling of waking up.

323
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,126
Just drowsy, peaceful, secure,
then there it was.

324
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,625
- Probably just a daddy longlegs.
- It seemed huge.

325
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:53,884
It just came relentlessly,
crawling through the bars of the crib.

326
00:33:54,013 --> 00:33:57,299
- As it touched my bare leg...
- I know, you were just wearing a diaper.

327
00:33:57,434 --> 00:34:00,601
All my limbs involuntarily froze.

328
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:02,472
You were probably still half-asleep.

329
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:05,310
I was paralysed, Molly.
I still get paralysed.

330
00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:07,566
Try to understand how this makes me feel.

331
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:12,735
I was physically unable to stop it
from crawling along my naked skin.

332
00:34:14,076 --> 00:34:17,445
I can still feel its hairy
little legs just...

333
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:19,907
Then up to my face.

334
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,998
It's the feeling of utter helplessness.

335
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:26,744
Being explored by an alien thing,
that's all.

336
00:34:30,884 --> 00:34:34,050
Can you blame me
for being a spider-phobe?

337
00:34:34,971 --> 00:34:36,844
Arachnophobe.

338
00:34:36,972 --> 00:34:38,597
Whatever.

339
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:46,637
You see it up there,
right beyond the ladder.

340
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:57,284
Impressive, huh?

341
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:20,889
Therapy, right?

342
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:22,427
Right.

343
00:35:41,536 --> 00:35:43,030
Oh, God.

344
00:35:44,956 --> 00:35:48,490
There, you see?
You still have full use of all your limbs.

345
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:57,166
Have you seen it up here?

346
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:00,887
I think you spared the eight-legged
Frank Lloyd Wright.

347
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,440
Are you okay? Honey, it's okay!

348
00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:15,275
What the hell was that?

349
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:16,601
It's...

350
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:19,947
Come on.

351
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:30,822
Jesus!

352
00:36:31,793 --> 00:36:34,250
Hold me!

353
00:36:36,298 --> 00:36:38,125
Oh, my God!

354
00:36:53,983 --> 00:36:57,018
<i>@ From across the sea</i>

355
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:21,007
How are you finding life here?

356
00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:24,835
After a few initial shocks,
we're slowly adjusting, I think.

357
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:27,342
I've been checking on you, Ross.

358
00:37:27,472 --> 00:37:31,173
Henry, when I'm finally ready
to throw in the towel,

359
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:32,969
Dr Jennings is your man.

360
00:37:33,103 --> 00:37:35,594
- Henry Beechwood.
- Ross Jennings.

361
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:39,349
- By all accounts, a fine physician.
- I'll remember that.

362
00:37:39,985 --> 00:37:42,061
This brings back memories.

363
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:45,405
Right after the war,
when I moved to Canaima,

364
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:47,739
the whole town threw me a party.

365
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:49,577
You threw yourself a party.

366
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:51,530
Now that was a party!

367
00:37:51,664 --> 00:37:54,036
Now that is a jerk!

368
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:27,730
- Canaima welcomes you.
- Thank you.

369
00:38:27,865 --> 00:38:30,072
Listen, I was interested in something.

370
00:38:30,202 --> 00:38:32,277
I wonder if you could
give me a little help.

371
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:35,530
Do you think
that I should have this removed?

372
00:38:35,664 --> 00:38:37,824
What's Bunny showing them over there?

373
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:40,960
Hand-to-hand combat techniques.

374
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:46,550
So Becky, have you thought about
what you'll major in at college?

375
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:47,755
Gym.

376
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:50,458
It's in the genes.

377
00:38:50,597 --> 00:38:53,514
Bobby here,
he's the Broncos' star quarterback.

378
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:58,599
I taught him to throw a football
before he could walk.

379
00:38:58,728 --> 00:39:00,271
I coach the team.

380
00:39:00,396 --> 00:39:02,023
Nepotism, huh?

381
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,023
Actually, we're Baptists.

382
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,072
Nobody comes up to a mortician
at a party and says,

383
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:11,771
"Irv, you think I might be dead?"

384
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:14,115
Must drive you nuts
trying to dip your Dorito

385
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:16,818
while somebody's showing you his growth.

386
00:39:16,956 --> 00:39:18,913
How do you handle it?

387
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:24,282
I just mention that until quite recently
my wife was a successful stockbroker.

388
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:28,255
Say, what do you think about that...

389
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:31,967
- Why shouldn't I have another?
- Because you've had too much already.

390
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,088
- Let's go.
- No, I'm thirsty.

391
00:39:34,222 --> 00:39:36,344
That's the Manleys.

392
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,882
Their son recently passed away.

393
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:40,478
That's awful. How?

394
00:39:40,603 --> 00:39:42,643
I'm not sure. He was a scientist.

395
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:44,266
Photographer.

396
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,606
He was on a scientific
expedition down in...

397
00:39:46,735 --> 00:39:48,478
Venezuela.

398
00:39:49,612 --> 00:39:52,233
Nobody'd tell me how.

399
00:39:52,364 --> 00:39:55,782
- Or even let me see him to say goodbye.
- Let's go.

400
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:08,130
I had to recommend a closed coffin.

401
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:10,711
His body looked all chewed up.

402
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,668
Drained.

403
00:40:12,802 --> 00:40:18,009
Like some vampire had had a go at him.
It was terrible.

404
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:23,018
Excuse us.

405
00:40:28,317 --> 00:40:32,777
I'll be you made enough friends today
to break Sam Metcalf's death-grip.

406
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:35,396
It was wonderful.
We can't thank you enough.

407
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:37,027
Nor I you.

408
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,780
Freeing me from those damn pills.

409
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:43,197
I feel I could compete in a triathlon.

410
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:46,166
On the basis of your check-up,
I tend to agree.

411
00:40:46,293 --> 00:40:48,286
- Bye-bye, Margaret.
- Bye, Molly.

412
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:55,210
Irv, Claire. Would you like a doggy bag?

413
00:40:55,344 --> 00:40:58,463
We're fine, thank you.
Great party, Margaret!

414
00:41:48,855 --> 00:41:50,976
Come on, honey. Party's over.

415
00:41:58,864 --> 00:42:01,900
Happy hunting, Felix.
See you in the morning.

416
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:39,059
You'd have had too much punch
and been the life of the party.

417
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:49,117
I missed you.

418
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:48,710
Ross!

419
00:43:56,521 --> 00:44:01,563
I could have killed one of you.
The nails came straight...

420
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,021
It's all rotten down there.

421
00:44:04,153 --> 00:44:07,985
My wine cellar is...
It's probably crawling with termites.

422
00:44:08,742 --> 00:44:11,197
I'm surprised
we haven't fallen through the floor.

423
00:44:11,327 --> 00:44:13,652
I'll call the exterminator.

424
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:21,534
You're rather casual
about the death of my dream.

425
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,422
I've been trying to reach Margaret
to thank her

426
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:26,340
and her line's been busy all morning.

427
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:28,838
She's probably gabbing.

428
00:44:29,427 --> 00:44:31,255
- You want me to...
- Would you?

429
00:44:31,389 --> 00:44:33,380
I'll go over and check on her.

430
00:44:57,956 --> 00:44:59,534
Margaret?

431
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,003
So what do you think, doc?

432
00:45:12,137 --> 00:45:13,880
Heart attack.

433
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:16,719
Bound to happen, rather sooner than later.

434
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:19,934
She had a history of high blood pressure.

435
00:45:20,061 --> 00:45:22,731
- Even with the pills I put her on...
- I took her off those.

436
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:25,097
What right did you have to do that?

437
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:27,059
She came to me. As a patient.

438
00:45:27,193 --> 00:45:29,400
You didn't notice she was hypertensive?

439
00:45:29,528 --> 00:45:31,900
Her diastolic reading was normal.

440
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:34,438
Her systolic elevation was below 160.

441
00:45:34,576 --> 00:45:38,074
- If you'd stayed current...
- This is a very serious matter, young man.

442
00:45:41,373 --> 00:45:45,668
- You may well have killed this woman.
- I don't think so. She was in fine shape.

443
00:45:45,795 --> 00:45:47,751
- I want an autopsy.
- Never.

444
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,338
Look, she was my patient.

445
00:45:49,465 --> 00:45:51,257
And mine for 40 years.

446
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,012
Margaret wouldn't want to be butchered.
And nobody here would want that for her.

447
00:45:56,137 --> 00:45:58,012
Give it to me, Irv.

448
00:45:58,141 --> 00:46:00,298
I'm satisfied if you're satisfied, doc.

449
00:46:00,434 --> 00:46:04,431
You come from a big city
where people don't care about each other.

450
00:46:04,563 --> 00:46:06,971
I don't expect you'd understand.

451
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,775
A little advice.

452
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:12,025
If you're ever going to fit in in Canaima,

453
00:46:12,153 --> 00:46:14,775
learn to be sensitive to
the feelings of the people here.

454
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:18,489
I'm sorry I'm more interested
in medicine than public relations!

455
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:22,367
You know, cardiac victims
don't usually bite their tongues off.

456
00:46:22,498 --> 00:46:25,248
It's as though she went
into titanic convulsions.

457
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:28,376
Until I know why, this case isn't closed.

458
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,869
You're damn right it's not. I believe
you may be guilty of medical malpractice.

459
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:35,925
And I intend to pursue the matter
to its conclusion.

460
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:50,516
Ross, I understand she was your patient.
Your only patient.

461
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:52,891
Why don't you come by the gym
tomorrow at 3.00?

462
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:54,605
It's a mile up the road from you.

463
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:56,563
I'll throw some business your way.

464
00:46:56,697 --> 00:46:58,440
Thank you, Henry.

465
00:46:58,574 --> 00:47:00,318
I appreciate that.

466
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:03,152
That was nice of him.

467
00:47:04,414 --> 00:47:06,702
Think he could have said
it a little louder?

468
00:47:23,181 --> 00:47:25,755
A little young, isn't it?

469
00:47:25,893 --> 00:47:27,221
The wine?

470
00:47:28,521 --> 00:47:31,972
No, Margaret. To die at 68.

471
00:47:35,402 --> 00:47:41,108
That's ten years below the life expectancy
of a Caucasian female. Did you know that?

472
00:47:43,242 --> 00:47:45,235
Ross, you're a fine doctor.

473
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:49,581
I'm sure you knew exactly what you were
doing when you took her off those pills.

474
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:52,626
Like I knew what I was doing
when I chose this town?

475
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:55,588
With the country doctor from hell.

476
00:47:55,713 --> 00:48:00,541
Or this fine house,
which is rotting from the ground up.

477
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,168
I'm gonna take care of that in the morning.

478
00:48:03,304 --> 00:48:06,554
Well, Margaret's still
gonna be dead in the morning.

479
00:48:10,603 --> 00:48:12,844
I still want to know what killed her.

480
00:48:30,456 --> 00:48:35,081
He was nailing something in the cellar
and the wood just disintegrated.

481
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:36,704
Termites, huh?

482
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:38,876
That's what my husband thought.

483
00:48:39,005 --> 00:48:43,418
- And he's an expert in these matters?
- Well... no.

484
00:48:43,552 --> 00:48:45,675
Didn't think so.

485
00:48:45,804 --> 00:48:48,213
I'm glad you called me.

486
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:53,728
No room for amateurs in this game.

487
00:49:13,331 --> 00:49:15,289
Thank you.

488
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,208
What is it?

489
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,583
It's hard to say.

490
00:49:24,717 --> 00:49:27,802
Would anybody object
if I tore this floor out?

491
00:49:27,929 --> 00:49:30,384
- I would.
- False alarm, then. Lead on.

492
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:33,807
How bad is it?

493
00:49:37,981 --> 00:49:39,853
I didn't find a thing. Go figure.

494
00:49:39,983 --> 00:49:42,735
Then why is all the wood rotting?

495
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,652
I'll tell you why.

496
00:49:45,987 --> 00:49:47,731
Bad wood.

497
00:49:47,864 --> 00:49:49,942
So... what do we do?

498
00:49:50,994 --> 00:49:53,282
Tear out bad wood.

499
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:55,204
Put in good wood.

500
00:49:57,125 --> 00:50:00,574
My husband thought
this would make a good wine cellar.

501
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,119
I collect beer cans myself.

502
00:50:03,255 --> 00:50:06,753
I got a rare '74 of Miller Lite
with a misprint on the label.

503
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:10,086
Only a hundred or so cans in circulation.

504
00:50:10,221 --> 00:50:12,461
The husband just might want to
take a gander.

505
00:50:12,597 --> 00:50:14,637
No hard shoes on the court.

506
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:16,639
Sorry.

507
00:50:16,768 --> 00:50:20,304
Look, I know what a blow
losing Margaret was for you.

508
00:50:20,438 --> 00:50:23,938
People keep score.
You're only as good as your last game.

509
00:50:24,067 --> 00:50:27,103
- Hell, I ought to know.
- I appreciate your concern, Henry.

510
00:50:27,237 --> 00:50:29,063
I want you to enjoy Canaima.

511
00:50:29,197 --> 00:50:30,940
Clean water, fresh air.

512
00:50:31,074 --> 00:50:33,862
Got no police sirens wailing all night.

513
00:50:33,994 --> 00:50:37,030
Just crickets.
We have crickets up the wazoo.

514
00:50:38,248 --> 00:50:42,625
Actually, I haven't heard any crickets
lately, now that you mention it.

515
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:44,876
Actually, I haven't either.

516
00:50:45,005 --> 00:50:46,795
Okay, Broncos, the doc's here!

517
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:48,998
Get ready to drop 'em.

518
00:50:50,092 --> 00:50:52,132
The doc wants to hear you cough.

519
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,793
You call yourself Broncos?

520
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:36,382
You look like a bunch of babies.
Come on!

521
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:54,400
You're moving in slow motion here.

522
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:09,076
That's supposed to be a banana out.
Looks like a banana split!

523
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:10,871
- Shitty pass.
- I heard that!

524
00:52:11,005 --> 00:52:12,664
What are you, a garbage mouth?

525
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:14,422
Hit the showers.

526
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,210
Wash that mouth out. Miller!

527
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:20,840
- You know the patterns?
- Like the back of my hand.

528
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:24,971
Get in here. Run the same thing again.
Hurry up.

529
00:52:25,103 --> 00:52:28,306
Come on, Miller.
We're waiting on you, let's go!

530
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,431
Come on! Move it! You wanna play?

531
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:32,523
Come on, run. Let's go.

532
00:52:33,527 --> 00:52:34,902
Thanks.

533
00:52:35,655 --> 00:52:37,445
Run it.

534
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,585
Up. Let's go.

535
00:52:57,384 --> 00:52:59,626
Miller, you all right?

536
00:52:59,762 --> 00:53:02,251
- Coach!
- What's wrong with Miller?

537
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:06,016
Back up, let him breathe.

538
00:53:06,143 --> 00:53:08,219
What's wrong? What is it?

539
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:10,143
Come on, give us some air.

540
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:15,068
Let's get his helmet off.

541
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:18,443
Real easy. Support his head, coach.

542
00:53:18,572 --> 00:53:20,610
Real gentle.

543
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:43,550
From what I hear,
it wasn't a very hard tackle.

544
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:46,635
I only wish I knew, you see

545
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:49,601
Dr Jennings examined him last.

546
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,233
Why so gloomy?

547
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:10,197
Bunny Beechwood says that
everybody's calling you Dr Death.

548
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,871
That's just silly, Shelley.

549
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,543
And they say you want to
cut people up into little pieces.

550
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,746
Tom, look...

551
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,541
It's called an autopsy.

552
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,672
It's not a very pleasant thing,

553
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:29,797
but sometimes it's the only way to find out
what really happened to a person.

554
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:33,266
But some doctors who should know better
won't accept that.

555
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:36,807
But some doctors who should know better
just won't accept

556
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,106
that their big-city methods
don't sit well in a small town.

557
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:44,989
Both Margaret and that poor boy
did seem to be quite healthy.

558
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:47,735
It's a bit odd, don't you think, Sam?

559
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,536
If I autopsied everyone
who ever died of a heart attack

560
00:54:50,661 --> 00:54:53,614
I'd be run out of Canaima so fast...

561
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:57,793
Poor Sam. You still think life is
a popularity contest.

562
00:54:59,795 --> 00:55:02,831
You're not jealous of
our new young doctor, are you?

563
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:04,708
What?

564
00:55:04,842 --> 00:55:06,751
Now you made me lose my timing.

565
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,545
You're yelling, Sam.

566
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:11,715
Come on to bed.

567
00:55:14,518 --> 00:55:16,557
I need a shower.

568
00:55:16,686 --> 00:55:20,222
I'd love to start taking walks
around the neighbourhood with you.

569
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,813
It's not the same thing, Evelyn.

570
00:55:22,943 --> 00:55:25,233
I need to know exactly how far I've gone

571
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:28,769
and exactly how long it took me.

572
00:55:28,907 --> 00:55:30,733
Floor's cold, Sam.

573
00:55:30,867 --> 00:55:33,903
You're right. You're always right.

574
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:40,831
Damn!

575
00:55:41,545 --> 00:55:44,463
- What's wrong?
- Some damn thing bit me.

576
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:49,086
It's just a spider.

577
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:51,757
Spider? Felt like a damn cougar.

578
00:55:51,889 --> 00:55:53,168
Damn!

579
00:55:56,518 --> 00:55:58,096
I'm having a seizure.

580
00:55:58,228 --> 00:56:00,434
Sam, what should I do?

581
00:56:00,563 --> 00:56:02,806
Ambulance. Call Jennings.

582
00:56:09,864 --> 00:56:11,608
I'll be right there.

583
00:56:13,576 --> 00:56:16,695
- What's going on?
- Metcalf. He's having a seizure.

584
00:56:17,704 --> 00:56:20,112
<i>Thank God you didn't
examine him this morning.</i>

585
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,789
- What's the coroner doing here?
- I don't know.

586
00:56:29,007 --> 00:56:30,965
Milt! This isn't necessary.

587
00:56:31,092 --> 00:56:33,217
I'll be the judge of that, Lloyd.

588
00:56:33,346 --> 00:56:35,137
Wait out here.

589
00:56:35,264 --> 00:56:38,467
Guard the house or something.

590
00:56:41,103 --> 00:56:43,559
Was he alive when you got here?

591
00:56:44,398 --> 00:56:47,483
He'd been dead maybe five minutes.

592
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:50,099
Whatever it was, it was abrupt and acute.

593
00:56:51,155 --> 00:56:55,068
What's your guess? Massive coronary?
Cerebral haemorrhage?

594
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:58,403
His wife says he was bitten by a spider
just before he seized.

595
00:56:59,746 --> 00:57:01,702
Oh, right.

596
00:57:01,831 --> 00:57:04,121
Sam told me about you.

597
00:57:04,251 --> 00:57:07,784
You're the hot shot who won't accept
anyone else's diagnosis.

598
00:57:08,963 --> 00:57:11,253
I'll accept it if I agree with it.

599
00:57:12,092 --> 00:57:13,253
Good.

600
00:57:13,385 --> 00:57:15,673
Let me show you something.

601
00:57:15,804 --> 00:57:17,463
Down here.

602
00:57:20,766 --> 00:57:22,760
I believe that's a spider bite.

603
00:57:25,313 --> 00:57:27,186
I'll buy that.

604
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:29,224
But I rather doubt that's what killed him

605
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,023
In twenty years,
I've seen only one spider-bite fatality.

606
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:36,487
And that involved a black widow
and a one-year-old child.

607
00:57:36,615 --> 00:57:40,695
No. My guess is that
Sam overexerted himself.

608
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:44,244
His wife said he was using the treadmill
just before he keeled over.

609
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:46,829
You may be right.

610
00:57:47,876 --> 00:57:49,251
I want a full autopsy.

611
00:57:49,378 --> 00:57:52,545
Tissue samples, blood toxicology,
the whole nine yards.

612
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:54,666
- Wait just one second.
- Shut up, Lloyd.

613
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,586
- You'll get Evelyn's permission, of course.
- Of course.

614
00:57:57,719 --> 00:58:00,755
- You need a ride home?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

615
00:58:00,889 --> 00:58:04,342
You better take care of yourself now.
You're the town doctor.

616
00:58:04,936 --> 00:58:06,559
Say "Aahh."

617
00:58:09,356 --> 00:58:13,603
Okay, I think we're gonna
treat this inflammation with antibiotics.

618
00:58:15,903 --> 00:58:18,311
Does this mean
I don't get any ice cream?

619
00:58:18,449 --> 00:58:20,440
I'll buy you a double scoop
on the way home.

620
00:58:20,576 --> 00:58:22,402
Who's next?

621
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:25,027
I'll take that. Thank you very much.

622
00:58:25,164 --> 00:58:27,239
Step right this way.

623
00:58:27,373 --> 00:58:29,532
Just have a seat. I'll be right with you.

624
00:58:34,797 --> 00:58:36,956
Okay, hot shot. Are you sitting down?

625
00:58:37,884 --> 00:58:41,420
According to preliminary data,
Sam Metcalf died as the result of

626
00:58:41,554 --> 00:58:46,512
a minute amount of an as yet unidentified
toxic substance in his bloodstream.

627
00:58:47,311 --> 00:58:51,260
<i>My office isn't ruling out accidental
poisoning, deliberate poisoning</i>

628
00:58:51,396 --> 00:58:53,769
<i>or even killer spiders.</i>

629
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,896
<i>At the moment,
it looks like a heart attack to me.</i>

630
00:58:58,028 --> 00:59:00,815
<i>But I'll support whatever
you'd like to do.</i>

631
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:03,570
I gotta have those bodies exhumed.

632
00:59:03,701 --> 00:59:06,275
I gotta be sure.

633
00:59:06,413 --> 00:59:07,871
Okay.

634
00:59:08,623 --> 00:59:10,829
Whatever you think is necessary.

635
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:12,121
Thanks.

636
00:59:12,251 --> 00:59:13,876
Are you out of your mind?

637
00:59:14,003 --> 00:59:16,291
Slowly and once more, Lloyd...

638
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:20,086
I want Margaret Hollins'
and Todd Miller's bodies exhumed.

639
00:59:20,217 --> 00:59:21,960
Dug up.

640
00:59:25,139 --> 00:59:29,135
You start pulling citizens out of the
ground that should be enjoying eternal rest

641
00:59:29,268 --> 00:59:31,427
and that roomful of patients
will disappear...

642
00:59:31,561 --> 00:59:35,641
I'll just get a court order.
Milt Briggs is on my side.

643
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:42,655
This is a very bad business,
Mr Yale-graduate-big-city doctor!

644
00:59:42,782 --> 00:59:44,820
A very bad business!

645
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:46,443
No shit!

646
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:00,454
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

647
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:01,835
What's going on?

648
01:00:01,967 --> 01:00:04,967
I promised Shelley
she could spend the night with Bunny.

649
01:00:05,094 --> 01:00:07,336
We'll take good care of her.

650
01:00:11,851 --> 01:00:13,429
Wait.

651
01:00:14,438 --> 01:00:18,849
There may be some spiders around here
that are very dangerous.

652
01:00:18,983 --> 01:00:21,356
Okay? I just want you girls
to be aware of this.

653
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:25,235
If you should see one,
don't try to capture it or kill it.

654
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:29,320
Just run, you understand?

655
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:35,405
- Run!
- We'll do that, Dr Jennings.

656
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:38,246
You don't have to worry about anything.

657
01:00:38,378 --> 01:00:40,001
Dr Death!

658
01:00:44,175 --> 01:00:46,297
Are you all right?

659
01:00:46,427 --> 01:00:48,003
No.

660
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,811
All clear.

661
01:01:07,614 --> 01:01:10,614
The spider didn't answer.
She had fallen asleep.

662
01:01:10,742 --> 01:01:14,193
It had been a very, very busy day.

663
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:16,036
Okay, your turn, Bunny.

664
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:20,742
The itsy bitsy spider

665
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:24,831
Crawled up the water spout

666
01:01:24,963 --> 01:01:29,626
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out

667
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:35,050
Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain

668
01:01:35,182 --> 01:01:40,722
And the itsy bitsy spider
crawled up the spout again

669
01:01:41,106 --> 01:01:43,311
It's my turn now.

670
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,931
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet

671
01:01:46,068 --> 01:01:48,309
Eating her curds and whey

672
01:01:48,445 --> 01:01:50,818
And along came a spider

673
01:01:50,949 --> 01:01:53,237
That sat down beside her

674
01:01:53,367 --> 01:01:55,159
And frightened Miss Muffet...

675
01:01:56,161 --> 01:01:59,744
If you girls don't settle down
then Shelley can't stay over any more.

676
01:01:59,873 --> 01:02:02,447
- We can't sleep.
- We keep scaring each other.

677
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:05,076
Why don't you two
go sleep in my room for a while?

678
01:02:05,213 --> 01:02:07,668
Okay. Nah, we don't need this.

679
01:03:09,608 --> 01:03:11,898
Son of a bitch.

680
01:03:15,155 --> 01:03:17,824
Where are all the other crickets?

681
01:03:17,951 --> 01:03:19,989
Where are all your buddies?

682
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:51,601
Atherton.

683
01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:53,726
Yes, Dr Atherton.

684
01:03:54,527 --> 01:03:56,188
I'm Ross Jennings.

685
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,858
I'm a general practitioner, and I...

686
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:03,117
I have a problem
that may be spider-related.

687
01:04:03,244 --> 01:04:05,914
You seem to be the foremost authority
on the West Coast.

688
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:08,744
Or any coast, for that matter.

689
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:11,248
Dr Jennings, let me tell you that

690
01:04:11,378 --> 01:04:15,706
every so often in a little town somewhere
there is a health scare,

691
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,967
some unexplained outbreak,
and spiders make convenient culprits.

692
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:23,257
<i>Did you know that on
every suburban acre</i>

693
01:04:23,389 --> 01:04:26,840
there are at least 50 to 60,000 spiders?

694
01:04:26,976 --> 01:04:31,188
And that each spider eats
about 100 insects per year?

695
01:04:32,065 --> 01:04:36,726
<i>That means at least 5 million insects
are consumed per acre annually.</i>

696
01:04:37,903 --> 01:04:39,896
Think about it, doctor.

697
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:43,898
<i>Perhaps man might find the planet
uninhabitable without spiders.</i>

698
01:04:44,034 --> 01:04:46,608
<i>Dr Atherton,
I have nothing against spiders.</i>

699
01:04:46,744 --> 01:04:48,987
<i>It's just we have had three deaths
in my town</i>

700
01:04:49,123 --> 01:04:51,411
<i>and I'm afraid
there's going to be some more.</i>

701
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:55,077
<i>If you could lend me your expertise,
forjust an afternoon...</i>

702
01:04:55,213 --> 01:04:58,663
We're really not that far from you.
It's a town called Canaima.

703
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,130
<i>You know it?</i>

704
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,170
It's familiar.

705
01:05:04,929 --> 01:05:07,800
Let me see what I can do.
Where are you exactly?

706
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:19,690
Collins?

707
01:05:21,445 --> 01:05:23,688
- Sorry.
- Are you equally busy tomorrow?

708
01:05:45,969 --> 01:05:47,380
Dr Atherton?

709
01:05:47,512 --> 01:05:50,052
No, I'm Chris Collins,
one of his assistants.

710
01:05:50,182 --> 01:05:52,851
Hi, I'm Chris.
Atherton's really busy lately.

711
01:05:52,976 --> 01:05:57,853
He's recently discovered a new species
of spider. Down in South America.

712
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:00,893
To us, it's a big deal.

713
01:06:02,612 --> 01:06:06,193
I hope you'll be able to help us.
We're going to be examining some bodies.

714
01:06:06,322 --> 01:06:08,815
It sounds like a blast.

715
01:06:09,827 --> 01:06:11,818
We're looking for bites.

716
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:16,405
Like this. That's a spider, isn't it?

717
01:06:19,335 --> 01:06:20,960
I'm not sure.

718
01:06:21,088 --> 01:06:23,376
I think so.

719
01:06:23,507 --> 01:06:26,460
<i>But even at several times
the potency of latrodectus.</i>

720
01:06:27,635 --> 01:06:29,130
- Black widow, right?
- Right.

721
01:06:29,262 --> 01:06:31,753
Even then it would take
more than one bite to kill,

722
01:06:31,891 --> 01:06:36,967
so I figure this guy's death and the spider
bite, if it a spider bite, are coincidental.

723
01:06:37,603 --> 01:06:39,514
Hey, guys, how's it going?

724
01:06:40,773 --> 01:06:42,682
Poor Margaret.

725
01:06:42,817 --> 01:06:45,818
She was a good wife, good teacher,
good neighbour.

726
01:06:47,155 --> 01:06:48,697
Excellent cook.

727
01:06:48,822 --> 01:06:50,817
Anything you want, just shout.

728
01:06:54,369 --> 01:06:55,829
I want some fresh air.

729
01:06:55,954 --> 01:06:58,327
Chris, come here.

730
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:06,210
Still think it's a coincidence?

731
01:07:07,382 --> 01:07:09,257
That's a spider bite.

732
01:07:09,385 --> 01:07:11,673
The tissue surrounding the bite
is macerated.

733
01:07:11,804 --> 01:07:13,215
Found one.

734
01:07:13,347 --> 01:07:15,007
A mark behind the left ear.

735
01:07:21,231 --> 01:07:24,016
<i>- Atherton.
- Dr Atherton, Chris Collins.</i>

736
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:26,516
<i>I think we've got a big problem
here in Canaima.</i>

737
01:07:26,652 --> 01:07:28,110
<i>They've got three dead bodies.</i>

738
01:07:28,237 --> 01:07:32,733
<i>The cause of death seems to be a spider
more deadly than any I've ever seen.</i>

739
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:36,032
<i>They want the okay
to quarantine the town.</i>

740
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:39,827
- Are you sure?
- This is way out of my league.

741
01:07:39,956 --> 01:07:43,407
I think you'd better come up here
right away.

742
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:48,340
I can be there tomorrow afternoon.

743
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:51,798
But Collins, try and find me a specimen.

744
01:09:16,926 --> 01:09:18,717
Did you bring the keys?

745
01:09:18,845 --> 01:09:20,007
Great.

746
01:09:20,137 --> 01:09:21,965
Perk up, Lloyd.

747
01:09:22,097 --> 01:09:25,100
If we find the spider that did this,
you can arrest him.

748
01:09:37,613 --> 01:09:40,567
Milt, why don't you cover the living room?

749
01:09:42,202 --> 01:09:44,278
Chris, why don't you check out back?

750
01:09:45,954 --> 01:09:48,956
Lloyd, take the kitchen.

751
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:54,286
And I'll just... I'll oversee the...
I'll just coordinate the...

752
01:09:56,048 --> 01:09:57,591
I'll just stay right here.

753
01:11:08,453 --> 01:11:10,362
What is all that crap?

754
01:11:10,496 --> 01:11:13,581
Leftovers.
Mostly cricket parts, wings, legs.

755
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,578
We haven't heard any crickets in Canaima
these past few weeks.

756
01:11:28,014 --> 01:11:29,720
Ross, here!

757
01:11:29,849 --> 01:11:31,128
Don't move!

758
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:35,801
- It's dead. Shit!
- What could have killed it?

759
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:39,099
The shock of seeing Lloyd?

760
01:11:47,658 --> 01:11:49,947
There are other people in this house.

761
01:11:50,077 --> 01:11:51,985
Dad, go away!

762
01:11:55,332 --> 01:11:57,787
Use the one down here!

763
01:12:59,103 --> 01:13:01,141
Never a moment's peace.

764
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,979
What happened? Are you all right?

765
01:13:15,953 --> 01:13:18,953
Why don't we just take the dead spider
and get out of here?

766
01:13:19,081 --> 01:13:22,994
You don't get off that easy. It's already
desiccated. It wouldn't be any use to us.

767
01:13:23,127 --> 01:13:24,953
You mean macerated.

768
01:13:25,087 --> 01:13:28,372
No, I mean desiccated.
Dried up, drained of all its blood.

769
01:13:28,506 --> 01:13:31,045
Macerated is the... chewing that they do.

770
01:13:34,262 --> 01:13:36,800
They're like little vampires.

771
01:13:36,931 --> 01:13:39,966
This trip of Atherton's to find
the spider species, where'd he go?

772
01:13:40,101 --> 01:13:42,342
South America.

773
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:44,055
Venezuela, why?

774
01:13:50,028 --> 01:13:51,819
Is that one of them?

775
01:13:51,945 --> 01:13:53,855
I'd say it's a damn fine suspect.

776
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:07,079
Ross, you're going to have
to take a step towards it.

777
01:14:10,463 --> 01:14:13,880
- Chris, I'm scared to death.
- We all are.

778
01:14:14,009 --> 01:14:18,755
But our brains secrete a neurotransmitter
that enables us to deal with them.

779
01:14:18,889 --> 01:14:22,055
I don't think I have
that particular neurotransmitter.

780
01:14:22,976 --> 01:14:24,256
Yes, you do.

781
01:14:50,878 --> 01:14:52,502
You need an asbestos glove.

782
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:55,203
Doomsday weapon in Delbert's war
on a creepy crawler.

783
01:14:55,341 --> 01:14:59,969
I coat it with Demon EC,
insecticide with environmental conscience.

784
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:03,050
It's biodegradable. Organic.

785
01:15:03,182 --> 01:15:07,761
You ought to see the little beasties twitch
when they get a whiff of this stuff.

786
01:15:15,987 --> 01:15:17,778
Now, Delbert...

787
01:15:20,198 --> 01:15:24,149
There's a rumour going around that
some kind of spider killed Sam Metcalf.

788
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,658
Maybe Margaret, maybe even my Bronco.

789
01:15:27,832 --> 01:15:29,326
<i>Doubtful, Henry.</i>

790
01:15:29,832 --> 01:15:34,377
In a case in Florida one of my colleagues
bumped into a nest of black widows.

791
01:15:34,505 --> 01:15:36,961
Sustained over a dozen bites and lived.

792
01:15:42,721 --> 01:15:47,761
Of course, he probably lost control
of all of his bodily functions.

793
01:15:47,893 --> 01:15:49,552
There's no spider here.

794
01:15:49,686 --> 01:15:52,640
But I will hunt down the alleged arachnid

795
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:55,350
<i>and spritz him to kingdom come.</i>

796
01:16:39,735 --> 01:16:41,894
Yeah, that's right.

797
01:16:42,029 --> 01:16:43,226
I'm bad.

798
01:16:52,414 --> 01:16:54,407
Dr Atherton, Ross Jennings.

799
01:16:56,543 --> 01:16:58,252
Come in.

800
01:16:58,712 --> 01:17:01,037
Did you find me another specimen?

801
01:17:01,172 --> 01:17:03,961
Yes, I did.
I also paid a call to the town mortician.

802
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:07,179
Several months ago, there was a corpse.

803
01:17:07,304 --> 01:17:10,804
The body was desiccated,
it was totally drained of blood.

804
01:17:10,932 --> 01:17:12,971
Irv agreed that
if the spider was big enough

805
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:17,015
and it spent a long enough time
working on that body...

806
01:17:17,146 --> 01:17:20,064
I think I know
why you've heard of Canaima.

807
01:17:20,775 --> 01:17:22,814
This was Jerry Manley's home town.

808
01:17:24,988 --> 01:17:26,980
- Manley the photographer?
- Yeah.

809
01:17:27,408 --> 01:17:31,618
I think one of your Venezuelan spiders
hitched a ride here in Manley's coffin.

810
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:41,368
The fangs, the injectors,
are disproportionately large.

811
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,828
Three poison sacs.

812
01:17:44,675 --> 01:17:46,631
Now, let's test the venom.

813
01:17:54,475 --> 01:17:59,054
The nature of the toxin and the amount
injected determine the effect of the bite.

814
01:17:59,189 --> 01:18:02,390
And, of course, the place
where the subject is bitten.

815
01:18:02,524 --> 01:18:05,443
It can lead to paralysis or death.

816
01:18:15,203 --> 01:18:19,202
I'm no expert, but I'd guess this toxin
is fatal at a fraction of that dose.

817
01:18:19,332 --> 01:18:20,993
I'd agree.

818
01:18:27,716 --> 01:18:29,875
No sex organs.

819
01:18:30,761 --> 01:18:32,800
That would make them drones.

820
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:36,090
Or soldiers.

821
01:18:36,809 --> 01:18:40,722
That's typically seen in highly organised
insect societies - bees, ants...

822
01:18:40,854 --> 01:18:44,056
but we've never seen it in spiders.

823
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:46,681
- I have.
- Venezuela, right?

824
01:18:47,152 --> 01:18:49,440
Right. This is the descendant.

825
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:53,403
Somehow that South American male
has mated with a domestic house spider

826
01:18:53,533 --> 01:18:55,822
and created a very deadly strain.

827
01:18:55,952 --> 01:18:58,823
But if it has no sex organs,
it can't reproduce, right?

828
01:18:58,956 --> 01:19:03,082
True, and the accelerated growth rate,
combined with the specialisation,

829
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:05,747
suggests a short life cycle.

830
01:19:05,878 --> 01:19:08,167
We've already seen a dead one.

831
01:19:08,297 --> 01:19:12,377
- That could be the good news.
- Now let's discuss the bad.

832
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:14,003
In their own ecosystem,

833
01:19:14,136 --> 01:19:18,798
the species I discovered in South America
live at the top of the food chain.

834
01:19:18,932 --> 01:19:24,686
The spread out from a central nest in a
web-like pattern and dominate the area.

835
01:19:24,814 --> 01:19:29,725
But in their original habitat, geography
contains them. That isn't true here.

836
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:33,311
So the original male's
the grandaddy of them all.

837
01:19:33,447 --> 01:19:37,694
And he's acting like a general
sending his troops to battle.

838
01:19:37,827 --> 01:19:39,284
Excuse me.

839
01:19:39,869 --> 01:19:42,362
Professor? This is our town exterminator.

840
01:19:42,497 --> 01:19:46,364
McClintock, infestation management.
Always nice to meet a colleague.

841
01:19:46,501 --> 01:19:50,250
He believes he came across one of the
offending spiders a couple of hours ago.

842
01:19:50,381 --> 01:19:52,917
Might you have brought it with you?

843
01:19:53,048 --> 01:19:56,300
Actually, he's probably still
on the bottom of my shoe.

844
01:19:57,011 --> 01:20:00,427
You really can't tell what it is any more.

845
01:20:01,641 --> 01:20:05,805
In this first generation,
the original male also produced a queen.

846
01:20:05,938 --> 01:20:10,681
Together they will construct a primary
nest, which the queen will guard.

847
01:20:10,817 --> 01:20:14,814
But eventually she will create
reproductive offspring of her own.

848
01:20:14,945 --> 01:20:17,863
When that happens, this town is dead.

849
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:22,034
And the next town, and the next town.
And the next one and so on.

850
01:20:22,162 --> 01:20:25,162
Irv owns the mortuary
where it must have originated.

851
01:20:25,289 --> 01:20:28,740
- If we go in and destroy the original male...
- And the primary nest.

852
01:20:28,876 --> 01:20:32,458
- I'll call the Department of Agriculture.
- There's phones in the office.

853
01:20:32,588 --> 01:20:36,917
- I'll see you later at the mortuary.
- Sheriff, you'll give me a ride.

854
01:20:37,051 --> 01:20:38,759
I am not a chauffeur.

855
01:20:38,886 --> 01:20:40,926
- Shut up.
- Damn, it's busy!

856
01:20:41,055 --> 01:20:44,470
<i>Irv and Blaire always take the phone off
the hook during Wheel Of Fortune.</i>

857
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,759
Let's get the hell over there.

858
01:21:08,082 --> 01:21:11,082
Blaire, real butter or fake butter?

859
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:12,668
Fake.

860
01:21:16,881 --> 01:21:20,048
- Irv, hurry.
- Buttery, hot and delicious!

861
01:21:37,485 --> 01:21:39,524
He needs to buy a vowel.

862
01:21:45,827 --> 01:21:47,783
Buy a vowel.

863
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:55,208
Delbert!

864
01:22:00,341 --> 01:22:03,212
What's this nest?
What's it gonna look like?

865
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:09,048
You'd know it if you found it.
The area would be dark, warm, moist.

866
01:22:09,975 --> 01:22:13,060
It'd be kind of a musty smell
and you'd probably see an egg sac.

867
01:22:13,186 --> 01:22:15,475
Like your basic egg sac.

868
01:22:15,605 --> 01:22:19,984
White, cocooned, pulsating,
about the size of a softball.

869
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:23,436
Of course, there'd be
no other spiders around.

870
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:25,149
What do you mean?

871
01:22:25,282 --> 01:22:30,407
Spiders are cannibals, so she wouldn't
want any others near her offspring.

872
01:22:31,997 --> 01:22:36,872
Yes, tell them exactly what I've told you.
Even if it is interrupting a dinner party.

873
01:22:37,002 --> 01:22:38,545
Sheriff?

874
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:47,337
Where is this?

875
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:50,175
It's the old Daniels place.
Jennings bought it.

876
01:22:50,305 --> 01:22:52,216
Take me there.

877
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:16,581
Hey, Irv!

878
01:23:17,876 --> 01:23:19,286
Ross.

879
01:23:20,293 --> 01:23:21,918
Canaima welcomes you.

880
01:23:22,046 --> 01:23:25,497
Irv, we have an emergency!

881
01:23:45,027 --> 01:23:46,734
I'll get us into the mortuary.

882
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:50,404
Ross!

883
01:24:20,103 --> 01:24:21,894
We've found it.

884
01:24:25,942 --> 01:24:30,271
Please go back to the mortuary and round
up my assistant and that exterminator.

885
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:32,895
All right, I'll do that.

886
01:24:33,032 --> 01:24:37,113
Meanwhile, just stay here, sir, because
I'm not going to be responsible for...

887
01:24:37,244 --> 01:24:38,654
Fine.

888
01:24:53,011 --> 01:24:56,592
The killings have been so arbitrary.
Maybe there's more than one nest.

889
01:24:56,721 --> 01:24:58,300
No, there's just that one.

890
01:24:58,431 --> 01:24:59,842
What was it Atherton said?

891
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:02,929
They radiate out from a central nest.
You got a map of this town?

892
01:25:03,061 --> 01:25:06,099
- Thinking about buying here?
- Just get a map, please.

893
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:08,228
Here.

894
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:10,600
The Kendalls' house.

895
01:25:10,735 --> 01:25:13,024
Mark that down on there.

896
01:25:13,154 --> 01:25:14,565
All-righty.

897
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:16,820
And the old guy, the doctor.

898
01:25:16,949 --> 01:25:18,493
Metcalf.

899
01:25:18,618 --> 01:25:21,109
- The football kid?
- Died behind the high school.

900
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:25,161
Right here. This is fun.
I found one at Beechwood's.

901
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:27,617
- The old lady, what was her name?
- Margaret.

902
01:25:27,752 --> 01:25:30,042
- Is that all of them?
- Yeah, that's it.

903
01:25:30,171 --> 01:25:32,662
This here in the centre,
that's the mortuary, right?

904
01:25:32,798 --> 01:25:35,836
- No, that's a house.
- Who the hell lives there?

905
01:25:36,636 --> 01:25:38,095
I do.

906
01:25:45,228 --> 01:25:48,431
The whole time the nest was
in my own goddamn barn!

907
01:25:48,564 --> 01:25:50,024
I doubt that, doc.

908
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:53,814
Your basic spider'd find your old barn
a tad breezy this time of year.

909
01:25:53,944 --> 01:25:56,863
In that respect, spiders are
a bit like you and me.

910
01:25:56,989 --> 01:25:59,278
I frankly doubt the nest is in the barn.

911
01:25:59,408 --> 01:26:00,951
I frankly know it is.

912
01:26:01,077 --> 01:26:02,702
I was in the barn. I saw a web.

913
01:26:02,828 --> 01:26:04,702
There's a web in the barn.

914
01:26:04,829 --> 01:26:07,322
A web would indicate
an arachnoid presence.

915
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:11,537
They got a saying,
I believe it's in the Benelux countries...

916
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:15,087
Just drive, Delbert.
Just drive and get us there, please.

917
01:26:34,525 --> 01:26:37,195
My, you've been busy!

918
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,814
Incredible.

919
01:27:06,765 --> 01:27:09,257
Supper's ready.

920
01:27:09,394 --> 01:27:10,639
Come and get it.

921
01:27:26,411 --> 01:27:29,779
I gotta get my family out.
Destroy whatever's in the barn.

922
01:27:29,913 --> 01:27:33,199
Check. Better uncork my private stock.

923
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:37,711
- Chris, there may be spiders in the house.
- They're probably... All right, let's go.

924
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:47,970
Give me a minute to look around out here and
then we go in, nice and easy, all right?

925
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,559
Hel-lo!

926
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,279
Trick or treat.

927
01:28:16,251 --> 01:28:17,626
Gotcha!

928
01:28:22,298 --> 01:28:24,623
Let's see what we got up here.

929
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,523
Oh, my God. They got the professor.

930
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,145
Honey?

931
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:52,360
- We're in here, Ross.
- Hi, Dad.

932
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:04,878
I expected you home for dinner.
I got worried, I called the office.

933
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,462
Sorry, I didn't get a chance to call.

934
01:29:19,813 --> 01:29:22,483
Okay, everyb...

935
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:39,405
Everybody just get up very slowly.

936
01:29:47,923 --> 01:29:50,000
And walk towards the door.

937
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:56,677
Okay, quick and quiet.

938
01:29:56,807 --> 01:29:59,096
We're gonna need another way out of here.

939
01:30:02,521 --> 01:30:05,855
Upstairs, up into the bathroom.
We can climb out onto the roof.

940
01:30:10,237 --> 01:30:12,146
Watch yourself, Ross.

941
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:15,699
Come on, Shelley.

942
01:30:21,998 --> 01:30:22,863
Come on.

943
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:25,662
This doesn't make sense.
They're swarming.

944
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:28,250
I've never seen them this aggressive.

945
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,207
Hi, you guys, I'm Chris.

946
01:30:34,094 --> 01:30:36,420
Put that under the door, quick!

947
01:30:42,936 --> 01:30:44,845
Get it off me!

948
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:49,725
- Come on, Shelley.
- One at a time.

949
01:30:52,945 --> 01:30:54,904
Down the trellis, honey.

950
01:30:56,658 --> 01:30:58,649
Get out of there.

951
01:31:04,791 --> 01:31:06,913
Ross, get out of there.

952
01:31:11,881 --> 01:31:14,170
- Where's Ross?
- Right behind me.

953
01:31:14,301 --> 01:31:15,581
Oh, no!

954
01:31:21,099 --> 01:31:22,640
Shit!

955
01:31:25,311 --> 01:31:27,304
Mom, spiders!

956
01:31:27,438 --> 01:31:29,180
Shelley, Tommy, come here quick!

957
01:31:29,314 --> 01:31:31,889
- Kids, come on.
- Get 'em away from the house.

958
01:31:39,574 --> 01:31:41,613
Rock 'n' roll.

959
01:31:44,247 --> 01:31:46,404
All right, it's party time.

960
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:52,496
Take that!

961
01:32:55,733 --> 01:33:00,608
What is it?
Musty smell, moist, dark, no spiders.

962
01:33:02,029 --> 01:33:03,359
There's no spiders.

963
01:33:04,408 --> 01:33:07,444
It's dark, musty. The nest!

964
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:12,157
Nest. The queen.

965
01:33:15,418 --> 01:33:17,875
Shit, I'm in the goddamn nest!

966
01:33:19,547 --> 01:33:21,873
Help!

967
01:33:26,429 --> 01:33:28,007
Chris!

968
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:29,966
I found the nest!

969
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,387
And I saw the queen!

970
01:33:34,604 --> 01:33:36,099
Shit!

971
01:34:32,368 --> 01:34:34,197
Come on.

972
01:35:01,189 --> 01:35:02,849
Therapy.

973
01:35:12,283 --> 01:35:14,109
That's your basic egg sac.

974
01:35:26,922 --> 01:35:28,582
Be right back.

975
01:36:24,771 --> 01:36:27,974
Where is it?
That was the goddamn general!

976
01:36:30,485 --> 01:36:32,442
Help!

977
01:37:16,988 --> 01:37:19,112
Not the Château.

978
01:38:39,987 --> 01:38:42,275
Goddamn it, where are you?

979
01:38:43,073 --> 01:38:44,864
Damn it!

980
01:39:06,595 --> 01:39:11,804
The itsy bitsy spider
climbed up the water spout

981
01:39:11,935 --> 01:39:16,893
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out

982
01:39:23,529 --> 01:39:25,521
Come on, come on.

983
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,545
Shit!

984
01:41:31,029 --> 01:41:32,773
Nice shot.

985
01:41:35,574 --> 01:41:37,153
Thank God.

986
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:40,828
Don't mention it.

987
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:58,509
It's okay. Everything's okay.

988
01:41:59,681 --> 01:42:02,256
- Oh, God, the spider...
- It's okay.

989
01:42:02,394 --> 01:42:05,429
Most of them are dead.
The ones Delbert didn't get are dying.

990
01:42:05,563 --> 01:42:08,931
- Where are the kids?
- The kids are fine. Everybody's okay.

991
01:42:19,618 --> 01:42:26,119
<i>@ I left my heart</i>

992
01:42:28,335 --> 01:42:32,913
<i>@ In San Francisco</i>

993
01:42:37,302 --> 01:42:39,509
<i>@ High on a hill</i>

994
01:42:40,555 --> 01:42:43,261
You know what I'll miss most
about the country?

995
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:46,427
- What?
- I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.

996
01:42:48,313 --> 01:42:50,390
At least we got out with our lives.

997
01:42:50,524 --> 01:42:51,983
Yes.

998
01:42:53,652 --> 01:42:55,728
And the Margaux.

999
01:42:57,823 --> 01:43:00,859
To office politics, Christmas bonuses,

1000
01:43:00,992 --> 01:43:03,234
caffeine, adrenaline.

1001
01:43:03,369 --> 01:43:07,118
To things that we know,
to events that we can control.

1002
01:43:07,247 --> 01:43:08,791
To...

1003
01:43:20,177 --> 01:43:22,668
- Okay, that was a minor tremor.
- I barely felt it.

1004
01:43:22,805 --> 01:43:25,046
Probably wouldn't even show up
on that scale.

1005
01:43:25,182 --> 01:43:26,559
Richter scale.

1006
01:43:26,685 --> 01:43:28,890
Just a cable car going by.

1007
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:31,475
We should check the kids.
