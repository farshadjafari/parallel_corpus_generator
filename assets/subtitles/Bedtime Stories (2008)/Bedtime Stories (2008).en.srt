1
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,400
I'm going
to tell you a story now.

2
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,900
But as any good storyteller knows,

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,600
one must first be sure
the audience is prepared.

4
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,100
Is everybody comfortably seated?

5
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,400
Does anyone need to use the bathroom?

6
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,600
Oh. You, sir, in the back?

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,500
Well, hold it in.

8
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,500
You ready? Here we go.

9
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,300
My name is Marty Bronson.

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,400
I owned and operated
the Sunny Vista Motel,

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,100
which I established on the corner
of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,300
in Los Angeles, California,
in the year 1974.

13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,900
The motel was my labor of love,

14
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,800
and I ran it with the help
Wendy...

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,000
Wendy, the key, please,
for Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Thank you.

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,600
And Skeeter.

18
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,100
May I help you with your bags,
Mr. and Mrs. Dixon?

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,700
- Yes, please.
- Why, thank you, young man.

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,600
You, uh, need a hand?

21
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,400
No, no. I got it.

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,800
OK.

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,400
To my boy Skeeter,
the motel was a wonderland.

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,100
Way too hyper.

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,800
The galaxy's not big enough
for the both of us.

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,300
A magical place.

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,900
Full of new adventures
for a six-year-old boy.

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,500
Oh, Skeeter. Come here.

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,000
Skeeter loved the old place
as much as I did.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,500
And he always tried to come up
with ways to make it even better.

31
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,800
I've got a lot of ideas how
to improve things around here.

32
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,700
I was thinking we could put
an extra pair of socks in each room

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,500
because people always forget to pack
enough socks when they go on a trip.

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,000
That's a good idea.

35
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,500
Time for bed,
I'm meeting with Mr. Nottingham.

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,200
Wait, Dad. I'm not even tired.

37
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,600
Well, how about a bedtime story?

38
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,000
Yay!

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,700
Now, once upon a time,
there was a little boy,

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,400
and that little boy's name
was Skeeter.

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,200
Well, I could tell a pretty fair tale
when the muse was with me.

42
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,600
And making my little boy smile,

43
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,100
now, that was truly magical.

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,100
Yeah, I was a pretty good dad
and a pretty good host.

45
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,500
But unfortunately,
a pretty bad businessman.

46
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,500
Can't you read the writing
on the wall, Bronson?

47
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,100
This motel is sinking in red ink...

48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,400
and I'm offering you the last lifeboat.

49
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't know.

50
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,200
I've seen the books, Martin.

51
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,500
If you don't sell to me,
you're going to go bankrupt.

52
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,300
Yes, well, I...

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,600
I'd always hoped this place
would be a home for my children.

54
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,300
How about this?

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,700
If your boy works hard and shows
some smarts when he grows up,

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
I'll let him run this place.

57
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,500
You promise?

58
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,800
Yes. Now sign the bloody papers.

59
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
That's my boy, Bronson.

60
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,200
Trust me, I'm going to turn this place
into the finest hotel in Los Angeles.

61
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,200
It's going to be uptight
and out of sight.

62
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,100
And just like that,
our modest little Sunny Vista Motel...

63
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,900
... metamorphosized into the
mighty Sunny Vista Nottingham.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,400
And for the past 25 years,

65
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,900
it has been lovingly maintained
by my now grown-up son,

66
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,800
Skeeter Bronson, the handyman.

67
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,200
Yes, though Mr. Nottingham's promise
for Skeeter to run the place

68
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,700
- seems to have been forgotten...
- Hiya, Pop.

69
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,400
... my boy always works diligently
with a hopeful heart,

70
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,400
still waiting for his shot.

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,300
Mrs. Dixon?
Is there a problem with her room?

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,100
Nothing you should bother
your tiny mind about.

73
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,700
Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip
bottles of liquor out of her mini-bar,

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,100
and doesn't want to pay for it.

75
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I never even touched
that evil little refrigerator.

76
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,200
I don't drink alcohol.

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Of course.
There's probably a mix-up.

78
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,600
- I saw who took it.
- OK.

79
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,800
He had red hair and a beard.

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,400
He was wearing a green suit
with brass buttons.

81
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,900
And he stands about ten inches tall.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,600
So we're talking about a leprechaun?

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,700
There you go.

84
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,200
Oh, I didn't know your brother
was in town.

85
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,500
So, um, here's what
I think we should do.

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,000
Put all the missing bottles
on my tab.

87
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,800
Next time you see any leprechauns,
we'll tell Aspen.

88
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,900
She's half-troll.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,500
I think, trolls eat
leprechauns, am I right?

90
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,500
She would.

91
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,700
Today magic is
in the air at the grand hotel,

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,300
and the winds of change
are about to blow our story

93
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,700
in a strange new direction.

94
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
But what would you expect in a hotel

95
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,700
founded by someone who loved
a good story as much as I?

96
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,100
Time is of the essence here, Skeeter.

97
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,900
Oh, yeah, I know. I just don't want
the big boss man to get electrocuted.

98
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,300
Of course.

99
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,300
- You fixed it?
- Let me see here.

100
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,700
Yo, yo. Yo, yo.

101
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Check, check. One, two. Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Hear me in the back?

102
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
- Whoa, whoa.
- Skeeter.

103
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,600
I say "Barry,"
you say "Nottingham."

104
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,400
- Barry.
- Nottingham.

105
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
- Barry.
- Nottingham.

106
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,200
# Barry had a Nottingham

107
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,600
# Nottingham, Nottingham

108
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,400
# Barry had a Nottingham

109
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,100
# Whose beard was
white as snow #

110
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,000
Come on,
give it up for the big man.

111
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,000
Got them warmed up for you, sir.

112
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,500
- It's good to see you again.
- Germs.

113
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,600
- Germs?
- Uh, Skeeter,

114
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,800
Mr. Nottingham has
developed a fear, uh...

115
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,200
Not a fear, an awareness...

116
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,900
...of germs and
how dangerous they can be

117
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,300
when not properly... feared, so...

118
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,700
You're doing the right thing.
I didn't shower today.

119
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,600
So, yeah, let me get out of here.

120
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,300
Barry Nottingham, everybody.

121
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,900
- He's brilliant, him. I love this guy.
- Welcome.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
As you know, I own 23 hotels
from Berlin to Beijing.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,100
But it's no secret that this one,

124
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,400
the Sunny Vista Nottingham,
is my favorite.

125
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,400
However, this is a 20th-century hotel.

126
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,600
We need something for the 21 st century.

127
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,100
And so, we have decided
to close this hotel

128
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,200
and to build a brand-new
Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,400
This will be the largest hotel
on the West Coast.

130
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,000
I simply don't understand what the fuss
is about. It's just a big building.

131
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,900
Oh, no, no. This is like the
future of the hotel business.

132
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,600
...and a top-secret theme
that will blow your mind.

133
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,200
Yes!

134
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,200
So I'm proud to announce
the new hotel's general manager.

135
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,300
He's been waiting on this
for a long time.

136
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,500
We all know how hard he works,
how intelligent he is,

137
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,000
how much this hotel means to him.

138
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,200
Take a bow, Mr. Kendall Duncan!

139
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,500
Take a bow, Kendall.

140
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,800
- God bless.
- Boo!

141
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,100
A beautiful speech, sir.
A beautiful speech.

142
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
I'm so glad you could come.

143
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,000
It's great to see you.

144
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,500
Don't touch me.

145
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,900
Well done, Daddy.

146
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,200
Oh, oh, hello there.
Do you know my daughter, Violet?

147
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,200
Only by reputation, sir.

148
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,000
Excuse me?

149
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,900
No, no, not that she has a reputation.

150
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,400
I always heard she's very hot.

151
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,000
Not hot as in hot.

152
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
Hot, I meant warm...
Warm-hearted.

153
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,000
And she likes to go out
and have fun, festive times,

154
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,300
in bars, with a lot
of different guys, and...

155
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,400
That's the old Violet Nottingham.
Before she met me.

156
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,200
Now it's up to me to keep
my pooky-bear out of the spotlight

157
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,800
and nightclubs and tabloids.
Isn't that right, sir?

158
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,800
Violet's off to her private tennis
lesson with Roger Federer.

159
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,600
- Oh. All right, good for you.
- Bye, boys.

160
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,300
Got to say, uh...

161
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,900
...it's gonna be hard for me to see
the hotel move locations like this.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,500
Well, I, I do hope you'll feel able
to come and work with us there.

163
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,600
Big as Kendall wants to make it,

164
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,400
well, there's going to be a lot
of light bulbs to change.

165
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,900
Someone touched me.
Is there any sanitizer?

166
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,400
There is, sir. Come this way.
I'll get you some.

167
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,300
Can't be too careful, Kendall.

168
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,700
The Hokey Pokey]

169
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,100
All right, everyone finished
at the pottery table,

170
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,700
bring their art to the kiln.

171
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,400
The man with the rescue donkey's
leaving in five minutes,

172
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,200
if you haven't gotten a ride, hurry up.

173
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,500
Thank you, Principal Duva.

174
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,100
Oh, I'm not a principal
at this party. I'm a mom.

175
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,700
Hey!

176
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,000
I notice no one's eating
the gluten-free wheatgrass cake.

177
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,500
Come on. Trust me,
you just got to get past the smell.

178
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,800
What? The clown died?

179
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,600
- What's in that bag?
- Oh, chocolate chip cookie.

180
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,800
- Food!
- Food!

181
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,800
- Slow it down, slow it down.
- Hey, sissy.

182
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,900
Why do you bring sugary, chemical-filled
crud to my house every time you visit?

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What? Every time? You haven't
invited me here in four years.

184
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,500
What are you talking about?
It hasn't been four years.

185
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,700
You were here for
The Fourth of July barbecue

186
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,000
when you punched my husband?

187
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,900
Yes. That was four years ago.
I wanted to give him a wedgie,

188
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,700
but his underwear had holes in it.

189
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,500
I knew he'd be your ex-husband.
You should be happy.

190
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,000
All right. Let's not start.

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
How are the kids handling

192
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,100
the old divorce anyways?

193
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,300
They're both kind of off right now.
Bobbi's been really quiet.

194
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,800
Why don't you go say hi.
I'm gonna pay the donkey guy.

195
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,500
- Is that what stinks in here?
- No, it's the cake.

196
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,300
What did she make, donkey cake?

197
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,500
I smell manure.

198
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,300
Hey, you guys. Remember me?

199
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,700
Uncle Skeeter.

200
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,200
Man, you got big.
Haven't seen you in a while.

201
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,000
Happy birthday there, Bobbi.

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,500
I'm Patrick. She's Bobbi.

203
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,200
Oh, my bad.

204
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,400
Got you a little something.
Happy birthday, Bobbi.

205
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,000
Here you go.
Picked it up at the hotel.

206
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,200
How's school going?

207
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,600
- Skeeter?
- Yeah.

208
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,200
Getting called to the principal's
office. Look at that.

209
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,400
Have fun with the gifts. And...

210
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,800
Yes, yes.

211
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,200
Shampoo?

212
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,000
And a soap?

213
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,000
Hanger and a towel.

214
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Do not talk about school with them.

215
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,500
What's going on with the school?

216
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
- They're closing it down.
- No.

217
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,300
- I'm getting laid off.
- You?

218
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,800
You're like
the classic school principal.

219
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,500
I mean, you're, you're scary
and bad with people.

220
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Children are nervous around you.

221
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,700
That doesn't sound right, but,
I'm just saying, what else could you do?

222
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,600
Maybe, Cuban dictator? Or the bogeyman.
You could be the bogeyman.

223
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,300
- Anyway...
- What, what?

224
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
I've got some interviews
set up in Arizona,

225
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,000
which is kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

226
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,500
Uh-oh.

227
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,200
I need you to watch the kids...
for a week.

228
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,200
No! No, they don't even like me!

229
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,100
It's not going to be difficult, Skeeter.

230
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,100
My friend Jill
is a teacher at my school.

231
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,400
She'll bring the kids in with her
and watch them till dinnertime.

232
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,100
All you gotta do is the night shift.

233
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,800
Why can't your stupid friend do that?

234
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,600
She's got night school. Skeeter!

235
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,200
My husband left me.
I'm getting laid off.

236
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,300
I, I have to move.
I need your help.

237
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,000
So you need me.
This is good.

238
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,400
I'll do it.

239
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,100
But you got to say,

240
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
"Skeeter is the coolest.
I am a nerd."

241
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,100
"Skeeter's the coolest.
I'm a nerd?"

242
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,300
Yeah, you are! Whoo!

243
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,700
OK. Hey, you guys.

244
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm going to hang out with you
this week. All right?

245
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,900
Maybe we can go... fishing.

246
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,800
I'd rather you didn't.
Patrick's not a strong swimmer.

247
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,200
OK, we'll stay inside.

248
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
How about, uh,
we play some poker?

249
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,600
- I can teach you that.
- Gambling? I don't think so.

250
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,200
OK, how about we
just take walks in the park

251
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,300
- and catalog plant species?
- Now you're talking.

252
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,100
I don't know anything about plants

253
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,100
except you try to make cakes
out of them!

254
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,300
He liked that one.
I'm gonna end with a laugh.

255
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,500
Give me some. Huh?

256
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,500
I wasn't gonna hit you.
I was trying to do the fist thing.

257
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,300
You don't know the fist thing?

258
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,800
OK, I was just...

259
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,300
That's what, uh, the children do.

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,400
Hey, yeh, yeh.

261
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,200
Oh, this your truck, chief?

262
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,900
Yes, it is, ma'am.

263
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,500
You realize you're taking up
two parking spaces?

264
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,300
It's a big truck, ma'am.

265
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,100
It's not that big, sir.
You could fit into one spot.

266
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
I had to park
all the way down the block.

267
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,100
Well, next time park in that box.
Plenty of room in there.

268
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,200
Anyway, here's the situation.
This is not really my truck,

269
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,400
this is the hotel I work for's truck.

270
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,500
So if I get a scratch on it,
they take it out of my salary.

271
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,500
So two parking spaces
provides me with what I call

272
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,000
"a cushion of protection."

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Wait, a hotel? Oh, wait.
You're Wendy's brother.

274
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,100
- Yeah.
- I'm Jill.

275
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,500
- Who's that?
- I'm her friend,

276
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,400
the one helping take care of the kids.
I'm the day shift.

277
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,200
OK, June. You plan on being
this hostile the whole time?

278
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
Jill. My name is Jill.

279
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,700
Do you plan on keeping that
haircut the rest of the time?

280
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,500
Oh, haven't you heard?
Goofy's the new handsome.

281
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,700
- That sounds good for the environment.
- Oh, we can't all have Priuses.

282
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,200
How do you know I drive a Prius?

283
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,200
Your whole aura reads Prius.

284
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,400
Anyways, you're in my
cushion of protection right now.

285
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I want to back up, so if you
could just zing-zang up there,

286
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,400
- that would be helpful.
- Yeah.

287
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,700
You might want some Cinnabons.
You'll need it.

288
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,900
Food!

289
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,200
Give it back!
Somebody owes me six bucks!

290
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,000
So why didn't you demand that he make
you the big boss of the new hotel?

291
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,400
He promised your dad.

292
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,800
I wanted to.
It just wasn't the right time.

293
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,200
Let me tell you how it works.

294
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,100
The big man's giving the job
to Kendall

295
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,700
because he's dating his daughter.

296
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,900
That's the way it works,
keep it in the family.

297
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,800
He gets the girl, he gets the job,
he gets everything.

298
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,100
And I get nothing.

299
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,600
- Hello?
- Where are you? Still there?

300
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,300
I'm still where?
Who's this?

301
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Look, I've got to get to class.
The kids are waiting for you, OK?

302
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,600
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry.

303
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,400
I forgot.
I'll be there in like 20 minutes.

304
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,700
I'm gonna baby-sit
my nephew and niece tonight.

305
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,400
Oh, God.
Got any advice for me?

306
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,100
Yes, I do. Sometimes I baby-sit
my cousins, right?

307
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,400
And what I do is
I let them style me hair.

308
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,700
Like put beads into it and braid it,
make me look all real sexy.

309
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,000
Like Milli Vanilli, stuff like that.
You should try that.

310
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,900
Braid my hair? That's a good idea.
Can I have some French fries?

311
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,600
Of course you can.
You're my best friend.

312
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,000
Ah! Actually, I really like
ketchup on my face

313
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,000
because it's
rejuvenating for the skin.

314
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,600
So who's the real victim?
You are.

315
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,300
Mmm! Delicious.

316
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,300
Do you think these signs will help?

317
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,800
Well, miracles happen,
you know?

318
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,000
You mean like Dad coming back?

319
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,400
Um...

320
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,500
Hey!
Sorry I'm late.

321
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,500
So, um, their pajamas
are on their beds,

322
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,100
and I will be back, um,
at 8:30 to pick them up, OK?

323
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,000
- All right.
- Here is my cell phone number.

324
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,600
And call me if there's
any emergencies.

325
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,400
All right. Have fun at night school.

326
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

327
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,800
All packed up here.

328
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,200
I got my, uh, toothbrush
and, uh, and the toothpaste.

329
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,700
Some clean underwear.

330
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,900
Well, maybe not that clean.

331
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,400
You guys want to watch TV?

332
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,300
We don't have a TV.

333
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,700
- Hello?
- Emergency!

334
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,900
They don't have a TV.

335
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,400
Wendy doesn't let them watch TV.
You didn't know?

336
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
I don't know a lot of things
about these kids.

337
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,300
I wasn't allowed over here.
Their old man didn't like me.

338
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,400
OK, listen, you don't need a TV.
You can, um, play a game, do a puzzle.

339
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,800
I'm sure you can figure
something out. OK?

340
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Should I let them
braid my hair or something?

341
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,300
Would they like that?

342
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,700
I don't think anyone
should touch that hair.

343
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,900
Hey, what do you say we go...

344
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,400
next door and toilet paper
your neighbor's trees?

345
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,400
No? OK, bedtime!

346
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,100
OK, so you guys cool?

347
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,700
You have to read us a bedtime story.

348
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,200
Yeah, all right. You have any?

349
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,000
Whoo! What do you got here, anyways?

350
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,100
"Rainbow Alligator Saves the Wetlands"?

351
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,300
Mmm, no.

352
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,800
"The Organic Squirrel
Gets a Bike Helmet"?

353
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,400
I'm not reading these
communist books to you guys.

354
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't you got any real stories?

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,300
- Like what?
- Like what?

356
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,800
Like, like cowboys? Or dragons?

357
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,100
Or aliens? Or... What the heck
is on my head right now?

358
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,300
That's Bugsy, our guinea pig.

359
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,400
- Why do you call him Bugsy?
- Because of his eyes.

360
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,200
Let me see them.

361
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,000
Wow! Those eyes would be big on a cow.

362
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,300
Are those eyeballs
or bowling balls?

363
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Can't keep my eyes off of them.

364
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,000
Just get in there so I don't have to
look at them anymore. Goodbye.

365
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,700
Anyways, uh,

366
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,600
you guys want me to, uh,
make up a story for you?

367
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Like, like my old man used to do for me?

368
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,200
Maybe I could be good at this.

369
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,700
All right, um...

370
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,900
Here goes.

371
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,500
Once upon a time,
in a magical, faraway kingdom...

372
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,200
Once upon a time,
in a magical, faraway kingdom...

373
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,000
... there was a brave
and noble knight.

374
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,000
Strikingly handsome.

375
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,900
Who lived in a grand castle

376
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:19,500
that weary travelers from near and far
would come and visit.

377
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Now, this knight had been
working his butt off for years.

378
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,400
You'd think he'd be a shoo-in
to rule the castle, right?

379
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,600
- Right.
- Wrong.

380
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,600
Actually, he wasn't
even a knight at all.

381
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,900
Oh, no.

382
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,300
He was, in fact,
just a lowly peasant.

383
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,600
And even though he was the son
of the late, great Lord Marty...

384
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,300
Thank you.

385
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,500
... and knew everything there is
to know about running a castle,

386
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
everyone just took him for granted.

387
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,600
His name was Mr. Underappreciated.

388
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,600
What's "underdemeciated"?

389
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,400
- Under de-what?
- Underdemeciated.

390
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,800
That's right,
I forgot you were six.

391
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,100
His name was Sir... Fix-A-Lot.

392
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,200
But alas, the kingdom
where Sir Fix-A-Lot lived

393
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,400
did not place much value on dedication
or hard work, I guess.

394
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,000
Because the superstar in all
the land was Sir Butt-Kiss.

395
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,900
And he spent all his days
kissing everybody's butt.

396
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,600
Boo!

397
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,200
And my lord, yes,
of course I can get you

398
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,500
front row house seats
to The Lion King.

399
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,400
And Sir Fix-A-Lot had
a best friend, Friar Fred,

400
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,400
who was not right in the head.

401
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,800
She never! No! Not our queen,
I won't have that.

402
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,600
- Were there any kids in the kingdom?
- Yes, yes. Of course.

403
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,700
There were two young pages.

404
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,300
Mistress Stinky
and Master Smelly.

405
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,200
Hey-oh! And don't forget...

406
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,700
Jillian! The queen of the fairies!

407
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,500
Queen of the fairies?

408
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,900
I mean, if she has to be there,
let's just make her an angry raven.

409
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
Parking spot!

410
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,000
She should be
a mermaid teacher.

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,600
Yeah. The best
mermaid teacher in the world.

412
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,300
Children, open your books to page 16.

413
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,800
Yes, Miss Mermaid.

414
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,100
Let's begin.

415
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,500
All right, she's a mermaid.
Whatever you want.

416
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,000
Anyways, back to the story.

417
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,200
One day the king invited
all his subjects to the castle.

418
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,100
I bring glad tidings.

419
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,800
For on this day
I have chosen a champion

420
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,900
who will run this castle

421
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,400
and be my closest advisor
and bestest buddy.

422
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,200
My new champion is...

423
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,600
...Sir Butt-Kiss!

424
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,200
Thank you.

425
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,600
Poor Sir Fix-A-Lot had been passed over.

426
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,900
So, Sir Fix-A-Lot
moved into a giant shoe,

427
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,500
got a bad case of athlete's face,

428
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,800
dove into a moat...

429
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,800
Ah, what the heck.

430
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,600
... and got eaten by crocodiles.

431
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,000
The end.

432
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,300
The end? That can't be the end.

433
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,700
- Why? Why not?
- It's not happy.

434
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,300
There aren't happy endings in real life.
Sooner you know that, the better.

435
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,100
- It's not fair!
- What? What's not fair?

436
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,200
I mean, shouldn't Sir Fix-A-Lot
at least get a shot to be champion?

437
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,700
- A shot? Hmm...
- If Sir Fix-A-Lot is better

438
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,700
than Sir Butt-Kiss, he should
get a chance to prove it.

439
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,200
OK. Yeah, yeah,
Bobbi, good.

440
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,100
What the king
really said was...

441
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,600
On second thought,

442
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,700
there is another worthy man
in my kingdom,

443
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,300
and it wouldn't be fair
unless he got a shot, too.

444
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,300
Sir Fix-A-Lot!

445
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,400
And then the crowd went nuts.

446
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,700
Don't Stop Believin']

447
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,300
But, Sire, Fix-A-Lot
is as common as muck.

448
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,600
Boo!

449
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,600
And Friar Fred
drop-kicked a booing goblin.

450
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,500
Boo!

451
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,700
And the mermaid teacher did one of those
weird tail dolphin moves.

452
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,000
And Stinky and Smelly
did the fastest Irish jig ever.

453
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,100
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

454
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,800
Yeah. Right on.

455
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,200
Prince Bugsy busted out
some fancy moves.

456
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,200
And then... and then...

457
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
It started raining gumballs.

458
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,500
Raining gumballs?

459
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,700
Why not? It's a bedtime story.
Anything can happen.

460
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,800
Yeah, yeah.
I guess in a story.

461
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,100
I just wish it was like that
in real life. I really do.

462
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
- What was that?
- Bugsy.

463
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Oh.

464
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,300
He rings that bell when he's hungry?

465
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,700
No, when he needs to go to sleep.

466
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,900
OK. As you wish,
Your Highness.

467
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,800
All right, you guys, have a good sleep.
You, too, uh, weird eyes.

468
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,200
Well, I don't
have much to work with,

469
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,400
but I will make us

470
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,700
a delicious breakfast

471
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,300
that I know you will enjoy.

472
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Yes, some banana
on the rice cake,

473
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,100
and then what do we call this?
Wheat germ.

474
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,800
I was told germs are bad for you,
but here goes.

475
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,100
I like it.

476
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,700
A rice cake-banana-wheat germ sandwich.

477
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,300
And what do we got?

478
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,600
This is terrible.

479
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,100
Doesn't your, your mother
have taste buds?

480
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,900
What are we doing here?
We got nothing to use in this house.

481
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,500
Hang on.

482
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,000
A little flavor.

483
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,000
It's good because, now we don't
have to brush our teeth.

484
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,700
There you go. At least we got
a little mint going on. Guys want one?

485
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Hang on.

486
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,200
Hello!

487
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,900
Bronson? The television set
in Mr. Nottingham's room

488
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,100
is broken and it needs
to be fixed right away.

489
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I have a situation here.
I'm watching my nephew and my niece.

490
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,800
I'm sorry. Are you having
difficulty hearing me?

491
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,400
Mr. Nottingham wants
to watch television now!

492
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,900
I hear you.
I speak trollinese, don't worry.

493
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,900
There's a leprechaun behind you.

494
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,700
Gotcha.

495
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,100
Thanks a lot, gentlemen. OK.

496
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,500
- Wow.
- It's pretty, huh?

497
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Whoa!

498
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,600
I got to go fix my boss' television set,
but I need somebody to watch you two.

499
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,400
Violet!
Right here. Give a smile.

500
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,900
Hang on.

501
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,600
Violet! Skeeter Bronson,
the handyman from the other day.

502
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,400
Oh, right. Yes.

503
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,800
Listen, uh, I got some kids
with me right now.

504
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,300
My nephew and niece. But,
I gotta fix your father's TV.

505
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,100
Could you watch them a few minutes?

506
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,500
Huh?

507
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,300
Yeah, yeah. All right, I'm going.

508
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
Come in.

509
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,600
- Mr. Nottingham, sir?
- Uh, the telly won't turn on.

510
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,300
It won't? Well, let me just
take a... tallyho at it, OK?

511
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,100
I'll just flip this light on.

512
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,800
No, no, no, no!
Absolutely not!

513
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,300
I'm fighting a cold here.

514
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,700
I must stay in the dark
whenever possible.

515
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,300
Do you realize

516
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,300
germs can reproduce
80 percent faster in bright light?

517
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,200
Oh, OK. Here we go,
nice and dark again.

518
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,600
- The germs are confused.
- Come towards me.

519
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,500
OK. It's got to be
around here somewhere.

520
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,300
For heaven's sake.

521
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,800
I'm so sorry, sir.
I just can't see a thing.

522
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,100
- To your left, there.
- Oh!

523
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,700
There's the TV. So how's the,
uh, new hotel coming, sir?

524
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Oh, very well. Still dealing with the
city on building permits and whatnot.

525
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,300
Uh-huh.

526
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,100
I can't tell you the secret theme.

527
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,600
It's so good, we don't want
anyone to steal it.

528
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,600
- I hear you, sir.
- OK, I'll tell you.

529
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,700
Come along, sit down. Please.

530
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,100
Great.

531
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,700
Ready?

532
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,600
Rock and roll.

533
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Vintage vinyl.
Music memorabilia in the lobby.

534
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,000
Oh, OK. Like, uh, like the Hard Rock?

535
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,800
- The What What?
- The Hard Rock Hotel.

536
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,900
They've been using
that theme for, like, years.

537
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,900
Get Kendall Duncan
up here straightaway, please.

538
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,200
What a perfect
little powder puff.

539
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Thank you.

540
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,800
So, Patrick, truth or dare?

541
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,100
Truth?

542
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,300
How old were you the first time
you kissed a girl?

543
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,400
Patrick never kissed a girl.

544
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,400
Girls are bis-crusting.

545
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,200
Except for Trisha Sparks.

546
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,100
Ooh, is that a girl in your class,
you little Romeo?

547
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,300
Hey, guys.

548
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,700
Hi, Aunt Jill, did you
get the note we left you?

549
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,600
Yes, I did.

550
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,600
And, uh, now we have to get you guys
ready for school. So, come on.

551
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

552
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Oh, hey. You're, uh...

553
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,300
- Uh-huh. Here's your fat mouse.
- It's a guinea pig, but...

554
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,500
And you, young man...

555
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,300
I want to hear all about this little
Trisha Sparks next time I see you.

556
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,700
Trisha Sparks is
two years older than you.

557
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,200
She's hot.

558
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,300
I'm very disappointed in you, Kendall.
We almost made an apocalyptic mistake.

559
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,700
This rock and roll idea
of yours is old hat.

560
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,300
Well, sir, I had every intention
of putting our own spin on it.

561
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,700
Do you know what, Skeeter?

562
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,400
I'm starting to get a fuzzy recollection

563
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,600
of something I said to your father.

564
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,500
In fact, I am going to give you a shot.

565
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,800
If you can come up with a better theme
than Kendall does,

566
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,000
I'll let you run the new place instead.

567
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,400
Oh, sir.

568
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,400
Don't you think this is perhaps
a little too much of a cruel joke

569
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,600
to be playing on somebody as...
well, the, the maintenance guy?

570
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,900
- No, I don't.
- No.

571
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,800
Mr. Bronson has been working
for this company for 25 years.

572
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,300
I'm beginning to think I may have
seriously underdemeciated him.

573
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,700
I'm sorry.
"Underdemeciated"?

574
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:59,100
Precisely. You can both present your
ideas at my birthday party this weekend.

575
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,700
Thank you, Kendall.
That is all.

576
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,200
Mr. Bronson, the television,
if you would.

577
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,200
Oh, and do watch out
for the germ vaporizer.

578
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:08,900
Rock Me Amadeus]

579
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,000
Rock Me Amadeus]

580
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,300
The best day of my life!

581
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,600
# Amadeus Amadeus

582
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,700
# Amadeus Ow! Amadeus
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

583
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,700
# Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus

584
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,200
# Ooh, rock me Amadeus

585
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,000
# Amadeus Amadeus

586
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,100
Whoa. I like your car, pal.

587
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,100
Hey, thanks, champ.
You know what they say.

588
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,500
You want to be the best,
you got to drive the best.

589
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,300
Hey, uh, not to get personal,

590
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,000
but what's a sweet ride
like that cost, anyways?

591
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,800
You know what? Actually it's
surprisingly affordable.

592
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Yeah?

593
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,100
If you saved every paycheck you
earn for the rest of your life

594
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,500
and then multiply it by ten, you
could probably buy my muffler.

595
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,700
Ah-ooga!

596
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,100
Oh, you wanna drag race, do you?

597
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,600
You win! Good job.

598
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,900
What?

599
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,700
This is spooky.

600
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,200
You've got to be kidding me!
Look at this. I'm losing all my candy.

601
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,200
How can you not see
a 50-foot trailer? Come on.

602
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,200
So you have to compete for your job with
Skeeter Bronson. You'll annihilate him.

603
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,200
Oh, I know. It's just
a little degrading, that's all.

604
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,300
Thanks for being there.

605
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,700
I'll be there as long as
there's a there to be at.

606
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,600
Oh, hello, children.

607
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,800
We're looking for Skeeter Bronson.

608
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh, Mr. Bronson.

609
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,300
Yes, you'll find him in room 109.

610
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,500
- OK.
- Please, this way.

611
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,300
- Oh, my God! Did you see that thing?
- Those eyes.

612
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,300
They were, they were staring
into my, my very soul.

613
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,800
- Hey, Uncle Skeeter!
- Hey!

614
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,300
- Just who I wanted to see.
- Hey, chief, here's Bugsy.

615
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,000
- Got him.
- Why do they have to stay here?

616
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
Because I'm on call tonight,
Jennifer.

617
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,400
It's Jill, actually, Scooter.

618
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,800
It is? OK, yeah...

619
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,700
You did not just do that.

620
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,500
I did. Watch.
I'm gonna do it again.

621
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,400
So, guys, anything weird
happen to you today?

622
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,700
I had a substitute teacher
with an eye patch.

623
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Uh... that's a little weird.
I'm talking like big-time weird.

624
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,300
Maybe coincidence weird, uh...

625
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,300
...as in gumball weird?

626
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,200
We're not allowed to chew gum.

627
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,600
Of course you're not.
You guys want to go to sleep?

628
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,200
It's only 5:30.

629
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,700
And we haven't had dinner.

630
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,700
Hmm. OK.

631
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,100
Room service!

632
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,000
So you've never
been skateboarding?

633
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,600
You've never played video games?

634
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,900
Mom says they rot your brain.

635
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,300
That's not true. I've been playing video
games my whole life, and look at me.

636
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,100
Yeah, maybe she's got a point.

637
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,800
You. You've never eaten bacon?

638
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,700
What's bacon?

639
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Bacon is the juicy,
fatty part of the pig

640
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,000
right adjacent to the rear.

641
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:22,000
But delicious and tasty,
not how I just made it sound.

642
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,700
And this is the first hamburger
you've ever eaten?

643
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,000
- What's the verdict? What do you think?
- Life-changing.

644
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,400
- Mom's gonna kill us.
- No, she isn't.

645
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,000
First of all, she's never
gonna find out about this.

646
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,200
And second of all, she used to eat
plenty of hamburgers

647
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,400
when we were growing up
in this very room.

648
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,800
She did?

649
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,000
Looks like Bugsy's eaten a lot
of burgers in the last ten minutes.

650
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Wow!

651
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,900
He keeps going like that,
we could make bacon out of Bugsy.

652
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,800
He's kidding, Bugsy.
Take it easy.

653
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,100
OK. Let's get you carnivores to bed.

654
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
I got a, a new story
I want to lay on you.

655
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,100
What do you think
of cowboys and Indians?

656
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,900
Oh, yes, tonight's the night!

657
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,700
I just like cowboys and Indians
'cause of the conflict.

658
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:07,800
OK, once upon a time in the Old West,

659
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,200
OK, once upon a time in the Old West,

660
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,800
before room service was
even invented...

661
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,300
... there was a farm hand
named Jeremiah Skeets.

662
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,500
He was looking to get
ahead in the world,

663
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,800
but was having a problem

664
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,000
with his current mode
of transportation.

665
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,700
Uh, that was my horse.
That wasn't me, everybody.

666
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,400
Someone once told Jeremiah

667
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,700
that if he wanted to be the best,

668
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,200
he'd have to ride the best.

669
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,300
You mind showing me your finest horse?

670
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,700
My ancestors believe horse spirit

671
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,100
come down from mountain
during time of fire, wind.

672
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,800
Many brave warrior
walk trail of moon bear...

673
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,700
OK. Look, I just want to see your finest
horse, not a whole thing there.

674
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,100
- Sorry. I can do it.
- All right.

675
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,000
Screaming Rooster, bring out Ferrari.

676
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,600
Ferrari.

677
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,300
Oh, my.

678
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,100
Oh, my, oh, my!

679
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,400
Look at that.

680
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,600
Whoa!

681
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,300
I would get automatic respect
riding such a beautiful animal,

682
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,500
but I'm afraid that's just
a bit out of my price range.

683
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,700
Tell you what, white bread.

684
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,400
I'll give you Ferrari...

685
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,000
...for free!

686
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,700
Boo-yah!
The end. I love it.

687
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,600
Brilliant story.
So he got the Ferrari for free.

688
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,200
I love that. I love that.

689
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,600
A guy getting a free horse?
That's not a good story.

690
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,700
Where's the arc? There's no arc.
I've not learned anything.

691
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,200
Also, you've got
a moral obligation to them.

692
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
What are they gonna
walk away from that with?

693
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,500
I didn't know we were doing
an After School Special.

694
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,100
Why can't he do something
a real gentleman would do,

695
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,100
like save a damsel in distress?

696
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,800
Not a bad idea, munchkin.

697
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,500
OK. So, uh...
let's continue.

698
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,100
Jeremiah was
out for a ride when...

699
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,400
Oh, please, don't!

700
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,300
- Give us that jewelry.
- You want my pearls? Help! Please!

701
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,100
Yah! Yah! Yah! Whoo!

702
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,700
Oh, my necklace? Here, take it.

703
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
Come on, boy!

704
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,600
Here.

705
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,800
What else you got, sweetie?

706
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,100
Help! Help!

707
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,400
Leave the lady alone!

708
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,000
Care for a lift, ma'am?

709
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,800
- Yeah.
- Oh!

710
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,300
- Nice horse.
- Oh, what, this old thing?

711
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,400
Now, any of you gentlemen want to give
the nice lady her stuff back?

712
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,100
Not a chance, huh?

713
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,700
Because I beg to differ!

714
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,000
- My hero.
- I like that.

715
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,900
So Jeremiah spirited
Miss Davenport away to safety,

716
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,200
when she says...

717
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,600
Shall we go drink champagne
in a nearby hot tub?

718
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,900
- Hot tub?
- Mmm.

719
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,900
Uh, yeah. No.

720
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,600
I was saying that because I wanted to
see if you two were paying attention.

721
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,000
What happened was Jeremiah
dropped Miss Davenport off

722
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
in the nearest town, safe and sound.

723
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,200
How ever can I thank you, sir?

724
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,500
Ah, no thanks necessary, ma'am.

725
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,500
But I do insist on expressing
my gratitude in some manner.

726
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,700
Fair enough. I'll take...

727
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,100
...$100 million.

728
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,800
The end. Let's hope it works.

729
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,200
Very well written,
brilliantly constructed.

730
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,500
Jeremiah wouldn't take money
for doing a good deed.

731
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,400
Uh... I know Jeremiah
a lot better than you guys.

732
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,900
And believe me, he'd be all over that.
He loves money.

733
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,300
Mmm!

734
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,800
I don't want that.
Go back, rewrite. Rewrite.

735
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,700
Gentlemen don't get paid.

736
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,200
Will you just...
Who's telling the story here?

737
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,400
It should really end more like this.

738
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Well, I must give you
some token of my appreciation.

739
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,600
Oh, no.

740
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,800
Perhaps... a kiss?

741
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,900
Touchdown.

742
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,700
Then an angry dwarf kicks him.

743
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,300
Ow!

744
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,200
What the heck did you do that for?

745
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,300
Because I'm angry.

746
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,200
Go! Let's go!

747
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,500
All right! Yeah!

748
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,300
I didn't do nothing to you!

749
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,500
- The end.
- You know what?

750
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,900
Laugh as much as you want.
I'll take a Ferrari

751
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
and a kiss any day of the week.

752
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,800
I'd just like to kiss a Ferrari.

753
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,300
- All right. Good night.
- Good night, Uncle Skeeter.

754
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,900
Good night, home slice.

755
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,600
Thanks for the stories.

756
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,600
You came up with
all the good parts, Bobbi.

757
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,500
Good night, y'all.

758
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,200
You too there, Bugsy.

759
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,700
And them braids look fantastic.
They've taken years off you.

760
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,200
You mind sleeping over?
I'm gonna duck out a few hours.

761
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Mmm. By the way, um,

762
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,200
I am, uh, legally obliged to tell you

763
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,200
that I suffer from...
sleep panic disorder.

764
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,800
OK, what's, uh, sleep panic disorder?

765
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,400
Believe me, you don't want to know.

766
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,300
What am I thinking? Why would
anyone give me a free Ferrari?

767
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,700
I must be losing my mind.

768
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,100
Much power of the horse
underneath that hood.

769
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,200
Hello.

770
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,200
Are you the guy I'm supposed to see?

771
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,100
I'm here, aren't I?

772
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,200
So... am I about to get
a cherry red Ferrari?

773
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,400
I don't see why not.

774
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,100
For... free?

775
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,200
Sounds good to... me!

776
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,100
What do I do now?
Eat a gumball or something?

777
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Yes.

778
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,200
- Fell out of the sky, right?
- Yeah.

779
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,200
Shh!

780
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,300
Oh! Shh.

781
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,800
I won't tell nobody.

782
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,700
Now, close your eyes
and count to three.

783
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,600
- OK.
- Then it's all gonna happen.

784
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
- No.
- Yeah.

785
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,700
- One, two...
- Yeah.

786
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,900
...three.

787
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,300
Ferrari!

788
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,400
Hey! My wallet!

789
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,200
Not anymore!

790
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,100
Excuse me.
Hi, boys.

791
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,200
OK, thank you.

792
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Thanks, guys. Sorry.
I'm just trying to find my car.

793
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,300
All By Myself]

794
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,400
Good thing my wallet
only had three dollars in it.

795
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,000
And my Derek Jeter baseball card!

796
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,500
Guys, guys, stop, please.

797
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,000
You've had enough, now.
Thank you.

798
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,100
Stop!

799
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,700
Come on, man!

800
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,500
- Care for a lift, ma'am?
- Skeeter?

801
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
- Skeeter Bronson?
- Yes, ma'am.

802
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,600
What do you say you boys

803
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,200
give the pretty lady back
the pictures you took?

804
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,900
Sure about that, now?
Because I beg to differ.

805
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,800
Guy's got a gun!

806
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm just happy they
didn't make me use this thing.

807
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,300
- My hero.
- Really?

808
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,800
That was brilliant, Skeeter.

809
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,800
I don't know what happened.
Something came over me.

810
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,400
It felt good.
It felt really good.

811
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,300
How am I ever going to thank you?

812
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,200
Hmm.

813
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,800
No thanks is necessary, ma'am?

814
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,600
Oh, am I in the presence
of a gentleman?

815
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,900
At your service, ma'am.

816
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,400
Well, I must show
my appreciation in some form.

817
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,100
Ow!

818
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,800
Consider yourself
big people-bashed, sucker.

819
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,300
I knew you were gonna show up.

820
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,600
Get in the Gremlin, Jimmy,
before Sasquatch calls the cops.

821
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,300
Yeah, 'cause that's
how we do what we do. Right?

822
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,700
That's what you get, buddy.

823
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,500
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Let's go! Yeah!

824
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,900
Pull me in. Let's get
out of here. Pull me in!

825
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,600
Big people stink!

826
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,500
OK, well, you don't see that every day.

827
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:27,300
Indeed. And on that strange note,
I bid you good night.

828
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,100
Yes, yes.

829
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,000
Oh! Oh!

830
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,900
All right, so that's how I'm getting it.

831
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
- Getting what?
- This is just... I shouldn't.

832
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,700
I, I couldn't. You know what?
I can. I'm gonna take it.

833
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,700
What are you talking about?

834
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,200
I'm talking about a very generous girl

835
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,100
who wants to give her rescuer
a cherry red Ferrari...

836
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,200
...for free!

837
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,700
This is sick!

838
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,500
Well, uh, good luck with that.
I'm just going to go.

839
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,700
What do you mean?

840
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,700
Do you have another one at your house?

841
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,200
Am I, am I supposed
to follow you or something?

842
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,400
So seriously, no, no Ferrari?

843
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,400
Where's the $100 million, at least?!

844
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,500
Boo!

845
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,600
Hey, hey, hey!
Get your own campaign vehicle.

846
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,400
Yeah.

847
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,200
- Hi.
- Hey, Aunt Jill.

848
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,300
Hey, guys.
How did last night go?

849
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,800
An angry dwarf kicked me in the leg,
and I didn't get a free Ferrari.

850
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,900
So there you go.

851
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,100
Oh. How sad.

852
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,500
- He's talking about our bedtime story.
- Oh.

853
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,900
Uncle Skeeter said Jeremiah would get
a new horse and a kiss,

854
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,800
but I said the dwarf would kick him.

855
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,600
You said it.

856
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,600
Maybe that's how it works.

857
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,300
The kids control the stories.

858
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,800
And there are the wind chimes.
You know what that means.

859
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,100
What what means?

860
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,300
Huh?

861
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,600
Nothing.
Don't worry about it.

862
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,700
I won't.

863
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,900
OK, guys. Um, what is Bugsy doing?

864
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,800
Working off the hamburgers
he ate last night.

865
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,600
Yes, I gave Bugsy some hamburgers,

866
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,300
but I gave the children
that wheat germ stuff

867
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,000
because that's what they love.

868
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,400
I guess it's, uh, Bugsy
watching the TV then too?

869
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah, I flipped that on
and, look, he's glued to it.

870
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,400
I'm innocent!

871
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,300
What was that?

872
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,600
Uh... that was the sleep
panic disorder, I believe.

873
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,700
Why don't we, uh, get out of
here before the next attack.

874
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Give your uncle a kiss.

875
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,100
I'm a relative, I deserve it.
Right there.

876
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,900
Oh, that felt nice.

877
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,900
How about one more for the road?

878
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,600
- No.
- Come on, baby!

879
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,400
Don't worry, we'll be back tonight.

880
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,900
Yeah, no, I'm not worried.

881
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,300
You're coming back,
we got a big story tonight!

882
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,100
About some hotel theme ideas!
Yeah!

883
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,900
- Maybe we won't come back.
- What?

884
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,500
- Skeeter?
- Sir Butt-Kiss. Sir... Kendall.

885
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,300
I understand that you feel a need
to prepare for our little... showdown.

886
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,200
- Yeah.
- That does not excuse you

887
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,000
from maintenance responsibilities.

888
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,100
- Oh, no. Check.
- Lights are out in the spa.

889
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,600
- The south service elevator is slow.
- Check.

890
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,200
Let me try that cheesecake.

891
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,900
Oh, another thing.

892
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,200
I heard about your big hero act
with my girlfriend last night.

893
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,300
- This paparazzi was...
- I know what it is you're trying to do,

894
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,100
and it's not gonna work.

895
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,700
You have to find another way

896
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,600
to cozy up to the old man
because I'm here to tell you

897
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,900
Violet Nottingham is not gonna
date a gum-scraping handyman.

898
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,700
Hey, Kendall.

899
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,200
Two things. First off,
you got something right there.

900
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,400
Yeah, now, use your hands.
That's disturbing to see.

901
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,900
Good. Secondly, when I get
the job at the new hotel,

902
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,100
I was actually considering keeping
you on, so watch your tone with me.

903
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,100
Your brief little trip
to the land of make-believe

904
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,400
is just about over, my friend. OK?

905
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,800
We all know your failed father
ran this hotel into the ground,

906
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,500
and thankfully, you will not
get the chance to make

907
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,400
the same mistake all over again.

908
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,900
May want to pick that up.

909
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,100
- It's Duncan.
- Lover, hello.

910
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,600
I'm looking for the hotel site.

911
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,800
I gave you the address,
macho bunny.

912
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,600
The address you gave me is no good.
There's a school here.

913
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,600
- Oh, what school?
- Webster Elementary School.

914
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,400
- Oh, then you're in the right place.
- Is that so?

915
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,200
- This school is being shut down.
- Uh-huh.

916
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,200
The old man pulled a few strings
at the board of education.

917
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,800
- Really?
- We start demolition immediately.

918
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,000
That is very exciting news.

919
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,300
Oh, Pinky.

920
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,800
Hello!

921
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,800
Skeeter? Hey, it's Wendy.

922
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,100
- Hey, sissy.
- Hey. How's it going?

923
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,800
- Are the kids OK?
- Oh, yeah. We're having a blast.

924
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,300
That was impressive, Bobbi,

925
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,500
but Uncle Skeeter can jump
over the couch the long way.

926
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,900
- Skeeter, can I talk to them?
- No, I'm taking them camping.

927
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,700
- No.
- Have fun in Arizona. Bye!

928
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,700
Camping? No, Skeeter,
they could get poison ivy!

929
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,600
- Let's go. Quietly.
- Where are we going?

930
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,700
- Someplace special, fools.
- Whoo-hoo!

931
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,500
Now march, march,
march, march...

932
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,300
# I don't know
but it's been said

933
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,000
# Bugsy's eyes
pop out of his head

934
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,300
March, march, march...

935
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,500
- Whoo-hoo!
- March, let's go.

936
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,800
Whoa! Cool!

937
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,200
We're going to have ourselves
a camp-out.

938
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,300
You guys, look what he's done!
Isn't this cool?

939
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,800
- See? See how nice I am?
- Yeah.

940
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,900
Whoa, OK, just be careful
around the fire.

941
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,600
Hey, Jill. Shh.
Don't want everyone to hear we're here.

942
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,000
I heard about marshmallows.
Saw them in magazines.

943
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,000
I never imagined they
would be this good.

944
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,200
Let's just hope your mother
doesn't find out I gave you any.

945
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,900
- I won't tell her.
- I'm not talking about you.

946
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,300
She's the weak link.

947
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,800
I think I can let this one slide.

948
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,900
Ahh! The mermaid's being cool.
Look at that.

949
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,800
- The what?
- The nothing.

950
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,800
You know, when we were younger
and your mom and I were out on the roof,

951
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,200
my dad would always tell us
to look at the stars

952
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:40,400
and see if you could make something
out of them. All right, like, uh...

953
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,000
Right over there.
Right over there. Look, look.

954
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,800
To me, that looks like a camel.

955
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,900
You see the humps? Huh?
The tongue hanging out?

956
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,400
Oh, yeah. I see that.

957
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,500
Hey, look over there!
It's a pyramid.

958
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,900
Yeah!
Hey, good one, Patrick.

959
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,900
Look, right next to the moon.
Right, right beside it.

960
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,000
It looks exactly like Bugsy.

961
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,400
Oh, my God!

962
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,400
Don't worry, Bugsy.
Your eyes are still bigger.

963
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,500
Uncle Skeeter?

964
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,000
Yes, good-looking.

965
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,500
Do you think my father will come back?

966
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,400
Um...
Well, that's a tough one.

967
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,600
He must be going through some...
mental malfunction

968
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,500
to not want to be with you two guys
every second of the day.

969
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:38,200
But, uh, I do know this.

970
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,900
You're always going to have your mother.

971
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,200
You're always gonna have
this girl to hang out with.

972
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,700
And me, I ain't ever going anywhere.

973
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,500
OK?

974
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,500
I'm like the stink on your feet.
I'll always be around.

975
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,900
OK. You guys made me late.
I hope you're happy.

976
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,800
Well, thank you.
Have fun at night school.

977
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,000
See you tomorrow.

978
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,400
All right, we got rid of her,
so let's get to business.

979
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,300
Put the s'mores down.
Story time.

980
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:13,500
All right, guys. Tonight's story's
gonna be extra special.

981
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,300
All right, guys. Tonight's story's
gonna be extra special.

982
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,200
It's called...

983
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,100
... The Great Hotel Idea Story.

984
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,300
Yeah!

985
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,600
- What?
- Boring.

986
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,500
Come on, guys,
I really need you to do this.

987
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,400
It's gonna help
my life a lot. Please?

988
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,900
All right, you know what?

989
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,300
We still got one more night.
Let's have a fun story.

990
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,700
How about some Evel Knievel stuff?

991
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,200
Racing, jumping, flying...

992
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,700
Or maybe something like romantic?

993
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,200
I have a good idea.

994
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,400
Let's combine the action
and the romance

995
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,100
and make a romaction story.

996
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,400
- Yeah.
- Let us begin.

997
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,900
The greatest of all the heroes
in ancient Greece

998
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,400
was, of course, Skeetacus.

999
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,900
He was truly amazing

1000
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,900
yet totally underrated
and had been ignored for years.

1001
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,300
Finally Skeetacus had his chance
to show his skills in the grand arena.

1002
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,700
If he could impress the
daughter of the emperor,

1003
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,900
he knew he would one day rule the land.

1004
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,500
- Skeetacus, Skeetacus!
- Go on, Skeetacus!

1005
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,500
That's pretty fancy chariot work.

1006
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,000
For a peasant.

1007
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,900
# I see London, I see France

1008
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,300
# I see my golden underpants

1009
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,100
Whoo!

1010
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,600
Oh, wh... what is he doing?

1011
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,800
Whoa!

1012
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,100
Bring on the elephants!

1013
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,000
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

1014
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,900
All right.

1015
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,700
You know how Hercules

1016
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,700
supposedly founded the Olympics?

1017
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:22,500
Well, Skeetacus invented the X Games.

1018
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,100
He's never gonna make it!

1019
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,900
Now that's first class.

1020
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,500
Hey!

1021
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,400
- Bravo!
- Wow.

1022
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,200
Can you dig it?

1023
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,500
Skeetacus!

1024
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,400
How we doing so far, huh?

1025
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,500
- This is the best story yet.
- Can we get to the romance now?

1026
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,300
Well, shorty, you tell me?

1027
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,900
Does Skeetacus get
the girl he was after?

1028
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,500
In these stories,

1029
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,000
the hero always gets the fairest
maiden in the land.

1030
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,600
Yes! You said it!
OK, so it's gonna happen!

1031
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,700
Uh, right. So, what? They're thirsty?
They go off for drinks?

1032
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,300
A little wine and cheese action? Yes?

1033
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,400
Yeah, they can go to an old
tavern. And guess who's there?

1034
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
Led Zeppelin.
Say Led Zeppelin, please.

1035
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,300
No. All the girls that were mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

1036
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,700
What? Nobody was mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

1037
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,600
He was like
the coolest guy in school.

1038
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,600
That's not what Mom said.

1039
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,700
All right, everybody was
mean to Skeetacus.

1040
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,500
He had problems.
All right, tell your story.

1041
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,900
Oh, my God...

1042
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,300
They see he's now with

1043
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,100
the fairest maiden in all the land,

1044
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,600
and they are really jealous.

1045
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,800
So jealous they
don't know what to do.

1046
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,700
They just start nervously
doing the hokey-pokey.

1047
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,600
# Put your right hand in

1048
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,500
# You put your right hand out

1049
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,300
# You put your right hand in

1050
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,300
# And you shake it all about

1051
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,200
OK.

1052
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,300
So then,

1053
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,000
Skeetacus takes his date
out to the beach.

1054
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,300
All of a sudden,
a big hairy guy

1055
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,700
washes up onshore, passed out.

1056
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,600
Why a hairy guy?
I don't get it.

1057
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,800
Just 'cause.

1058
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,100
He had something stuck in his throat,
and he wasn't breathing.

1059
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,300
- Thanks.
- He's OK.

1060
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,500
And then it starts pouring,
so they run into a magical cave.

1061
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,600
- Caves are nice.
- And Abe Lincoln's there.

1062
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,000
Abe Lincoln?
What, is this a joke to you?

1063
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,900
What the heck's the matter with you?
Oh, I'm sorry.

1064
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,200
I, I didn't mean to yell.

1065
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,700
The Abe Lincoln thing, that's,
that's a good idea.

1066
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,800
It's just that, uh...
Does Skeetacus get a kiss?

1067
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,300
Don't you think he should?
It's... been a long time for him.

1068
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:52,400
His lips are very dry
from not using them.

1069
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,100
Bugsy, you with me?

1070
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,800
We'll see.

1071
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,400
- Hello?
- Mmm.

1072
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,100
Hey, is this the fairest maiden
in the land?

1073
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,200
Mr. Skeeter Bronson, is that you?

1074
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,600
Yes, it is. Sorry about that Ferrari
confusion the other night.

1075
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,100
I'm here at the beach right now
and I had a hunch you might be here too.

1076
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,900
What do you say
we get a little lunchsky?

1077
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,500
That sounds so delightful.

1078
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,600
But I can't. I'm afraid I'm
on my way to Vegas for the day.

1079
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,000
Vegas?

1080
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,500
Uh, no one talked about Vegas.

1081
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,800
Don't tell Kendall.
He thinks I'm in the library.

1082
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,200
Yeah, no. But, but, uh, princess,

1083
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,500
I, I really thought we
were gonna hang out today.

1084
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,300
Oh, well. I will see you
at Daddy's birthday party.

1085
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,300
Bye, Skeeter.

1086
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,300
Hmm.

1087
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,400
So our date's gonna be tomorrow?
I can live with that.

1088
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,500
Hey! Look out! Look out!

1089
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,900
Sorry. Are you OK? Hey! I'm so sorry!

1090
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,200
What is it about the cushion
of protection you don't like?

1091
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,800
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

1092
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,800
I'm supposed to be
looking for a job now,

1093
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,000
but for some reason I felt like
coming to the beach today.

1094
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,300
Huh.

1095
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,800
Um, are you hungry?

1096
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,900
Yes, I'm always hungry
when I'm in pain.

1097
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,100
Good. Because I'm buying.

1098
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,900
I'll let you buy me lunch.
Somebody stole my wallet,

1099
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,200
- so how was I gonna pay?
- Of course you got your wallet stolen.

1100
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,600
- I don't know what that means.
- You. It's always something with you.

1101
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,500
- Huh?
- You're wearing my hat.

1102
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,100
- Gonna wear that all day?
- I'm not wearing nobody's hat.

1103
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,800
- I'm wearing your hat! Oh!
- I'll take it back. Thanks.

1104
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,100
This is perfect for your free lunch.

1105
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,200
Oh, my gosh. You guys,
you guys, you guys. Over there.

1106
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,200
Is that...
is that Skeeter Bronson?

1107
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,700
- Stop it.
- Oh, my God.

1108
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,200
- Oh, my God.
- Skeeter.

1109
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,400
Hey! Do you remember me?

1110
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,400
It's Donna Hynde from high school.

1111
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,200
Yeah, I do.

1112
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,900
Thought I was going to run into you
shortly. And here you are.

1113
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,200
Yeah. Wow, this is so...
weird. Uh...

1114
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,800
We were just planning
our high school reunion.

1115
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,100
We were totally just talking about you.
It's so weird.

1116
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,100
I was just talking about you guys too.

1117
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,700
Sure, he was.

1118
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,400
Mind pretending to be
my girlfriend for a second?

1119
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,400
Yeah, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.

1120
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,900
I'll, uh, convert my truck to biodiesel.

1121
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,300
- OK, I'll do it.
- Ding-dong.

1122
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,500
Uh, this is my girlfriend,
guys. This is Jill.

1123
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,300
Hello.

1124
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,900
She's your girlfriend?

1125
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,400
Yeah. Yeah.

1126
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,000
Yes, I am.

1127
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,400
- Right?
- Yup.

1128
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,700
She thinks I'm...

1129
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,200
You want me to...
Oh. Uh... romantic.

1130
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,200
She likes how romantic I can be.

1131
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,200
And, uh, "great kisser,"
she likes to say.

1132
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,700
Oh, yeah. That's...
a little too much.

1133
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,800
- Oh. Sorry.
- Wow, you are really pretty.

1134
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,200
- I mean, she's all right.
- Thanks.

1135
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,100
I've seen hotter,
but she's pretty cool.

1136
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,500
So super skinny.

1137
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,200
Skinnier than you.
But... Yeah.

1138
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,600
Whatever.

1139
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,300
I feel really awful
saying this out loud.

1140
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,100
We were really terrible to Skeeter
in high school. Awful. So mean.

1141
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,700
My Skeeter?

1142
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,100
- They were.
- You had a hard time in high school?

1143
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,900
Look at you now.
You turned out pretty... cute.

1144
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,500
- Yeah!
- You know...

1145
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,700
the pimples went away,
and, uh, these came to play.

1146
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,200
- You want to touch them?
- Oh, that's OK.

1147
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,400
- Later, later.
- They're here for you. Ding-dong.

1148
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,300
# You put your right hand in

1149
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,800
# You put your right hand out

1150
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,500
# You put your right hand in

1151
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,400
- # And you shake it all about
- OK.

1152
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
- I think we should leave.
- Yes.

1153
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,400
# And you turn yourself around

1154
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,000
- All right. Bye-bye.
- # That's what it's all about #

1155
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,300
What's happening?

1156
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,700
Hey, so I spoke to Wendy.

1157
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,600
She's excited to see the kids tomorrow.

1158
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,700
This is the longest
she's been away from them.

1159
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:53,400
That's right.
This is my last night with the kids.

1160
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,300
You know,
they're gonna be devastated.

1161
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,000
They worship you

1162
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,800
and those amazing bedtime stories
you've been telling them.

1163
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,700
Oh, well, they say all the good parts.
I promise.

1164
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,800
Oh, my gosh.
Is he unconscious?

1165
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

1166
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,900
Boom! Oh.

1167
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,800
Thanks!

1168
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,000
Whoa!

1169
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,900
- Yeah?
- Check out Mr. Smooth.

1170
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,600
Well, you know, I do what I do.

1171
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:24,200
- Think we should get out of this rain?
- What rain?

1172
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,600
Oh, shoot!
Where did that come from?

1173
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,500
I don't know!
Isn't it amazing?

1174
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,700
- Let's get out of this!
- Let's go! Let's get out! Move it!

1175
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,900
I can read the future.

1176
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,300
Good God. So...

1177
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,600
So... The big presentation's
tomorrow, right?

1178
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,400
I know you're not nervous
or anything, but, um...

1179
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,800
good luck on it anyway.

1180
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,200
- Thank you.
- Yep.

1181
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:57,600
Actually, you can come
if you want. It's like a party.

1182
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,400
You know, Wendy's gonna be
watching the kids,

1183
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,800
and we could have fun.

1184
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,500
You can meet me there.

1185
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,600
Yeah. That would, uh...

1186
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,300
I could do that.
I could meet you, um...

1187
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,000
...after night school or something.

1188
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,000
It's you?

1189
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,300
It's me what?

1190
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,800
You're the fairest maiden in the land?

1191
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,000
"Fair" as in
"doesn't cheat at checkers"?

1192
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,500
No, fairest as in...

1193
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,200
..."beautifulest."

1194
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,000
Wait, wait.
Something weird's gonna happen.

1195
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,000
Oh.

1196
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,100
No, yeah, we don't...
This is a mistake.

1197
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:00,100
No, no, no, not between us.
I mean like, some...

1198
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,100
No! No, no!
Oh, here comes Abe!

1199
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,700
No!

1200
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,100
Ah! Look.

1201
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,600
- Wow, a penny.
- No, no, no.

1202
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,800
This is the weird thing
I was talking about. Abe Lincoln.

1203
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,800
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.

1204
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,800
Abe's not gonna interrupt
this time. That was it.

1205
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,600
It's supposed to end better than this.

1206
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,700
Stick around. I'm tellin' ya,
you're gonna be missing out.

1207
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,500
Nice imagination, Patrick.

1208
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,100
- Skeeter?
- Yo.

1209
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,900
We've got a little bit
of a shaving situation in there.

1210
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,300
Oh, no, no, no.
I took the razor blades out.

1211
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,200
Don't worry. Their father ain't around,

1212
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,400
I figured someone has to
teach them how to shave.

1213
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,500
I'm Princess Leia.

1214
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,200
Uh-huh.

1215
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,600
So, are you ready
for the big showdown tomorrow night?

1216
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,600
Oh, yeah.

1217
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,000
What I'm going to do is

1218
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,000
tell them a bedtime story tonight.

1219
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,900
I'll have me win in the story.

1220
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,500
Then I'll win for reals.
Do you dig?

1221
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,300
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, I understand.

1222
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,600
So it's like, um,
positive visualization.

1223
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,400
I read a book on that once.

1224
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,600
Read the back cover, at least.

1225
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,000
I can't read.

1226
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,800
Shut up, Bugsy!

1227
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,500
I've got opposable thumbs.
How do you feel about that?

1228
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,200
You children ready?

1229
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:44,000
Because here comes our last story.

1230
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,900
The fate of the entire universe

1231
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,800
hung in the balance,

1232
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,100
as the Supreme Galactic Council

1233
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,600
met to determine who would control

1234
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:59,900
the new planet in the vast
Nottinghamian star system.

1235
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,600
Most in attendance expected
Supreme Leader Barracto

1236
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,900
to rule in favor of General Kendallo,

1237
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,800
the evil governor of Hotelium.

1238
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,000
But there was a wild card in the mix...

1239
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,800
... Skeeto Bronsonnian

1240
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,900
and his sidekick,
Mickey Doo Quicky Doo.

1241
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,400
They all watched with excitement.

1242
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,100
Lieutenant Jilli
and her two young cadets,

1243
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:33,200
Aspenoff, and even
the great Captain Bugzoid.

1244
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,800
Hey, since it's outer space,
Skeeto should talk like a goofy alien.

1245
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,000
What?

1246
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:46,200
That's disgusting.
I'm not going to translate that.

1247
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,500
Silence!

1248
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,900
The leader of the new planet

1249
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,200
shall be determined
the old-fashioned way:

1250
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,500
A zero-gravity fight.

1251
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,500
OK, now we get to the part
the crowd came to see.

1252
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,700
Skeeto defeating Kendallo, right?

1253
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,300
I think we need
to see them battle first.

1254
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,900
Kendallo makes the first move.

1255
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,900
- Skeeto!
- But the kids

1256
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,100
really want to see Skeeto
kick his butt, right?

1257
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,000
Wet willy.

1258
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,600
Boring!

1259
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:04,400
Uh, bring out the booger monster!

1260
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,800
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

1261
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,200
All right, have the booger
monster smack Kendallo around.

1262
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,700
No, I think he should kiss him.

1263
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,900
Would you get
to Skeeto winning already?

1264
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,900
OK.

1265
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,800
Whoa!

1266
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:48,700
Arise, Skeeto,
sharif of Nottinghamia.

1267
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,500
- Whoopee!
- Whoo!

1268
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,700
And that is the perfect ending

1269
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,600
to our last story.

1270
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,100
Thank you, children.

1271
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,800
Oh, that's not the ending.

1272
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,800
Yeah. That would be too obvious.

1273
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,800
What do you mean?

1274
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,500
Somebody threw a fireball at Skeeto

1275
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,700
and Skeeto got incineratated.

1276
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:21,300
- The end.
- "Incineratated"?

1277
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:24,600
You mean "incinerated"?

1278
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,800
No! No, no!
He can't catch on fire.

1279
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,500
Yeah. I'm Captain Skeeto.
I'm on fire!

1280
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,000
No, no, no.
The story can't end like that.

1281
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,900
What happened to a nice, happy ending?

1282
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,100
You said happy endings
don't really happen.

1283
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,700
We want our story to be real.

1284
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,000
Oh, I was just saying that.
I was stupid.

1285
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,600
No, no, no, no, no.

1286
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,200
So, what? We're really going
to have me on fire? Hey!

1287
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,400
Don't fall asleep, or the story
will lock. Stop it! Wake up!

1288
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,900
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

1289
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,400
I can't believe
Skeeter didn't tell you.

1290
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,500
And I'm sure it's just a
coincidence that the new hotel

1291
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,400
is going up right here
where the, where the school is.

1292
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,400
Well, I'm pretty sure...

1293
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,400
Excuse me. Yeah.

1294
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,700
Everything's ready
for the presentation.

1295
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,200
- Good.
- Ten-four, rubber duck.

1296
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,900
Got it. Great.

1297
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:13,400
Fire]

1298
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,300
# Oh, uh

1299
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,000
# Fire

1300
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,600
I'm On Fire]

1301
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,100
# Oh, oh, oh
I'm on fire

1302
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,400
Eternal Flame]

1303
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,800
# Is this burning

1304
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,100
# An et...

1305
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,500
Disco Inferno]

1306
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,600
# Burn, baby, burn

1307
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:38,300
OK. The good news is,
you're going to win the competition.

1308
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,300
The bad news is,
you're probably gonna catch on fire,

1309
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,500
but not if you take a few precautions.

1310
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,600
Oven mitts, smoke alarm.

1311
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,200
Yeah.

1312
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:57,000
"Flame-resistant
Christmas tree spray." Yeah.

1313
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,900
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
this will work.

1314
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,700
Excuse me. Sir?

1315
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,600
Those are actually for Christmas trees.

1316
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,700
I know. 'Tis the season.

1317
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,000
- Ow! God!
- I'm so sorry.

1318
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,600
It burns!

1319
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,900
Here, let me make it up to you.

1320
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,800
- Ow!
- It's for trees!

1321
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,300
It's for trees!

1322
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,000
You're right! That hurts!

1323
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,300
I'm sorry about that!

1324
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:30,800
Antibacterial wipes, anybody?

1325
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,000
Aloha. Aloha.

1326
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,500
Thank you so much.

1327
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,300
Whoa!

1328
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,400
Steady. Steady.

1329
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,300
- Kona coffee ice cream.
- Yeah? What's the catch?

1330
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:53,000
You're gonna light it on fire?
'Cause I'm on to you, honey.

1331
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,100
No fire. It would melt.

1332
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,800
Just take the ice cream
and a chill pill.

1333
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,000
- Ah!
- Boo!

1334
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,500
- Skeeter.
- Yes.

1335
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,600
- That wasn't very nice.
- What wasn't?

1336
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,200
- You pushed that man in the pool.
- No, he jumped in.

1337
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,400
Hey, you see Jill around?

1338
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,300
No, I ain't, I ain't
seen Jill tonight, mate.

1339
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,000
Ooh! I am cold.

1340
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,700
I'll get you a towel.

1341
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,500
- I've got your towel.
- Oh, blimey.

1342
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1343
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,300
I love you.

1344
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,600
You brought me a grilled cheese
sandwich once.

1345
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,700
Yeah. I did, yes.

1346
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,700
It was Monterey Jack.
It's a good cheese.

1347
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,100
Ow!

1348
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,400
Skeeter, are you all right?

1349
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,200
A bee stung my tongue!

1350
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:03,200
The meeting for the exciting new hotel
will take place in the living room.

1351
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,100
So I don't think you're going
to want to miss this.

1352
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,300
No, it's swelling up!

1353
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,900
- Can I sit there, please, mate?
- Yes, of course.

1354
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,400
- Don't touch me.
- Sorry.

1355
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,300
Before we begin,
I would just like to say,

1356
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:24,000
personally, happy birthday.

1357
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,600
Happy birthday.

1358
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:26,900
Happy birthday, Daddy.

1359
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,300
Thank you, Kendall.

1360
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,000
Yes, now, as you can see,

1361
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,400
I've invited some of the staff to sit in

1362
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:37,100
to see how your ideas would
play with the "regular folk."

1363
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,200
- No offense.
- None taken, Barry. None taken.

1364
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,700
So, gentlemen,

1365
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,700
which of you would like to go first?

1366
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,300
Fair enough.

1367
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,600
Mr. Nottingham,
you were absolutely right

1368
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:56,200
when you said the rock and roll
theme was old hat.

1369
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,400
Gone. Your insight, sir,

1370
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,500
has inspired me to,
to dig deeper,

1371
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,400
to find the commonality
at the heart

1372
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,000
of the American experience.

1373
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I speak, of course...

1374
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
...of the musical theater.

1375
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,600
And, more specifically...

1376
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,900
...Broadway!

1377
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,800
Hit it.

1378
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,000
# Oh, when you first pull up

1379
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,100
# To the grand front door

1380
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:32,400
# There isn't just a bellhop
There's an overture

1381
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:37,900
# At the Nottingham
Broadway Mega Resort

1382
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
# Oh there's a pool
for the Sharks

1383
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,800
# A pool for the Jets

1384
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,500
# And you can bring Cats
'cause we take pets

1385
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,300
# At the Nottingham Broadway

1386
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:53,700
# Mega Resort #

1387
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:04,000
Original, impressive, well done.

1388
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,300
Thank you, Kendall.

1389
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,100
Thank you, sir.

1390
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,200
Uh, sorry about that.

1391
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,200
I was, uh,
just resting my eyes.

1392
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,400
Skeeter. You're up.

1393
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,800
Are you all right, Skeeter?

1394
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,300
A bee bit my tongue.

1395
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm sorry?

1396
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,800
A bee... stung my tongue.

1397
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,400
"A bee stung my tongue."

1398
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,500
Oh, you understand him? Oh.

1399
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,900
How did a bee sting your tongue?

1400
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,400
Uh...

1401
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,900
I was eating ice cream,
and suddenly a bee...

1402
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,400
Uh, it was on an ice cream,
and he licked it.

1403
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:17,500
Hmm. Can you translate
Skeeter's presentation for us?

1404
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,900
- Mmm!
- Uh... Yes!

1405
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,400
Yes, I can do that.

1406
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,300
Thank you. Ready?

1407
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,500
- I'm ready. OK.
- Ready?

1408
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:39,000
"I spent the last week in the hotel,
the hotel where I live..."

1409
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,400
With my niece and nephew.

1410
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,800
"With my niece and my nephew."

1411
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:53,200
"To a kid, everything about a
hotel is strange and wonderful."

1412
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,400
"Sleeping in a different bed."

1413
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,600
"Hanging out in the lobby."

1414
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,100
"Jumping up and down on the alligator."

1415
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,900
"Riding up and down in the elevator."

1416
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,100
Ah!

1417
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,000
Sorry. Yeah, I see now
that an alligator

1418
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,600
wouldn't be in that context.

1419
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:28,100
"Some hotels try to make it seem
as much like home as possible."

1420
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,900
"But they're missing
the point."

1421
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,300
"If you wanted to stay in a place
like home, then why not stay at home?"

1422
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,100
"Our guests should experience
an escape from the everyday."

1423
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,400
"And that's what I'd like to capture
in our new hotel."

1424
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:06,500
"What every kid knows
and what every adult has forgotten."

1425
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,100
"Like my father said to me,

1426
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:20,600
your fun is only limited
by your imagination."

1427
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,500
- That was beautiful.
- Yeah? All right. Settle down.

1428
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,000
Just the way it built.

1429
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:32,000
And that's it? I'm sorry.
I don't understand it.

1430
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,600
That... was... brilliant!

1431
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,900
Congratulations, my boy.
You've just won the keys to the kingdom.

1432
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:57,500
Boogie, don't do that. Germs.

1433
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,900
Congratulations. Great job.
Keep icing that tongue.

1434
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,400
- All right.
- Congratulations, Skeeter.

1435
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,400
- Congratulations. That was great.
- Yeah?

1436
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,000
That's just terrific.

1437
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:13,500
Congratulations, Skeeter.

1438
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,800
All right, Kendall.
Yeah. No hard feelings, pal.

1439
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,800
Of course not. You deserve it.
You're a better man than me.

1440
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:22,400
- You have an iron will.
- Yeah. That's what they say.

1441
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,900
I would not have the guts to tear down
the school my niece and nephew attend.

1442
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
What?

1443
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,100
You do know that's the site
for the new hotel?

1444
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,100
What are you talking about?

1445
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,400
- Good show, old son.
- Oh, sir.

1446
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:40,700
That bee sting language was really
working for you on a sympathetic level.

1447
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:43,400
Good, I'm glad. I wanted to talk to you
about the location

1448
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,900
that we're building the hotel.

1449
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,100
# Happy birthday to you

1450
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:50,400
# Happy birthday to you

1451
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,500
# Happy birthday

1452
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,500
Bronson, you're fired!

1453
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:22,200
Fired?

1454
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,500
Oh...

1455
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,600
That's how it connects.

1456
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,800
Yes?

1457
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:39,800
Do you know where
Jill Hastings' class is?

1458
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,200
It's right over there.

1459
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,600
Why won't you answer my calls?

1460
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:48,200
Because I know it's you calling.

1461
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,500
You got to believe me, Jill.
I had no idea...

1462
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:55,000
Don't destroy the sliver of respect
I have for you by making lame excuses.

1463
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,500
Just go away and stay away.

1464
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:06,000
Uncle Skeeter? Do you want
to incinertate our school

1465
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,900
'cause we incinertated you in the story?

1466
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,200
No, I wouldn't do that.

1467
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:14,100
We thought you were
supposed to be the good guy.

1468
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,400
So did I.

1469
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:51,500
"Skeeto defeats Kendallo."

1470
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,800
Not really.

1471
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:58,900
- Yeah?
- Hey.

1472
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,900
Oh, hey.
Welcome back.

1473
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,200
So, you mad at me, too?

1474
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:09,100
Not as mad as Jill,
but, uh, mad, yes.

1475
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,800
I didn't know the new hotel
was going up there.

1476
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,700
I figured that.

1477
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,900
Then what are you mad at?

1478
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,500
I gave the kids junk food?

1479
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,800
No, I figured you'd do that too.

1480
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,000
I'm mad because you told my kids

1481
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,400
that in real life
there are no happy endings.

1482
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,400
Well, look around you, Wendy.

1483
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,600
Do you see any happy endings here?

1484
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:36,300
I don't know. You and Dad always had
so much fun in this room.

1485
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,000
For whatever reason, I didn't.

1486
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:41,100
I was always the cynic,
the, the sourpuss.

1487
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,000
The black cloud.
The energy drainer.

1488
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,200
The... dead fish.

1489
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,900
Yes, all of those things.

1490
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
But when I left Bobbi
and Patrick with you,

1491
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:54,200
I guess I just was hoping
you'd rub off on them.

1492
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,500
Get them to be lighter.
Have fun. Enjoy themselves.

1493
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,100
I thought Dad would like that.

1494
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,800
Anyway, um, I got a job in Arizona.

1495
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,100
Teaching, not principaling.

1496
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,600
That's cool.

1497
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:12,800
Yeah, well, maybe you can come
visit when we get settled.

1498
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,500
I know by then the kids
will really want to see you.

1499
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,700
All right. Love you.

1500
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,100
Love you.

1501
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:34,700
And so Skeeter sat on his bed,
filled with regret,

1502
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,100
wondering how to put the pieces
of his life together

1503
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,200
after one magical week.

1504
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:43,000
- Great ending, huh?
- That was your ending, son?

1505
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:46,300
I thought this was just a sad part,
and you were about to make it better.

1506
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,200
What? How could I make it any better?

1507
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:50,800
Well, In the stories I told you,

1508
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,700
just when things looked bleakest,

1509
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,300
the hero would do something
unexpected and courageous

1510
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,200
to beat the bad guy,
save the day, and get the girl!

1511
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,300
Yeah. How can I do that?

1512
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,000
It's your story, not mine.

1513
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,200
But you better get moving.
Go get 'em, son.

1514
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,300
Mr. Nottingham! Mr. Nottingham?

1515
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,900
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a moment.

1516
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,200
My name is Jill Hastings.
I'm a teacher at Webster Elementary.

1517
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,800
Save our school!
Save our school!

1518
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:32,300
Save our school!
Save our school!

1519
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,100
Save our school!

1520
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,900
Save our school!

1521
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:39,000
My men are in position.
We are ready for the demolition.

1522
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,300
Excellent.
Mr. Nottingham said he'd call

1523
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,400
if he had a problem
getting the variance,

1524
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:46,100
so if we don't hear from him
in the next 20 minutes,

1525
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,200
I say we just... blow it all up.

1526
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:57,800
Madam, the war is over.
You lost. I'm sorry.

1527
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,700
This isn't a war, Mr. Nottingham.
We're talking about children.

1528
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,800
There must be other possible
sites for your hotel complex

1529
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:10,400
that would not result
in the displacement...

1530
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,400
Hey, hey! Barry, Jill.
How you doing?

1531
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,300
We're just wrapping up here.
Donna, you remember Jill, right?

1532
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:19,600
Of course! Oh, my God.
That jacket is so cute!

1533
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,500
Uh, thank you.

1534
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,100
Bronson, what are you doing here?

1535
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,600
What am I doing here?
Yeah, what am I doing here?

1536
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,500
Oh, uh, well, Mr. Bronson,
as a concerned citizen,

1537
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,300
wanted to bring points to my attention

1538
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,000
before I made any hasty
decisions about the property.

1539
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:38,400
And they are points that are going
to take me years to analyze.

1540
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,700
- Years?
- Years.

1541
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:44,300
Bronson, are you
playing hardball with me?

1542
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,700
I am, sir.

1543
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,000
Because your application
for variance has been...

1544
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,100
Denied.

1545
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:55,000
Denied?

1546
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,900
Yes. But the good news is

1547
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,400
Donna and I found you
another piece of property

1548
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:03,300
right on the beach in Santa Monica
that is uptight and out of sight.

1549
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,000
Beachfront was my first choice,
but it's not for sale.

1550
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,500
It is now.

1551
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,800
It is! Isn't that fabulous?

1552
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:11,400
Really?

1553
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,900
Friends?

1554
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Oh, oh.
Yeah, well, germs.

1555
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:18,600
Let's get past that.
Come here. Come here.

1556
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:22,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1557
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:24,900
I'm touching you,
and it's OK. Look at that.

1558
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,100
Aw...

1559
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:31,000
Ooh. You're enjoying it.
Good. Bring me closer.

1560
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:34,800
That is so sweet. And creepy.

1561
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:40,000
Attention, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

1562
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:44,400
We are working with highly-sensitive,
dangerous radio-controlled explosives.

1563
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,200
Boo!

1564
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:50,200
And so to avoid any tragic misfires,

1565
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,800
I would ask that you all
turn off your cell phones.

1566
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,100
All of you, please.
Turn your cell phones off.

1567
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,700
Did you really just fix everything?

1568
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,700
Not everything.

1569
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,500
- Yes?
- We appear to have a situation.

1570
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,500
I can't reach Kendall on his cell phone

1571
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,400
to halt the demolition
which will begin in... 13 minutes.

1572
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,400
This sign we made
is awesome!

1573
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:18,500
We need a window where
those construction guys can see it.

1574
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,400
Then they'll change their minds.

1575
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,700
Bobbi, I found one.

1576
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,800
That's my Prius!

1577
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,600
- OK. Where's your truck?
- My truck?

1578
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,800
I had to give it back to the hotel.

1579
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:36,400
What do you mean
you gave it back to the hotel?

1580
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,800
Come here!
Come here!

1581
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,200
Sorry!

1582
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,500
It's for a good cause!

1583
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,700
Have you ever driven a motorcycle?

1584
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,100
No!

1585
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,000
Oh, my God!

1586
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,600
No, no, no, no!

1587
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,200
Ooh! Yah! Booya!

1588
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:49,300
Have you seen Bobbi? Patrick?

1589
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,700
Bobbi! Patrick!

1590
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,500
What are you going to do?

1591
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,200
I'll take that back.

1592
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
No fair!

1593
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,500
Hey, people, that's 60 seconds!
Whoo-hoo!

1594
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,500
Wait! Wait a minute!
I can't find my children!

1595
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,700
- They might be in there!
- Nice try.

1596
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,600
We cleared the building hours ago. OK?
Everything is fine.

1597
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,700
No! Let me through!

1598
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:38,800
Hey, we got to check the rooms
before we start making booms.

1599
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,700
We've checked it already!

1600
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,000
Do it myself.

1601
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,000
Uncle Skeeter!

1602
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,600
Hey! Get out of there!

1603
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,000
- Five...
- No!

1604
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,600
- Grab the bar!
- Four...

1605
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:54,800
Three...

1606
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,100
Two...

1607
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:58,100
One!

1608
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:07,800
The king has issued a proclamation.

1609
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,900
The hotel moves away.

1610
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,400
The school will stay.

1611
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,700
Long live Webster Elementary!

1612
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,200
- Mom!
- Mom!

1613
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:23,800
Bobbi! Patrick!

1614
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,300
Oh!

1615
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,600
Hey, hey, hey.
You guys underdemeciated me.

1616
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,300
Come here! I just got to know you guys.

1617
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,900
You think I'm gonna let
you slip away from me now?

1618
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:40,600
I knew you were the good guy.

1619
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,000
Yeah.

1620
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:46,100
Uh, Patrick, hi.
I'm Trisha Sparks.

1621
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:49,500
I just wanted you to know that...
thanks for saving the school.

1622
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,200
Western. Go Western.

1623
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:58,000
- No thanks necessary, ma'am.
- That's my boy. That's my boy.

1624
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,100
There must be some way for me
to show my appreciation.

1625
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:07,900
Oh-ho-ho! Get it.

1626
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:13,000
Ooh! Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1627
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,800
Hey, isn't she a little old for you?

1628
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:17,800
- She's hot.
- So is she. What do you think?

1629
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:19,700
If Master Stinky's getting a kiss,

1630
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,900
shouldn't, shouldn't I get
a little mermaid action?

1631
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
- Come on, already.
- Ooh!

1632
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,000
Now look what my boy has done.

1633
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:44,900
Turned his back on the world
of luxury hotel management

1634
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,900
to start a small family business.

1635
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,200
And bless his heart,
he even named it after me.

1636
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,600
Hey, speaking of s'mores,
it looks like Bugsy ate them all.

1637
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,500
We're completely out of marshmallows.

1638
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:02,900
Oh, all right. Let me handle that.
Room service!

1639
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
- Yes, sir?
- Hi, Kendall.

1640
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,600
Uh, Bugsy's out of marshmallows.

1641
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:11,300
If you could just go get him some,
that would be great.

1642
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,900
Right on it, sir.
Anything else?

1643
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,100
Uh, not from you, Kendall, but, uh...

1644
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,800
...Housekeeping?

1645
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,800
Hey, Aspen.

1646
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:22,300
Could you just make sure
that Bugsy's cage is clean

1647
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,900
before he checks out in the morning?

1648
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,900
His marshmallows don't agree with him,
there's gonna be a mess.

1649
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,700
All right.

1650
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,500
OK, bye, guys.

1651
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,900
I think Bugsy
is trying to tell us

1652
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
that our tale has reached its end.

1653
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,800
But before I go, let me tell you

1654
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,200
what our heroes and villains
are doing now.

1655
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,200
My old friend, Barry Nottingham,

1656
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,800
overcame his fear of germs
to such a degree

1657
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:50,300
that he decided to leave
the hotel business

1658
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,900
and enter the field of medicine.

1659
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,300
He is currently the school nurse
at Webster Elementary.

1660
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,600
Violet now runs the hotel empire,

1661
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:02,100
along with her husband, Mickey,

1662
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,200
the former room service waiter

1663
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:07,100
who is now the ninth-richest
person in the world.

1664
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:10,200
And Skeeter and Jill?

1665
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:13,700
After the double wedding of the century,

1666
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:18,400
they lived... well, happily ever after,

1667
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,200
running Marty's Motel

1668
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:23,600
and spending a lot of time
with my grandkids,

1669
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,400
whose adventures have just begun.

1670
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:30,500
Though, not everyone
is quite so excited.

1671
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,400
But that is a whole other story.

1672
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,100
The end.

1673
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,500
Don't Stop Believin'

1674
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,800
# Don't stop believing

1675
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,300
# Hold on to that feeling

1676
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:47,600
# Streetlight people

1677
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:52,300
# Oh-oh-whoa

1678
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,200
# Don't stop believing

1679
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:59,800
# Hold on

1680
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:03,500
# Streetlight people

1681
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:08,100
# Oh-oh-whoa

1682
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,300
# Just a small town girl

1683
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,800
# Livin' in a lonely world

1684
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,100
# She took the midnight train

1685
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:39,600
# Goin' anywhere

1686
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,800
# Just a city boy

1687
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:49,200
# Born and raised in south Detroit

1688
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,400
# He took the midnight train

1689
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:56,400
# Goin' anywhere

1690
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,200
# A singer in a smoky room

1691
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,200
# A smell of wine and cheap perfume

1692
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:25,100
# For a smile
they can share the night

1693
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:29,600
# It goes on and on
and on and on

1694
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:33,800
# Strangers waiting

1695
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:37,400
# Up and down the boulevard

1696
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,800
# Their shadows

1697
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:44,100
# Searching in the night

1698
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:49,800
# Streetlight people

1699
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:54,100
# Living just to find emotion

1700
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,800
# Hiding

1701
01:34:55,900 --> 01:35:00,700
# Somewhere in the night

1702

# Working hard to get my fill

1703
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:18,600
# Everybody wants a thrill

1704
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:21,700
# Paying anything
to roll the dice

1705
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:25,500

1706
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,300
# Some will win

1707
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,600
# Some will lose

1708
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:34,200

1710
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:41,800

1712
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:49,400

1713
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,700
# Their shadows

1714
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:56,100
# Searching in the night

1715
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:01,600
# Streetlight people

1716
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:05,900

1718
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000

1720
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:37,900
