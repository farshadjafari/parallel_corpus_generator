1
00:01:40,964 --> 00:01:43,199
... it therefore appears
to be evident that,

2
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,152
when the defendant,
Josselin Beaumont,

3
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:49,104
arrived in Malagasy
on the 14 th of May,

4
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:54,360
he had the full intention
to make an attempt on the life

5
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:59,616
of Colonel Njala, President
of the Republic of Malagasy.

6
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:05,238
lt is hard to believe
that the defendant claims

7
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:10,860
to be acting in his own
initiative, Mr. President.

8
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:13,195
You admit to coming
to Malagasy

9
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:18,468
for the sole purpose
of killing President Njala?

10
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,769
Yes, Mr. President.

11
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,908
Are you aware of how
deplorable such crime is?

12
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:29,011
Yes, Mr. President.

13
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:33,574
And you were not subject
to any political manipulation?

14
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:40,155
Are you aware,
Josselin Beaumont,

15
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:46,026
that l'll have to set an example
with your punishment?

16
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:52,432
Defendant, answer the
Attorney General's question!

17
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,379
The defendant
will rise!

18
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:15,992
The defendant needs to be
excused because of the heat.

19
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:18,517
The session is suspended
until further notice.

20
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,345
No, no, no, no!

21
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:12,814
No more of that!

22
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:15,682
You're driving me crazy
with that stuff!

23
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:27,430
Hey, what's
wrong with you?

24
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:30,065
Come on.

25
00:04:30,066 --> 00:04:33,098
Don't be difficult now,
come on.

26
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:36,130
l don't want
anymore of that!

27
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:39,841
See?

28
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:42,811
Be reasonable,
come here.

29
00:05:16,145 --> 00:05:17,746
Very well,

30
00:05:17,747 --> 00:05:19,647
put his clothes
back on.

31
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:31,251
Let go of him, now.

32
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:44,904
Well, Mr. Beaumont...

33
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:55,183
Perfect, excellent.

34
00:05:55,184 --> 00:06:00,655
Let's continue where
we got interrupted.

35
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:08,064
l'll have to set an example
with your punishment.

36
00:06:08,065 --> 00:06:10,714
Yes, Mr. President.

37
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:13,364
There we go, good!

38
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:20,209
Do you think you deserve
an exemplary punishment?

39
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,311
Yes, Mr. President.

40
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:25,781
Make three copies for me,
one for the President's staff,

41
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:29,484
one for Matignon
and one for Colonel Martin,

42
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:33,155
so all our friends can read it
every once in a while.

43
00:06:33,156 --> 00:06:34,789
Yes, Mr. President.

44
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,691
We are reporting live
from the courthouse,

45
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:39,128
where Josselin Beaumont's trial
is presently under way.

46
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:41,429
lt seems that only
the President's grace

47
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,955
can save the terrorist
from capital punishment.

48
00:06:46,836 --> 00:06:48,404
Everything depends on
the infinite compassion

49
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:50,572
of your Excellency.

50
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:52,642
lf we want to gain
the sympathy of the French,

51
00:06:52,643 --> 00:06:55,410
Beaumont must be
a very sick man,

52
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:57,470
so we'll have to
teach him a thing or two.

53
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:44,687
Up, get up, pig!

54
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:46,120
Get up!

55
00:08:55,564 --> 00:08:57,930
You bastard!

56
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:03,140
Hurry up, get out of here,
they're coming!

57
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:09,885
The soldiers are
getting closer!

58
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:12,683
Get out, get out!

59
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:30,536
Don't stay here!

60
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,433
Hurry,
they're coming.

61
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:08,467
Ready?

62
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:09,832
Almost.

63
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:32,650
They're
coming closer.

64
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,963
Don't shoot!

65
00:15:35,964 --> 00:15:37,332
We'll sneak out
through the back.

66
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,629
Okay.

67
00:15:48,477 --> 00:15:49,603
No!

68
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:09,090
Am l going to die?

69
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:13,662
Yes...
are you afraid?

70
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:17,632
No, why?

71
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:22,169
Because l would be.

72
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,504
That's because
you'd go to hell.

73
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:49,458
What does
''Ludo Koda'' mean?

74
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:50,859
That's the signature.

75
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,724
Oh, okay.

76
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:58,532
Captain Valera.

77
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:02,867
We got this strange telegram,
could you come up for a second?

78
00:19:10,746 --> 00:19:12,279
l don't understand
any of it.

79
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,516
lt doesn't seem like
any of the codes we're using.

80
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:15,968
Where was it sent from?

81
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:17,418
From around the corner.

82
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:20,217
lt looks like the code
we used in Africa.

83
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:25,626
That's really weird,

84
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:29,564
you know how long it's been
since we used those codes?

85
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:31,699
More than two years,
Captain!

86
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,653
Who would use a code
that's two years old?

87
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:37,605
Someone who disappeared
for two years.

88
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:40,632
Well, we'll know more when
we put it into the decoder.

89
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:08,736
Hello?

90
00:20:08,737 --> 00:20:09,971
Hello, Alice?

91
00:20:09,972 --> 00:20:11,472
Edouard.

92
00:20:11,473 --> 00:20:13,241
Am l bothering you,
were you in the bathtub?

93
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:15,109
No, l just got here.

94
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,103
Excellent, then you can just get
into a taxi and come over here.

95
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,420
Alice,
did you hear me?

96
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:27,923
Yes, Edouard.

97
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:30,424
And hurry!

98
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:33,561
Why?
What's going on?

99
00:20:33,562 --> 00:20:36,698
Nothing good,
hurry up.

100
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:38,188
Yes.

101
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:55,375
Joss Beaumont
to Colonel Martin.

102
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,553
Go call the colonel!

103
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:03,358
- Call him, where?
- Anywhere, and do it now!

104
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,159
This is not funny!

105
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,064
Joss Beaumont is back!
Bravo, he's very strong!

106
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:10,999
So what does it say
in this telegram?

107
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,398
One second.

108
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:16,738
lt says that the contract
will be fulfilled

109
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:18,874
between the 12th
and the 15th.

110
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,211
The contract between
the 12th...

111
00:21:22,212 --> 00:21:25,546
The 12th...
starts in an hour!

112
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:27,615
And let me remind you that
President Njala

113
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:30,951
will be in France from
the 12th until the 15th.

114
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:35,056
That's why we didn't hear from
Beaumont after he escaped.

115
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:36,724
l'll be right with you.

116
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:39,761
Call Rosen, from our
special section immediately.

117
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:43,015
And tell Alice Ancelin to stay,
she might be useful.

118
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:46,268
And call the guy from
the shooting school there,

119
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,202
he could
help find Beaumont,

120
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:50,605
What's the name of
that brute again?

121
00:21:50,606 --> 00:21:52,440
The instructor, Picard.

122
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,175
That's it, Picard.

123
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:58,480
And above all, find the Minister
for me, will you?

124
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:00,165
l want to be covered!

125
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,849
Understood, Colonel.

126
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,417
- Captain Valera!
- Yes?

127
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:06,955
Put Joss Beaumont's wife under
surveillance immediately.

128
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:08,556
lsn't it a crazy idea
to go there?

129
00:22:08,557 --> 00:22:10,892
And the telegram, that's even
crazier, don't you think?

130
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:12,723
Sure, Colonel.

131
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,642
Maybe we should
let his wife know.

132
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:30,406
What do you think
l'm doing?

133
00:22:35,317 --> 00:22:37,410
Somebody's on the line
with her right now.

134
00:22:40,188 --> 00:22:43,057
Hello,
surveillance service--

135
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:45,326
Can't you give them
a few minutes?

136
00:22:45,327 --> 00:22:49,097
Jeanne, dariing, you'll be
under surveillance very soon,

137
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:51,183
so we won't
be able to talk.

138
00:22:51,184 --> 00:22:53,694
No, Joss,
don't hang up!

139
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:56,203
Please, Joss,
come here!

140
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:59,007
They'll probably come
to your place.

141
00:22:59,008 --> 00:23:00,341
As soon as they're gone,

142
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:02,675
you close the shades
in the living room,

143
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:05,008
and l'll come see you
during the night.

144
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,611
What, what is it?

145
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:41,727
l'm clean, l took
a shower last month!

146
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:45,843
All right, yes,
where's the truck?

147
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:51,059
Oh, you're not
the police?

148
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,094
What time is it?

149
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:56,131
What do you want
in exchange?

150
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:57,631
- An associate.
- What?

151
00:23:57,632 --> 00:24:00,735
An associate to
do some business for me.

152
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:03,404
Are you aware,
Josselin Beaumont,

153
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:10,578
that l'll have to set an example
with your punishment?

154
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:13,715
You are a monster,
Josselin Beaumont.

155
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:15,876
Obviously!

156
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:24,259
And you were not subject to
any political manipulation?

157
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,145
Yes,
Mr. President.

158
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:30,030
Josselin Beaumont,

159
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:34,092
are you aware of the
recklessness of your plan?

160
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:39,139
Gentlemen.

161
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,641
Good morning, Martin.

162
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:43,510
Thank you for coming, sir.

163
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:47,749
l have to rest a little bit, l...

164
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,451
Do you have coffee?

165
00:24:49,452 --> 00:24:51,536
Of course.

166
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:53,620
Alice.

167
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:55,088
Yes, sir,
l'll bring some.

168
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:02,630
l hoped for
a good night's sleep,

169
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:05,400
l've been sleeping
terribly lately.

170
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:08,602
l took a sleeping pill.

171
00:25:08,603 --> 00:25:10,472
Did l ask
for some coffee?

172
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:11,706
Here it is, sir.

173
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:13,907
Thank you.

174
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:15,967
So, l'm all ears,
Colonel Martin.

175
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,785
Josselin Beaumont
is in Paris.

176
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:26,687
Who's that?

177
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:28,922
Commander
Josselin Beaumont,

178
00:25:28,923 --> 00:25:31,776
an agent of
the Special Action Service,

179
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:35,322
He came back after
two years of captivity.

180
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:38,867
His return is causing us
major problems.

181
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:40,494
Why is that?

182
00:25:43,238 --> 00:25:45,840
He wants to kill
President Njala.

183
00:25:45,841 --> 00:25:47,041
Njala?

184
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:50,534
Kill Njala, but why?

185
00:25:56,184 --> 00:26:01,088
lt's not easy
to explain...

186
00:26:01,089 --> 00:26:07,050
Well, we...
how should l put it?

187
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:18,006
Because we gave him the order
to do it, two years ago.

188
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:20,074
Who's ''we''?

189
00:26:20,075 --> 00:26:23,044
Your predecessor, sir.

190
00:26:23,045 --> 00:26:24,446
Marchadeau?

191
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:25,779
Yes.

192
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,182
Philippe Marchadeau?

193
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:29,483
Yes, sir.

194
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:32,619
l can explain
his political motives--

195
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,625
That's not necessary.
What happened exactly?

196
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:42,630
Well, we sent
Commander Beaumont to Africa.

197
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:44,565
You've already
told me that.

198
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:49,003
Miss, would you give me a little
bit of coffee, please?

199
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:50,838
l'm listening.

200
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:53,674
When he arrived
in Malagasy,

201
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:57,362
the political situation
had completely changed,

202
00:26:57,363 --> 00:27:01,049
there was no more need
to kill President Njala.

203
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,217
Of course not!

204
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:05,720
So, did you
call Beaumont back?

205
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:09,557
No, sir.

206
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:13,393
Why?

207
00:27:13,394 --> 00:27:16,631
Would you like some cognac
in your coffee, sir?

208
00:27:16,632 --> 00:27:20,001
l'm asking you,
why you didn't call him back?

209
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:23,370
Well, because we considered
it appropriate

210
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:31,613
to inform President Njala
of Beaumont's presence.

211
00:27:31,614 --> 00:27:34,381
You sold him!

212
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:41,922
No, sir, not sold,
we gave him for free...

213
00:27:41,923 --> 00:27:44,756
for governmental reasons,
usually that means for free.

214
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:48,662
Let me introduce you
to my associate.

215
00:27:48,663 --> 00:27:53,500
He'll explain everything
about our business to you.

216
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:56,037
We'll walk around together
and l'll tell you what to do.

217
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:57,438
What do we get
out of this?

218
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:59,206
Yeah, what?

219
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:00,807
Ask my associate.

220
00:28:00,808 --> 00:28:03,144
Don't worry,
you won't regret it.

221
00:28:03,145 --> 00:28:05,180
He's an honest guy.

222
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:06,531
Can we go?

223
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:08,270
Okay, yeah.

224
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,009
Let's go.

225
00:28:21,196 --> 00:28:23,460
Hey, slow down,
we're not athletes!

226
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:46,054
l'd really like to know
why he sent this message.

227
00:28:46,055 --> 00:28:49,156
Why?

228
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:54,929
Look at us, sir, this is only
our first sleepless night.

229
00:28:54,930 --> 00:29:00,100
There'll be many more.

230
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:01,869
What are you
planning to do?

231
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,903
Whatever it takes.

232
00:29:02,904 --> 00:29:06,473
Ha l lt's not gonna be
a piece of cake.

233
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:10,011
lnstructor Picard, he's the one
who trained Beaumont.

234
00:29:10,012 --> 00:29:12,180
That's the worst
part of it, sir,

235
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:14,349
Beaumont knows
all the tricks.

236
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,816
And why?

237
00:29:15,817 --> 00:29:17,452
Because we taught him
every single move,

238
00:29:17,453 --> 00:29:19,519
every clever turn.

239
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,055
He was my favorite
student, sir.

240
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:26,294
lf l had a son, l'd want
him to be like Beaumont.

241
00:29:26,295 --> 00:29:28,428
That's very touching,

242
00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:31,465
but it won't help us
solve our problems.

243
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:36,971
lf he's that good, it'll be
very difficult to stop him.

244
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:42,477
Still he'll have to move around,
contact some people.

245
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:44,144
Unfortunately not,

246
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:46,314
l taught him how to be
completely self-sufficient,

247
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:48,849
to operate in
enemy territory.

248
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,052
Whatever the circumstance,
he's got the ''white ones''.

249
00:29:51,053 --> 00:29:52,085
Huh?

250
00:29:52,086 --> 00:29:53,920
lt's a term used in chess.

251
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:55,790
The white ones have the benefit
of the offensive.

252
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:57,824
He'll always be
one step ahead.

253
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:59,627
He'll pull some
amazing tricks on us!

254
00:29:59,628 --> 00:30:01,228
He'll improvise everything.

255
00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:03,527
He'll know where we are,
he'll drive us crazy!

256
00:30:45,707 --> 00:30:47,407
Beaumont won't come here.

257
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:50,310
The whole night we'll
sit around for nothing.

258
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:52,280
lf you were free tonight,
would you go see your wife?

259
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:54,082
No, l'd go see yours.

260
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,634
Very funny.

261
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:57,184
Go ahead!

262
00:30:57,185 --> 00:30:59,676
You dirty bastard!

263
00:31:03,758 --> 00:31:05,593
- What's this?
- lt's a bunch of bums.

264
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:07,695
They seem
completely drunk.

265
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:09,526
Go, for God's sake!

266
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:13,935
They stole my cognac!

267
00:31:13,936 --> 00:31:15,664
My cognac!

268
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:25,411
Follow me!

269
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,165
Get lost,
you stinkin' drunks!

270
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,395
Get out of here!

271
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,660
Help me, you idiot!

272
00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:53,333
l can't, l'm stuck!

273
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:57,945
Go, out of the way
get lost!

274
00:31:57,946 --> 00:31:59,413
What's this?

275
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:01,449
lt's my alarm clock, for when
l take my little nap.

276
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,440
Go, get lost already!

277
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:15,395
on a little boat...

278
00:32:15,396 --> 00:32:19,093
Hey, my alarm clock,
my alarm clock!

279
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:26,240
Maybe now is a good time to have
a little coffee, isn't it?

280
00:32:26,241 --> 00:32:27,502
Yes, you're right.

281
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:34,047
What is it with
this shitty neighborhood?

282
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,285
lt's a shitty neighborhood,
all neighborhoods are shitty,

283
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:38,585
and it's not
gonna change because

284
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:41,522
they put a little bit
of green in it!

285
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:44,184
lt stinks like
the gutter here.

286
00:32:47,295 --> 00:32:50,430
Gentlemen, l find you
to be very pessimistic.

287
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:53,568
Remember, Beaumont had to first
go through brainwashing,

288
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:55,502
then two years
of brutal treatment in Malagasy,

289
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:58,906
and finally the difficulties
of his extravagant escape.

290
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:00,475
He's probably weak and tired.

291
00:33:00,476 --> 00:33:01,660
Weak and tired?

292
00:33:01,661 --> 00:33:02,843
On the contrary,

293
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:06,247
the Biribian regime had to
invigorate Beaumont.

294
00:33:06,248 --> 00:33:08,515
He'll be at his best!

295
00:33:08,516 --> 00:33:10,918
Let me tell you
one thing, sir.

296
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,519
There's a lot on the line.

297
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,257
l mean, if the politicians don't
kick him out soon enough,

298
00:33:16,258 --> 00:33:18,476
then, boom!
No more blacks!

299
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:20,270
Enough!
Thank you, Picard!

300
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:22,134
Wait, l'm not finished.

301
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:23,997
Thank you, Picard!

302
00:33:31,506 --> 00:33:34,442
Gentlemen, after that brilliant
thesis, let me tell you this:

303
00:33:34,443 --> 00:33:36,611
if there's no more blacks,
there's no more service,

304
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:37,644
and no more Minister.

305
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:39,780
Boom!
The whole worid would blow.

306
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:42,099
No, we'll get him!

307
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,418
We'll stop him.

308
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:45,886
Stop him?

309
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:49,357
Who will stop him?

310
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:51,892
l will.

311
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:55,727
lnspector Rosen from
the lntervention Bureau.

312
00:34:01,636 --> 00:34:05,732
Joss...
ls that you, Joss?

313
00:34:21,122 --> 00:34:23,290
Two years!

314
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,526
l almost went out of my mind
waiting for you.

315
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:28,361
Jeanne, l've hurt you
so much already.

316
00:34:28,362 --> 00:34:31,126
l don't want to give you
fieas on top of it.

317
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:37,267
The guy who gave me this coat
hasn't seen soap in years.

318
00:34:40,274 --> 00:34:44,574
One minute of tenderness,
hours of itching.

319
00:34:58,225 --> 00:35:02,379
Did you tell Alice Ancelin
that you're back?

320
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,534
Forget Alice Ancelin,
it's been two years...

321
00:35:06,535 --> 00:35:09,354
with expiration today.

322
00:35:09,355 --> 00:35:12,172
l haven't forgotten.

323
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:15,608
And l'm sure
she hasn't either.

324
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:19,044
Now l'm here with you,
aren't l?

325
00:35:24,085 --> 00:35:27,121
The service called me just
two minutes after you did.

326
00:35:27,122 --> 00:35:29,189
Valera.

327
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,726
He told me
about the telegram.

328
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:35,528
Why didn't you come here
before you sent it?

329
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:38,065
lt was the telegram that
triggered the surveillance,

330
00:35:38,066 --> 00:35:40,601
the searching the apartment,
the roadblocks downstairs.

331
00:35:40,602 --> 00:35:44,070
Why did you
do that, Joss?

332
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:48,242
Did you come here to see me,
or to play with them?

333
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:54,614
Your return, is it for love
or provocation?

334
00:35:54,615 --> 00:36:02,957
Valera told me you want to kill
Njala, that you went crazy!

335
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:05,459
l couldn't stand
losing you once again, Joss!

336
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,587
l love you.

337
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,368
l don't like them,
Jeanne.

338
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:17,972
They've killed a soldier
named Josselin Beaumont,

339
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:21,408
he was killed in ambush,
years ago...

340
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:23,377
You can imagine, it took
a lot of explaining

341
00:36:23,378 --> 00:36:25,679
before they sent
me down there,

342
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,949
before l would slide
their guns into my suitcase.

343
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,784
They told me that
Njala was a monster,

344
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:36,323
that he had to be killed,
that it'd be an honor to do it.

345
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:41,862
l had foolish conceptions about
honor and pride back then.

346
00:36:41,863 --> 00:36:45,699
l was so wide-eyed
and eager.

347
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,467
l hate them, Jeanne, and l want
them to pay for what they did.

348
00:36:51,205 --> 00:36:53,940
ln the beginning,
Valera came every Sunday,

349
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:57,745
then every other Sunday,
then every three weeks.

350
00:36:57,746 --> 00:36:59,780
Then one night,
he came and said to me,

351
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:01,815
''l'll resign.''

352
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:03,216
The papers had just announced

353
00:37:03,217 --> 00:37:05,852
your trial and your
condemnation.

354
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:09,356
His resignation was refused,
but he handed it in.

355
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:13,293
Yes, he did.

356
00:37:13,294 --> 00:37:15,696
At what time does the concierge
throw out the garbage?

357
00:37:15,697 --> 00:37:17,464
Around seven,
seven thirty.

358
00:37:17,465 --> 00:37:19,799
Put the bum's clothes
and the alarm clock

359
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,503
on top of the garbage,
so that it is cleariy visible.

360
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:24,605
Why, what are
you gonna do?

361
00:37:24,606 --> 00:37:27,207
l'm leaving.

362
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,442
They'll certainly
pay you a visit.

363
00:37:29,443 --> 00:37:33,280
Hopefully it'll be Martin,
in the worst case, Rosen.

364
00:37:33,281 --> 00:37:35,649
He's a bastard,
but a great cop.

365
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,018
He'll definitely
come to bother you.

366
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:39,786
And then?

367
00:37:39,787 --> 00:37:41,254
Then he'll leave.

368
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:43,424
No, l'm talking about
the two of us.

369
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:45,391
Listen, Jeanne,

370
00:37:45,392 --> 00:37:50,330
right now, there is
Njala, Rosen, Martin,

371
00:37:50,331 --> 00:37:56,604
the four of us, the six of us
the twelve of us.

372
00:37:56,605 --> 00:37:59,087
As long as all these people
are involved,

373
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:01,570
there'll be no such thing
as the two of us.

374
00:38:25,566 --> 00:38:26,700
Hello.

375
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:27,902
Edouard?

376
00:38:27,903 --> 00:38:29,102
Joss.

377
00:38:29,103 --> 00:38:31,939
l'm at Jeanne's,
but l won't be for much longer,

378
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,175
'cause l can smell
Rosen's arrival.

379
00:38:34,176 --> 00:38:35,742
Why Rosen?

380
00:38:35,743 --> 00:38:39,079
As if you didn't know.
lt would be better if you came.

381
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,847
Why are you calling?

382
00:38:40,848 --> 00:38:42,615
You know
we're being tapped.

383
00:38:42,616 --> 00:38:44,784
lt's illegal to tap people's
lines, isn't it?

384
00:38:44,785 --> 00:38:49,323
The noise you just heard was
birds sitting on the cable.

385
00:38:49,324 --> 00:38:51,621
Be a good boy,
come here.

386
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:54,371
The concierge brought out
the garbage.

387
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:58,893
l put your stuff in
just in time... Joss?

388
00:39:58,894 --> 00:40:01,259
Joss?

389
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:45,232
So, Mr. lnspector,
now you're a garbageman?

390
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:51,211
Tell Rosen
to come immediately.

391
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:52,545
Beaumont was here.

392
00:40:52,546 --> 00:40:54,181
Tell the others, too, ask them
if they noticed anything.

393
00:40:54,182 --> 00:40:55,149
How did he do it?

394
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,582
The bum!

395
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:02,355
Where is he?

396
00:41:02,356 --> 00:41:05,120
Where is he? l not gonna
ask you fifty times!

397
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:36,220
He's gone.

398
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:41,361
l'm warning you,
you better not mess with us!

399
00:41:41,362 --> 00:41:44,531
So, l just found the clothes in
the trash, and the alarm clock.

400
00:41:44,532 --> 00:41:45,623
l recognize it,
l know it was him.

401
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:49,402
So, for the last time,
where did he go?

402
00:41:49,403 --> 00:41:52,802
You're making a big mistake
by not telling me anything.

403
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:56,201
Rosen's methods are a lot
less pleasant, believe me!

404
00:41:58,078 --> 00:42:00,672
You won't get him,
anyway!

405
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:06,678
Bitch!

406
00:42:07,788 --> 00:42:10,279
Farges, Rosen is coming,
l'll get him.

407
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:15,794
lt's on the sixth fioor.

408
00:42:18,966 --> 00:42:20,831
Good morning,
lnspector.

409
00:42:22,102 --> 00:42:24,832
Morning, lnspector Farges
is waiting for you upstairs.

410
00:42:34,915 --> 00:42:37,717
Bravo,
my compliments, Farges.

411
00:42:37,718 --> 00:42:40,846
He came and left again and all
that right in front of you!

412
00:42:44,525 --> 00:42:47,960
Then again,
l understand you well.

413
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:50,864
You were waiting for
a nervous officer by himself,

414
00:42:50,865 --> 00:42:53,767
instead you see a group of bums
drinking and singing.

415
00:42:53,768 --> 00:42:57,254
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

416
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:00,741
You're certainly right,
lnspector Farges...

417
00:43:00,742 --> 00:43:02,971
<i>Assistant
lnspector Farges.</i>

418
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:09,944
So, get lost now
and lift all the roadblocks.

419
00:43:16,423 --> 00:43:18,482
He won't come back.

420
00:43:20,294 --> 00:43:25,631
Very funny, the alarm clock
in the garbage.

421
00:43:25,632 --> 00:43:28,502
Are you gonna tell me
when he left now, or what?

422
00:43:28,503 --> 00:43:31,003
Who?

423
00:43:31,004 --> 00:43:36,210
Miss Beaumont, please,
when did he leave?

424
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:39,046
l don't know.

425
00:43:39,047 --> 00:43:41,966
Where is he now?

426
00:43:41,967 --> 00:43:44,884
l don't know.

427
00:43:44,885 --> 00:43:47,521
Where are you going
to see him again?

428
00:43:47,522 --> 00:43:51,924
l don't know.

429
00:43:51,925 --> 00:43:53,793
l think l'm
losing my patience.

430
00:43:53,794 --> 00:43:56,463
Don't get carried away,
lnspector, there's no point.

431
00:43:56,464 --> 00:43:59,032
She's protecting him,
she can't help it.

432
00:43:59,033 --> 00:44:02,368
lt's love, passion!

433
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:04,804
lt's nobody's fault,
really.

434
00:44:04,805 --> 00:44:07,207
You're certainly right,
sergeant,

435
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,376
l shouldn't
get carried away.

436
00:44:09,377 --> 00:44:11,544
l beg your forgiveness,
Madame.

437
00:44:13,247 --> 00:44:19,752
See, he apologizes,
that's how he is.

438
00:44:19,753 --> 00:44:24,758
You might become good friends
if you tell him the truth.

439
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:28,861
l'm sure
you're gonna tell me.

440
00:44:28,862 --> 00:44:31,430
When are you going to see
Beaumont again?

441
00:44:31,431 --> 00:44:36,103
l'm not sure that your
friendliness is very effective.

442
00:44:36,104 --> 00:44:40,207
Sure, we're getting
along just fine.

443
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:42,142
You'll tell me,
won't you?

444
00:44:42,143 --> 00:44:44,610
The whole truth.

445
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:47,848
You'll tell me the whole truth,
l know you will.

446
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:51,684
You're looking
pretty good, giri.

447
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:54,121
Beaumont must have been more
than happy to see you again,

448
00:44:54,122 --> 00:44:56,889
after two long years!

449
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:01,929
Your eyes look like you didn't
get too much sleep tonight.

450
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,697
l'm sure you two
were having fun last night,

451
00:45:03,698 --> 00:45:07,084
a lot of fun...

452
00:45:07,085 --> 00:45:10,469
fun... fun!

453
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:13,574
After a night!ike that,
you must want to take a shower,

454
00:45:13,575 --> 00:45:15,075
a nice warm shower?

455
00:45:15,076 --> 00:45:16,442
No.

456
00:45:16,443 --> 00:45:21,215
A warm shower, and then a cold
one and then a hot one.

457
00:45:21,216 --> 00:45:22,782
No l

458
00:45:22,783 --> 00:45:24,150
l'll soap you
from head to toe.

459
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:26,745
You'd be surprised by what
l can do with a bar of soap.

460
00:45:29,656 --> 00:45:34,527
l'm begging you,
stop playing these games.

461
00:45:34,528 --> 00:45:40,067
Miss Beaumont, l cannot remain
in the room with a naked lady.

462
00:45:40,068 --> 00:45:45,405
That would be against
the regulations, wouldn't it?

463
00:45:45,406 --> 00:45:47,674
Sergeant, you take
care of Miss Beaumont.

464
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:49,843
lf that's an order,
lnspector.

465
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:51,577
No use in screaming.

466
00:45:51,578 --> 00:45:53,847
Rosen couldn't care less about
what l'm going to do with you,

467
00:45:53,848 --> 00:45:55,414
as long as
l make you talk.

468
00:45:55,415 --> 00:45:57,985
And if it helps to find
this son of a gun, Beaumont,

469
00:45:57,986 --> 00:45:59,919
He won't even care if
l rape you.

470
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:04,658
You'll see,
it's very healthy l

471
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:06,827
And good for
the blood circulation.

472
00:46:06,828 --> 00:46:08,694
That's what they do
in Sweden.

473
00:46:08,695 --> 00:46:10,364
Afterward,
they spank each other...

474
00:46:10,365 --> 00:46:11,665
Do you want me
to spank you?

475
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:13,428
Oh, you're so cute.

476
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,227
All right.

477
00:46:52,105 --> 00:46:54,471
Oh, she's soaking.

478
00:47:27,607 --> 00:47:29,871
Rosen, l'm always
right behind you.

479
00:47:34,114 --> 00:47:36,195
You knew he was there,
didn't you?

480
00:47:36,196 --> 00:47:38,277
l'll get him yet,
l'll get him!

481
00:47:54,134 --> 00:47:56,728
Oh, Edouard!

482
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:15,021
You know, Rosen, now l know how
we can find Joss Beaumont.

483
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:17,790
We'll follow you everywhere,
my friend!

484
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:20,594
Because the day someone puts
a bullet through your head,

485
00:48:20,595 --> 00:48:23,825
Joss won't be far!

486
00:48:37,077 --> 00:48:40,013
That was smart,
now you have no more coffee.

487
00:48:40,014 --> 00:48:42,548
Leave it.

488
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:44,784
That's for me.

489
00:48:44,785 --> 00:48:46,653
l didn't want to hit her,
l swear.

490
00:48:46,654 --> 00:48:47,950
Rosen had me do it.

491
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:58,348
l didn't want to hit you either,
but my wife asked me to.

492
00:48:58,349 --> 00:49:03,804
Come on, commander, it's my job,
l hate to slap people.

493
00:49:03,805 --> 00:49:07,340
You're right,
that's your job.

494
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:08,637
lt's your job.

495
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:26,225
The croissant
is on my friend there.

496
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,629
And he'll stay
for three days.

497
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,699
That's a long time,
a very long time.

498
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,805
Not for us, we're hoping to
trade a part of his reserves

499
00:50:11,806 --> 00:50:15,007
for a nuclear plant
with immediate access.

500
00:50:15,008 --> 00:50:18,745
Three days is no time at all
to be able to convince him.

501
00:50:18,746 --> 00:50:25,048
Right, but it's more than
enough time to kill him.

502
00:50:29,322 --> 00:50:31,057
Your Excellency, l'm sorry
to disturb you, but--

503
00:50:31,058 --> 00:50:32,525
That's all right, Arthur.

504
00:50:32,526 --> 00:50:35,428
The colonel of the security,
Martin, wants to see you.

505
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:37,481
l'll receive him
after dinner or tomorrow.

506
00:50:37,482 --> 00:50:39,533
Your Excellence,
tomorrow you have a meeting

507
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:40,867
with the President
of the Council.

508
00:50:40,868 --> 00:50:42,568
lt'll be a busy day.

509
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:44,454
Well, in that case,
l won't see him at all.

510
00:50:44,455 --> 00:50:46,339
lt must be very urgent,
your Excellency,

511
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,873
he's waited for
more than an hour.

512
00:50:47,874 --> 00:50:50,210
They let me
wait fifteen years, Arthur,

513
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:52,745
and for the most part,
in prison.

514
00:50:52,746 --> 00:50:55,374
One little hour
certainly did him no harm.

515
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:02,255
Gentlemen, his Excellency
can see you now.

516
00:51:02,256 --> 00:51:04,155
This way, please.

517
00:51:08,361 --> 00:51:11,631
How are you planning to handle
my protection in this case?

518
00:51:11,632 --> 00:51:14,751
We understand that this palace
can offer great comfort

519
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:17,870
and the neighborhood certainly
is a very pleasant one,

520
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:20,874
but right now, l'm afraid it is
not the safest place for you.

521
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:22,207
Too many come and go here,

522
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:24,610
and it is hard
to keep track of everyone.

523
00:51:24,611 --> 00:51:27,581
As far as safety is concerned,
this is a disaster.

524
00:51:27,582 --> 00:51:29,515
Please, tell me
if l'm mistaken,

525
00:51:29,516 --> 00:51:32,052
l hope you don't intend
to lock me in my embassy.

526
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:34,553
Of course not, Mr. President.

527
00:51:34,554 --> 00:51:36,856
We would have never
even thought of such a thing.

528
00:51:36,857 --> 00:51:38,558
Does your Excellence
need anything else?

529
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:39,858
No, thanks.

530
00:51:39,859 --> 00:51:41,660
So where are you
planning to keep me?

531
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:44,464
Luckily, there's many castles
in our country.

532
00:51:44,465 --> 00:51:46,031
Unless you're talking about

533
00:51:46,032 --> 00:51:47,767
the Senate's Palace
in the Luxembourg gardens,

534
00:51:47,768 --> 00:51:49,702
l am afraid you must
be referring to

535
00:51:49,703 --> 00:51:51,771
one of your giant isolated
castles in the country,

536
00:51:51,772 --> 00:51:53,907
where your kings
died of boredom.

537
00:51:53,908 --> 00:51:57,676
Oh, l'm sorry!

538
00:51:57,677 --> 00:51:59,804
l thought you
were alone.

539
00:52:04,384 --> 00:52:06,686
Miss Frederiksen.

540
00:52:06,687 --> 00:52:08,522
Hello, Miss.

541
00:52:08,523 --> 00:52:10,356
Doris, my love,

542
00:52:10,357 --> 00:52:12,559
what do you think of
the French countryside?

543
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,584
Yuk!

544
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:32,946
You heard it, reason dictates
what politeness forbids.

545
00:52:32,947 --> 00:52:34,675
So long, gentlemen.

546
00:52:36,616 --> 00:52:37,883
Good evening.

547
00:52:37,884 --> 00:52:39,943
- To you, too.
- Thanks.

548
00:52:49,162 --> 00:52:51,096
Shit, another one.

549
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:14,654
So, what's
the first question?

550
00:53:14,655 --> 00:53:17,145
Doris Frederiksen.

551
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:21,827
Having been faithful to
his Excellency for years now,

552
00:53:21,828 --> 00:53:27,357
she recently began an affair,
very ltalian and passionate.

553
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:31,354
You got it!

554
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:33,305
With whom?

555
00:53:33,306 --> 00:53:37,210
Volfoni Salvatore that's
the ice cream and soda Volfoni.

556
00:53:37,211 --> 00:53:38,929
Correct!

557
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:40,646
And where?

558
00:53:40,647 --> 00:53:42,081
ln the Hilton Hotel.

559
00:53:42,082 --> 00:53:44,751
l can even tell you where to
reach Miss Doris Frederiksen.

560
00:53:44,752 --> 00:53:46,285
Wrong!

561
00:53:46,286 --> 00:53:49,722
2250563, under
the name of ''Miss Claude''.

562
00:53:49,723 --> 00:53:53,159
One wrong answer
and you lose everything.

563
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,922
You're good,
though!

564
00:53:56,229 --> 00:53:58,789
Please hold, l'll
put her on the phone.

565
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,217
lt is Madame.

566
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:02,510
Madame who?

567
00:54:02,511 --> 00:54:03,624
Madame.

568
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:04,737
Hello?

569
00:54:04,738 --> 00:54:05,971
Hello, Doris?

570
00:54:05,972 --> 00:54:07,473
Yes, is that you?

571
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:09,476
ls four to five
tomorrow good for you?

572
00:54:09,477 --> 00:54:10,976
That depends
on who it is!

573
00:54:10,977 --> 00:54:12,645
l have the black man
coming tomorrow at seven.

574
00:54:12,646 --> 00:54:14,346
Salvatore Volfoni.

575
00:54:14,347 --> 00:54:18,118
Ah, Salvatore, that's different,
at the Hilton?

576
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,487
Suite 1056.

577
00:54:20,488 --> 00:54:22,855
Oh Claude,

578
00:54:22,856 --> 00:54:25,256
send this to
lnspector Rosen.

579
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:32,031
Doris Frederiksen?

580
00:54:32,032 --> 00:54:33,565
Yes.

581
00:54:33,566 --> 00:54:38,003
lnspector Rosen,
from the savage squad.

582
00:54:38,004 --> 00:54:40,540
Someone is planning
to kill President Njala.

583
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:42,292
l thought l'd warn you.

584
00:54:42,293 --> 00:54:44,042
How does
that concern me?

585
00:54:44,043 --> 00:54:46,562
Let's say you're
the president's weak spot.

586
00:54:46,563 --> 00:54:49,057
The killer will try
to get to him through you.

587
00:54:49,058 --> 00:54:51,551
ln case he contacts you,
try to keep him there,

588
00:54:51,552 --> 00:54:53,752
and call me immediately
at this number.

589
00:54:53,753 --> 00:54:58,224
Two of my men will follow you
for a few days.

590
00:54:58,225 --> 00:55:01,027
You're not even asking
for my consent?

591
00:55:01,028 --> 00:55:03,830
Your consent?
l couldn't care less.

592
00:55:03,831 --> 00:55:05,631
And what if l refuse?

593
00:55:05,632 --> 00:55:07,700
lf you refuse,
you'll have an accident,

594
00:55:07,701 --> 00:55:10,336
for example,
in the elevator.

595
00:55:10,337 --> 00:55:11,970
The cable will snap,

596
00:55:11,971 --> 00:55:14,168
and they'll find you
six stories down

597
00:55:14,169 --> 00:55:16,365
with your stiletto heels
up your throat.

598
00:55:18,311 --> 00:55:20,905
See you soon,
mademoiselle.

599
00:55:26,686 --> 00:55:28,187
Yes.

600
00:55:28,188 --> 00:55:30,323
Mr. Volfoni,
the ice-cream-and-soda man?

601
00:55:30,324 --> 00:55:31,490
Yes.

602
00:55:31,491 --> 00:55:35,291
Joss Beaumont,
espionage and ass-kicking!

603
00:55:52,545 --> 00:55:54,714
Does it amuse you to follow me
around like this?

604
00:55:54,715 --> 00:55:56,883
We're not doing this
for fun, we're working.

605
00:55:56,884 --> 00:55:57,951
Where are you going?

606
00:55:57,952 --> 00:56:00,317
To work.

607
00:56:03,456 --> 00:56:06,186
From here on,
it's private!

608
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:16,835
- Who is it?
- Doris.

609
00:56:16,836 --> 00:56:19,930
l'm coming.
Good boy, stay there.

610
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,283
Oh, l'm sorry,
this must be the wrong room.

611
00:56:30,284 --> 00:56:31,650
ls this 1056?

612
00:56:31,651 --> 00:56:34,119
lt is.
l have to apologize.

613
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,788
l came with no notice,
impromptu,

614
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:37,189
even a little shameless.

615
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:39,926
Salvatore didn't tell me
that we'd be three.

616
00:56:39,927 --> 00:56:42,796
l don't have
a problem with it, but--

617
00:56:42,797 --> 00:56:45,665
Three, Salvatore,
ah, good old Salvatore.

618
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:46,865
Where is my head?

619
00:56:46,866 --> 00:56:48,925
Yes, he's in the closet,
next to the ties.

620
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:51,637
Which closet?

621
00:56:51,638 --> 00:56:55,441
l should have specified,
this is a suite, after all.

622
00:56:55,442 --> 00:56:57,242
l never lie.

623
00:56:57,243 --> 00:56:58,477
l hope he won't
get too wrinkled.

624
00:56:58,478 --> 00:57:00,145
l didn't have the time
to put him on a hanger.

625
00:57:00,146 --> 00:57:03,182
What sort of behavior is this,
to lock people into closets?

626
00:57:03,183 --> 00:57:06,352
l needed to see you
privately, alone.

627
00:57:06,353 --> 00:57:08,254
l heard a lot about you.

628
00:57:08,255 --> 00:57:10,807
From whom?

629
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:13,358
The black man.

630
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:14,893
Would you happen to be
the delinquent

631
00:57:14,894 --> 00:57:18,298
that this furious cop
was talking to me about?

632
00:57:18,299 --> 00:57:19,831
The furious guy,
did he give you his,

633
00:57:19,832 --> 00:57:22,802
''Rosen, from the savage squad,
l'll make you eat your shoes''?

634
00:57:22,803 --> 00:57:26,406
He didn't say my shoes,
he said my stilettos.

635
00:57:26,407 --> 00:57:28,074
What does this brute
want from me?

636
00:57:28,075 --> 00:57:29,808
Rosen?

637
00:57:29,809 --> 00:57:31,877
He'd just love
to kill me.

638
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:34,712
But in order to do that,
he needs to catch me,

639
00:57:34,713 --> 00:57:37,546
and in order to catch me,
he's counting on you.

640
00:57:41,421 --> 00:57:44,407
And you, what do you
have in mind?

641
00:57:44,408 --> 00:57:46,518
Do you really
want to kill Njala?

642
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:48,424
Would that cause you
a lot of pain?

643
00:57:48,425 --> 00:57:50,329
Well, no,
that's not the point.

644
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:52,799
But if you put one half of my
sugar daddies in the closet,

645
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,132
and kill the other half,

646
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:57,002
l'll end up
with nothing to wear!

647
00:57:57,003 --> 00:57:59,872
Well, that's just
an expression.

648
00:57:59,873 --> 00:58:01,873
Listen,
let's make a deal.

649
00:58:01,874 --> 00:58:03,241
You can keep Njala
for a little longer,

650
00:58:03,242 --> 00:58:05,611
long enough to get a maximum
of money out of him,

651
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:07,981
and in exchange,
you'll do me a favor.

652
00:58:07,982 --> 00:58:09,748
A favor?

653
00:58:09,749 --> 00:58:12,051
Yup, you'll tell Rosen that
l asked you plenty of questions

654
00:58:12,052 --> 00:58:16,088
about Njala's safety,
the number of body guards,

655
00:58:16,089 --> 00:58:20,426
the placement of his bed,
his habits, that kind of thing.

656
00:58:20,427 --> 00:58:24,096
How does that help you?

657
00:58:24,097 --> 00:58:26,164
Rosen won't be able
to sleep at night.

658
00:58:26,165 --> 00:58:29,502
And when you don't sleep,
your hands start trembling,

659
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,636
your head
becomes clouded,

660
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:36,025
let's say it could
be to my advantage.

661
00:58:36,026 --> 00:58:40,413
He asked me to keep you here
and call him.

662
00:58:40,414 --> 00:58:42,347
And you think
that's amusing?

663
00:58:42,348 --> 00:58:45,785
No, l was just thinking that
l wouldn't be so against

664
00:58:45,786 --> 00:58:49,222
the thought of keeping you
here... without calling him.

665
00:58:49,223 --> 00:58:51,490
Where is that lunatic now?

666
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:53,726
Talking about espionage
and ass-kicking.

667
00:58:53,727 --> 00:58:55,125
Work is calling.

668
00:58:57,964 --> 00:58:59,264
l won't say anything.

669
00:58:59,265 --> 00:59:03,069
l won't say a word or ask
any questions, but get out!

670
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:04,369
What are you doing here?

671
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:06,973
l am responsible for this,
and l'm leaving.

672
00:59:06,974 --> 00:59:09,159
Pierrot returned
to Columbine

673
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,343
on tipped toes
goes the hariequin

674
00:59:11,344 --> 00:59:13,780
You can't walk out like this,
there's two cops outside.

675
00:59:13,781 --> 00:59:15,615
Are you nuts,
they'll jump right on you!

676
00:59:15,616 --> 00:59:17,382
lt doesn't matter,

677
00:59:17,383 --> 00:59:19,908
l have what is called
''the surprise factor''.

678
00:59:58,057 --> 01:00:00,287
Some couscous with chicken
anyone?l

679
01:00:01,861 --> 01:00:07,467
First, Mrs. Beaumont,
then the presidential whore,

680
01:00:07,468 --> 01:00:09,502
soon enough we'll be
the only ones in Paris

681
01:00:09,503 --> 01:00:11,537
who didn't meet
Commander Beaumont yet.

682
01:00:11,538 --> 01:00:13,505
My congratulations,
gentlemen.

683
01:00:13,506 --> 01:00:16,642
Excuse me, Colonel, but l can't
keep an eye on Mrs. Beaumont,

684
01:00:16,643 --> 01:00:19,512
on the presidential whore and
the five miles of hallways

685
01:00:19,513 --> 01:00:22,115
at the lntercontinental
at the same time.

686
01:00:22,116 --> 01:00:24,634
The lntercontinental
is no longer safe.

687
01:00:24,635 --> 01:00:27,152
We're moving the President
somewhere else.

688
01:00:27,153 --> 01:00:30,406
Don't you remember how he
reacted to this idea?

689
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:33,659
Because it was ours,
now it's the higher-up's.

690
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,360
Where are you
going to put him?

691
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:39,364
ln the Ferriere castle
in the countryside.

692
01:00:39,365 --> 01:00:43,903
Two towers, one main building,
one story and a pavilion,

693
01:00:43,904 --> 01:00:45,770
with a great view.

694
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:48,106
- And Beaumont?
- What about him?

695
01:00:48,107 --> 01:00:50,610
Well, Beaumont, should we stop
him or shouldn't we now?

696
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:52,929
Of course we should!

697
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:55,247
Why are you asking?

698
01:00:55,248 --> 01:01:02,255
l'm not asking you,
Colonel, l'm asking Valera.

699
01:01:02,256 --> 01:01:05,724
You're sick
in the head, Rosen!

700
01:01:05,725 --> 01:01:08,945
l think l know what
you're getting at.

701
01:01:08,946 --> 01:01:11,890
What are you
interrogating Valera for?

702
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:14,764
l'm not interrogating him,
Colonel,

703
01:01:14,765 --> 01:01:17,637
l'm just asking him
whose side he's on.

704
01:01:17,638 --> 01:01:20,523
Our's or Beaumont's?

705
01:01:20,524 --> 01:01:23,408
Just a question!

706
01:01:23,409 --> 01:01:25,461
lf l remember correctly,
you and Joss

707
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:27,513
were very close friends,
weren't you?

708
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:29,147
What are you
trying to say?

709
01:01:29,148 --> 01:01:33,052
l'm simply saying that if
someone he trusts, like Valera,

710
01:01:33,053 --> 01:01:39,252
asked Joss Beaumont
for a meeting, he'd come.

711
01:01:42,028 --> 01:01:46,298
lsn't that a good idea?

712
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:48,733
You're even sicker
than l thought!

713
01:01:53,406 --> 01:01:56,342
Well, the previous maneuvers
weren't successful.

714
01:01:56,343 --> 01:01:58,343
l'm trying something else.

715
01:01:58,344 --> 01:02:01,997
The other tricks didn't work
out, so you invent another one,

716
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:05,651
preferably one that's even
more deceitful than your last.

717
01:02:05,652 --> 01:02:12,056
No, Alice...
a meeting is not always a trap.

718
01:02:15,895 --> 01:02:20,583
Captain, l think
lnspector Rosen might be right.

719
01:02:20,584 --> 01:02:25,271
ln any case,
if anybody meets with Beaumont,

720
01:02:25,272 --> 01:02:28,069
it will have to be you.

721
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:41,203
All right,
l'll try to contact Joss.

722
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:45,516
But l want you to
promise me something.

723
01:02:45,517 --> 01:02:49,829
Give me enough time
to convince him,

724
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:52,130
or at least to try.

725
01:02:52,131 --> 01:02:55,251
Of course we will, Edouard!

726
01:02:55,252 --> 01:02:58,371
lsn't that right,
Colonel?

727
01:02:58,372 --> 01:03:01,373
Obviously!

728
01:03:01,374 --> 01:03:03,908
Edouard,
how can you say that?

729
01:03:03,909 --> 01:03:07,647
You know them, you know very
well that they want to kill him.

730
01:03:07,648 --> 01:03:10,683
That's their only purpose,
their only desire.

731
01:03:10,684 --> 01:03:13,870
That's why
l want to see him.

732
01:03:13,871 --> 01:03:17,055
He's gone too far,
Jeanne.

733
01:03:17,056 --> 01:03:21,159
He has to cut
this bullshit out!

734
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,063
lf l can't make him
understand that tonight,

735
01:03:24,064 --> 01:03:26,865
it's gonna be too late.

736
01:03:26,866 --> 01:03:30,201
Well, l can't
promise anything,

737
01:03:30,202 --> 01:03:33,655
but if Joss calls me,
l'll tell him to meet you,

738
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:37,109
but only if you swear
that Joss doesn't have

739
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:41,414
anything to fear
from you.

740
01:03:41,415 --> 01:03:43,746
l swear.

741
01:03:48,654 --> 01:03:52,556
That's good, Valera.

742
01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:06,136
Really good job,
Edouard.

743
01:07:22,001 --> 01:07:25,653
Y'know, you're cute when
you pretend you're sleeping.

744
01:07:25,654 --> 01:07:29,305
l'm not pretending, why do
you think l was pretending?

745
01:07:38,017 --> 01:07:40,035
Two years,
Edouard.

746
01:07:40,036 --> 01:07:42,053
Two years, what?

747
01:07:42,054 --> 01:07:46,325
You were gonna ask how long it's
been since we saw each other.

748
01:07:46,326 --> 01:07:47,959
Two years.

749
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,429
l know that it's been
two years.

750
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:51,963
What's so funny?

751
01:07:51,964 --> 01:07:54,033
Because l'd like to see
Martin's face

752
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:56,968
if he saw us together now.

753
01:07:59,939 --> 01:08:04,193
l mean, you can always
hand in your resignation.

754
01:08:04,194 --> 01:08:08,447
They won't accept it anyway,
so there's no risk.

755
01:08:08,448 --> 01:08:10,182
Did Jeanne tell you about
my resignation?

756
01:08:10,183 --> 01:08:15,354
Yes, and how
it impressed her,

757
01:08:15,355 --> 01:08:18,690
which isn't surprising.

758
01:08:18,691 --> 01:08:22,411
l can literally see you
telling her,

759
01:08:22,412 --> 01:08:25,456
''Jeanne, l resigned
this morning.''

760
01:08:25,457 --> 01:08:28,499
Just like you told me
not so long ago,

761
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,338
''Joss, l would love to be
in your place and go.''

762
01:08:33,339 --> 01:08:38,177
You're good at these kind of
scenes, you know that?

763
01:08:38,178 --> 01:08:39,912
Do you
have some coffee?

764
01:08:39,913 --> 01:08:41,646
lt's ready, l'll get it.

765
01:08:43,582 --> 01:08:45,583
Speaking of Jeanne,
do you think it was

766
01:08:45,584 --> 01:08:47,318
really necessary to go
to her house and see her?

767
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:52,591
Her house, that's funny,
don't forget l live there, too!

768
01:08:52,592 --> 01:08:55,311
Oh, look,
the ''Condor lnterceptor''.

769
01:08:55,312 --> 01:08:58,030
Didn't l bring you that
from Hong Kong?

770
01:08:58,031 --> 01:09:00,131
Yes.

771
01:09:00,132 --> 01:09:02,801
lt wasn't your robots
that drove me crazy,

772
01:09:02,802 --> 01:09:05,169
it was your batteries.

773
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:09,507
German batteries don't work
in Japanese robots.

774
01:09:09,508 --> 01:09:14,013
Batteries from Brittainy don't
work in robots from Auvergne.

775
01:09:14,014 --> 01:09:15,832
How's Alice?

776
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,649
Fine, why?

777
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:20,119
Did she decode
my telegram?

778
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,819
Yes.

779
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,555
Did she think
it was funny?

780
01:09:23,556 --> 01:09:25,757
Not, really, no.

781
01:09:25,758 --> 01:09:28,594
She would have preferred to have
heard from you before that.

782
01:09:28,595 --> 01:09:33,699
Me, too, actually,
everybody would have.

783
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,668
How many do you have now?

784
01:09:35,669 --> 01:09:37,502
What?

785
01:09:37,503 --> 01:09:41,439
How many robots
do you have now?

786
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,778
Oh, more than a hundred,
a hundred and fifty, maybe.

787
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:48,546
A small army almost.

788
01:09:48,547 --> 01:09:52,918
And cops, how many are here,
around us, everywhere?

789
01:09:52,919 --> 01:09:56,988
Also a small army?

790
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:02,528
l don't know,
but there are a lot.

791
01:10:02,529 --> 01:10:05,129
We have some on the roofs,

792
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,467
in the unmarked car,
there's Louviers and Farges.

793
01:10:08,468 --> 01:10:10,935
You really put him
in his place.

794
01:10:10,936 --> 01:10:15,774
ln the back there's Ropert,
Dugoineau and Perrin.

795
01:10:15,775 --> 01:10:17,176
Down there,
at the corner of this building,

796
01:10:17,177 --> 01:10:19,077
there's Vittoret
and Goulet,

797
01:10:19,078 --> 01:10:21,345
ln the cafe,
Martin and Michalon.

798
01:10:21,346 --> 01:10:23,315
Why did you come here
if you saw them?

799
01:10:23,316 --> 01:10:25,968
Because you asked me to,
Edouard.

800
01:10:25,969 --> 01:10:28,620
l wanted to see you
to make you stop

801
01:10:28,621 --> 01:10:31,223
before it
is too late, Joss.

802
01:10:31,224 --> 01:10:33,826
They'll shoot you
like a dog...

803
01:10:33,827 --> 01:10:36,761
and what for?

804
01:10:36,762 --> 01:10:39,965
Things have completely changed
in the last two years,

805
01:10:39,966 --> 01:10:43,134
the political
circumstances changed.

806
01:10:43,135 --> 01:10:48,774
And... l've changed,
everything has changed.

807
01:10:48,775 --> 01:10:51,008
Except Njala
and the Service.

808
01:10:51,009 --> 01:10:53,011
And if it was good
to kill Njala then,

809
01:10:53,012 --> 01:10:54,779
it must still
be good now.

810
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,681
Well, maybe it wasn't good
then, either.

811
01:10:56,682 --> 01:10:59,284
Then you shouldn't have
convinced me that it was!

812
01:10:59,285 --> 01:11:03,338
l don't understand
your stubbornness, Joss.

813
01:11:03,339 --> 01:11:07,392
l'm wondering,
who do you hate more now?

814
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:10,996
Njala or the Service?

815
01:11:10,997 --> 01:11:14,999
Guess.

816
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,703
Enough of this...
how am l gonna get out?

817
01:11:17,704 --> 01:11:19,604
On my feet, of course.

818
01:11:19,605 --> 01:11:21,273
Maybe you could give
me the password,

819
01:11:21,274 --> 01:11:22,941
now that you've put
spies all around.

820
01:11:22,942 --> 01:11:25,076
Joss,
you don't understand.

821
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:28,103
lt's over, no more,
finito, hopeless.

822
01:11:45,798 --> 01:11:48,600
No, dear Edouard,
it's not over.

823
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:50,397
lt's overdue.

824
01:11:52,404 --> 01:11:54,005
What the hell is this?

825
01:11:54,006 --> 01:11:57,542
The press,
the democratic press.

826
01:11:57,543 --> 01:12:00,679
They haven't written anything
about me in two years.

827
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,848
So l suggested they
do a follow-up.

828
01:12:03,849 --> 01:12:06,468
What, what did you tell them?
What did you say?

829
01:12:06,469 --> 01:12:09,113
l told them they
could have live coverage of

830
01:12:09,114 --> 01:12:11,757
the execution of an
agent of the Secret Service.

831
01:12:11,758 --> 01:12:14,093
They were
more than happy!

832
01:12:14,094 --> 01:12:16,427
Are you out of your mind?

833
01:12:16,428 --> 01:12:18,096
That is against
all the rules!

834
01:12:18,097 --> 01:12:19,765
ls it in the rules of
the Service

835
01:12:19,766 --> 01:12:21,999
to sell one of its agents?

836
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,369
And the call you made
to Jeanne this morning,

837
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:27,099
is that part of
the rules, too?

838
01:12:37,082 --> 01:12:40,702
Hey guys, thanks
for being on time.

839
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:44,322
Ladies and gentlemen
of the press,

840
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:48,093
l'd like to inform you
that l'm in good health.

841
01:12:48,094 --> 01:12:49,962
l just came back
from my vacation,

842
01:12:49,963 --> 01:12:51,462
l have plenty of friends,

843
01:12:51,463 --> 01:12:54,633
and therefore no reason
to commit suicide.

844
01:12:54,634 --> 01:12:57,286
l'm saying this
so you know in case

845
01:12:57,287 --> 01:12:59,937
you find me lying
on a doormat.

846
01:12:59,938 --> 01:13:04,509
l just need to walk down
two stories to get to you,

847
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,739
so l'll see you
in a minute.

848
01:13:16,655 --> 01:13:18,489
Why are you doing that?

849
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:19,858
Because l have
to walk downstairs

850
01:13:19,859 --> 01:13:22,053
with my back to you.

851
01:13:26,131 --> 01:13:27,894
Joss!

852
01:13:38,777 --> 01:13:40,540
That bastard!

853
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,939
Block the doorway.

854
01:13:53,692 --> 01:13:57,296
lf you mind the light,
turn it off.

855
01:13:57,297 --> 01:13:59,730
Whatever you like,
Colonel,

856
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:01,866
l can either use
the main entrance,

857
01:14:01,867 --> 01:14:05,670
and answer all the questions
that are being asked,

858
01:14:05,671 --> 01:14:09,474
or l take the back door
and you call your men back.

859
01:14:09,475 --> 01:14:10,975
Take the back door.

860
01:14:10,976 --> 01:14:14,813
ln that case, l want a car
and nobody around, got it?

861
01:14:14,814 --> 01:14:17,748
Call back Ropert,
Dugoineau, and Perrin.

862
01:14:17,749 --> 01:14:20,218
You, Louviers, bring a car
to the back entrance.

863
01:14:20,219 --> 01:14:22,053
All right.

864
01:14:22,054 --> 01:14:25,285
There you go,
that's much better!

865
01:18:46,885 --> 01:18:50,956
l didn't think
Edouard could convince you.

866
01:18:50,957 --> 01:18:54,025
lt's just a scratch,
it's nothing,

867
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:56,323
but it's bleeding
like crazy.

868
01:19:07,472 --> 01:19:11,135
Thank you for
sending me fiowers.

869
01:19:18,516 --> 01:19:22,119
You see, Alice,
l ran and ran and ran,

870
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:26,291
and l had a plan that
l was not to forget on the road.

871
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:30,312
As soon as l arrived
in Paris, l knew the odds,

872
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:34,332
Colonel Martin's smile,
the fist of Valera.

873
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:36,384
You don't call him
Edouard anymore?

874
01:19:36,385 --> 01:19:40,413
No, l don't call him
Edouard anymore.

875
01:19:40,414 --> 01:19:44,442
Valera's fist,
the irreproachable Jeanne,

876
01:19:44,443 --> 01:19:47,011
the wonderful Alice,

877
01:19:47,012 --> 01:19:51,583
in short, all the reasons why
l couldn't do what l had to.

878
01:19:51,584 --> 01:19:53,851
That's why
l sent the telegram,

879
01:19:53,852 --> 01:19:57,222
so that all these reasons
wouldn't exist,

880
01:19:57,223 --> 01:20:00,592
so that my craziness
would be irreparable.

881
01:20:00,593 --> 01:20:04,662
A guy's allowed
to change his mind.

882
01:20:04,663 --> 01:20:11,403
My point exactly.
Even if l did, what for?

883
01:20:11,404 --> 01:20:15,007
The machine
already started running.

884
01:20:15,008 --> 01:20:18,961
There's just screams,
orders, targets.

885
01:20:18,962 --> 01:20:22,320
There's only two targets,
Njala and me.

886
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:25,678
l must admit,
l wish there was only one.

887
01:20:28,253 --> 01:20:31,255
Eariier the door,
now the window...

888
01:20:31,256 --> 01:20:32,924
Do you really think that
anyone would be sick enough

889
01:20:32,925 --> 01:20:35,292
to look for you here?

890
01:20:35,293 --> 01:20:41,299
l know two sick guys,
Rosen and Farges,

891
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:45,469
especially Rosen.

892
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:51,108
What if we both left,
what would Rosen find here?

893
01:20:51,109 --> 01:20:55,714
Well, there's a few things we
could do, we could make plans,

894
01:20:55,715 --> 01:21:00,552
take an airplanes,
and get out the sunscreen.

895
01:21:00,553 --> 01:21:04,188
But unfortunately,
today's the 15th,

896
01:21:04,189 --> 01:21:07,258
and l have an appointment
at a palace in Paris

897
01:21:07,259 --> 01:21:09,059
to kill a president.

898
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,628
You're right,
it's the 15th,

899
01:21:11,629 --> 01:21:14,232
but you no longer have
an advantage on the others.

900
01:21:14,233 --> 01:21:16,567
ln fact,
you have a disadvantage.

901
01:21:16,568 --> 01:21:21,606
Your president
is not in the palace anymore.

902
01:21:21,607 --> 01:21:23,273
He's at
the Ferriere Castle,

903
01:21:23,274 --> 01:21:25,443
five miles outside
of Rambouillet,

904
01:21:25,444 --> 01:21:27,211
in Yvelines.

905
01:21:27,212 --> 01:21:33,184
By now they should be digging
pits, putting bags of sand up.

906
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:34,685
What is it?

907
01:21:34,686 --> 01:21:37,087
You seem surprised.

908
01:21:37,088 --> 01:21:39,758
Did you think they'd
give you an update?

909
01:21:39,759 --> 01:21:41,625
Are there many
of them down there?

910
01:21:41,626 --> 01:21:46,431
Well, the cops, special squads,
Rosen's bloodhounds,

911
01:21:46,432 --> 01:21:49,467
oh, and a pilot!

912
01:21:49,468 --> 01:21:51,935
A pilot?

913
01:21:51,936 --> 01:21:53,471
Yes, l think
they're planning to have

914
01:21:53,472 --> 01:21:56,174
Miss Doris Anderson
come there.

915
01:21:56,175 --> 01:21:57,508
Frederiksen.

916
01:21:57,509 --> 01:22:04,516
Right, to have Miss Frederiksen
come by helicopter.

917
01:22:04,517 --> 01:22:07,184
There you go,

918
01:22:07,185 --> 01:22:13,158
that's what we should have
started with, my dear Alice...

919
01:22:13,159 --> 01:22:16,650
the helicopter!

920
01:22:23,234 --> 01:22:29,474
l'm sure l'll hit him,
l'm positive!

921
01:22:29,475 --> 01:22:31,742
Where can he go?

922
01:22:31,743 --> 01:22:34,379
l'd know if he was
in the hotel.

923
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,798
l'd know if
he was at his wife's.

924
01:22:36,799 --> 01:22:38,925
He doesn't have
any friends left.

925
01:22:38,926 --> 01:22:41,051
Listen, you take care
of Beaumont,

926
01:22:41,052 --> 01:22:44,789
and l'll go keep an eye
on the President.

927
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:46,391
Farges and Valera
are there already,

928
01:22:46,392 --> 01:22:50,479
at the castle,
l'll join them.

929
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:54,565
Poor Valera,
l feel for him.

930
01:22:54,566 --> 01:22:56,935
Colonel, Miss Ancelin
is asking to be excused.

931
01:22:56,936 --> 01:22:59,003
She won't be able
to come in today.

932
01:22:59,004 --> 01:23:00,737
What's wrong with her?

933
01:23:00,738 --> 01:23:04,139
l don't know, she doesn't
feel well, she's tired.

934
01:23:07,779 --> 01:23:10,213
Overworked, maybe?

935
01:24:30,261 --> 01:24:32,229
Rosen.

936
01:24:39,771 --> 01:24:43,104
l told you l'd always
be right behind you.

937
01:25:13,905 --> 01:25:16,540
Excuse me, gentlemen.

938
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:21,546
Do you know where l can find
Dr. Touchard, please?

939
01:25:21,547 --> 01:25:27,974
l looked at the...
the apartment listings...

940
01:25:30,755 --> 01:25:34,782
l came to leave these.

941
01:25:38,229 --> 01:25:40,832
Well, l'll go to ask
at the front desk

942
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:43,096
for that information.

943
01:25:50,675 --> 01:25:52,404
Excuse me.

944
01:26:37,288 --> 01:26:39,890
No l.D.

945
01:26:39,891 --> 01:26:42,526
Hello, hello,
no l.D.

946
01:26:42,527 --> 01:26:46,881
Just dog tags under the name of
Commander Josselin Beaumont.

947
01:26:46,882 --> 01:26:51,235
The first reports say that the
officer was killed by a bullet.

948
01:26:51,236 --> 01:26:53,270
Oh, shit!

949
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:58,042
He was wearing dog tags
with the number 322460,

950
01:26:58,043 --> 01:27:02,813
registered under the name
of Josselin Beaumont.

951
01:27:02,814 --> 01:27:07,717
The first reports show that
he's been killed by a bullet.

952
01:27:12,056 --> 01:27:15,592
l don't understand how he could
fall into such a trap

953
01:27:15,593 --> 01:27:21,099
because a direct confrontation
is unthinkable... by a bullet.

954
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,535
l'd like to meet
whoever did that!

955
01:27:23,536 --> 01:27:25,570
ls that all it says
in the report?

956
01:27:25,571 --> 01:27:27,739
lt also says
that the body is at

957
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:30,108
The lnstitute
for Legal Medicine.

958
01:27:30,109 --> 01:27:32,476
By the way,
tell Colonel Martin

959
01:27:32,477 --> 01:27:34,579
that l won't go
to identify the body.

960
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:35,812
That's his business!

961
01:27:35,813 --> 01:27:37,348
He knows how l feel
about this.

962
01:27:37,349 --> 01:27:39,373
Calm down,
l'll tell him!

963
01:27:40,384 --> 01:27:46,591
We knew this would
go badly, didn't we?

964
01:27:46,592 --> 01:27:48,889
Why was he so stubborn?

965
01:27:54,599 --> 01:27:56,299
Okay, Farges, you're
off to Paris.

966
01:27:56,300 --> 01:28:00,838
Go to the morgue
to identify Beaumont's body.

967
01:28:00,839 --> 01:28:02,172
Yes, what is it?

968
01:28:02,173 --> 01:28:04,041
Your Excellency
would like to know

969
01:28:04,042 --> 01:28:05,909
if all the measures
have been taken

970
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:09,646
concerning the helicopter
for Miss Frederiksen?

971
01:28:09,647 --> 01:28:13,317
What the hell should l care
about his stupid whore?

972
01:28:13,318 --> 01:28:14,584
Yes, yes,
everything is ready.

973
01:28:14,585 --> 01:28:16,754
He just needs to whistle
and she'll land on the lawn.

974
01:28:16,755 --> 01:28:18,956
So, is that good enough,
Arthur?

975
01:28:18,957 --> 01:28:21,550
Yes, very well.

976
01:28:31,402 --> 01:28:35,138
lsn't all this going
a little too far?

977
01:28:35,139 --> 01:28:39,043
We'll send all these people
back to their normal posts.

978
01:28:39,044 --> 01:28:42,146
The regular service
is more than enough

979
01:28:42,147 --> 01:28:45,013
to protect this whorehouse.

980
01:28:53,057 --> 01:28:54,547
Oh, my god!

981
01:29:06,337 --> 01:29:07,637
Hello?

982
01:29:07,638 --> 01:29:10,441
Give me Colonel Martin,
immediately!

983
01:29:10,442 --> 01:29:13,043
Hello, Colonel?

984
01:29:13,044 --> 01:29:16,646
Hello, Farges,
hello, Farges?

985
01:29:16,647 --> 01:29:18,282
lt was me that you saw
laying on that table.

986
01:29:18,283 --> 01:29:21,218
Hello?

987
01:29:21,219 --> 01:29:27,041
Colonel... l did identify
Beaumont, it was him.

988
01:29:27,042 --> 01:29:32,864
What's up, Farges?
Your voice sounds funny.

989
01:29:32,865 --> 01:29:34,664
l liked Beaumont.

990
01:29:34,665 --> 01:29:36,300
Well good,
see you in a bit.

991
01:29:36,301 --> 01:29:38,359
Let's go!

992
01:29:46,544 --> 01:29:50,248
l didn't believe Rosen when
he told me he had hit Beaumont.

993
01:29:50,249 --> 01:29:53,885
He's a strange cop,
that Rosen,

994
01:29:53,886 --> 01:29:57,521
a real ass,
but what a cop!

995
01:29:57,522 --> 01:29:59,222
Meet me at the office.

996
01:29:59,223 --> 01:30:02,090
l'll give the good news
to his Excellency.

997
01:30:06,764 --> 01:30:10,301
What time will the helicopter
with the giri land?

998
01:30:10,302 --> 01:30:13,403
Three-thirty, why?

999
01:30:13,404 --> 01:30:17,207
Because we'll make plans
according to that.

1000
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:22,880
Relax, lnspector, relax,
isn't it nice to be driving?

1001
01:30:22,881 --> 01:30:26,784
Breath in,
it smells like springtime!

1002
01:30:26,785 --> 01:30:29,085
When we pass the gate,

1003
01:30:29,086 --> 01:30:31,155
try to look as natural
as you look dumb!

1004
01:30:31,156 --> 01:30:34,613
You hear me,
natural!

1005
01:30:41,632 --> 01:30:43,567
See that, the Colonel's
sending his men home.

1006
01:30:43,568 --> 01:30:45,125
The path is clear.

1007
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:52,676
Don't forget what
l told you, natural!

1008
01:30:52,677 --> 01:30:54,474
Now you're pushing it,
that's almost friendly.

1009
01:30:57,181 --> 01:30:58,944
Thank you!

1010
01:31:01,185 --> 01:31:04,321
Stop in front of
the entrance stairs.

1011
01:31:04,322 --> 01:31:07,457
Where are
the president's rooms?

1012
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:09,994
Do you want to end up
in a freezer like Rosen?

1013
01:31:09,995 --> 01:31:12,128
Where are Njala's apartments?

1014
01:31:12,129 --> 01:31:16,216
First fioor, opposite
the stairs, the large windows.

1015
01:31:16,217 --> 01:31:20,304
The helicopter, does it land
in front of it or behind?

1016
01:31:20,305 --> 01:31:21,669
There, on the grass.

1017
01:31:37,421 --> 01:31:38,911
Wait.

1018
01:31:42,893 --> 01:31:44,417
Hello.

1019
01:31:46,764 --> 01:31:48,789
What are
we gonna do now?

1020
01:32:13,858 --> 01:32:16,427
My respects, Colonel.

1021
01:32:16,428 --> 01:32:18,361
Beaumont.

1022
01:32:18,362 --> 01:32:20,765
So, who was it
at the morgue?

1023
01:32:20,766 --> 01:32:23,366
Rosen,
disappointed?

1024
01:32:23,367 --> 01:32:26,836
Rosen, yes,
very much so.

1025
01:32:26,837 --> 01:32:29,173
l was just saying
what a great cop he was.

1026
01:32:29,174 --> 01:32:31,775
Oh, but we're all
great guys.

1027
01:32:31,776 --> 01:32:33,889
Now, if you could just
hand me your weapon,

1028
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:36,002
with only two fingers,
just like on TV.

1029
01:32:41,419 --> 01:32:43,687
You don't know how much
pleasure it gives me

1030
01:32:43,688 --> 01:32:45,873
to see you in such
a picturesque palace

1031
01:32:45,874 --> 01:32:48,058
for this, the final act
of our drama.

1032
01:32:48,059 --> 01:32:53,564
lt was Njala who arranged it,
so we should go thank him.

1033
01:32:53,565 --> 01:32:55,054
Go ahead.

1034
01:33:10,481 --> 01:33:14,018
You can leave us now, Colonel,
you have other things to do.

1035
01:33:14,019 --> 01:33:15,820
Go listen to Farges'
explanations and excuses,

1036
01:33:15,821 --> 01:33:17,787
put your elite hitmen
on the roof.

1037
01:33:17,788 --> 01:33:21,625
ln other words, the usual
calm before the storm.

1038
01:33:21,626 --> 01:33:22,692
Tell the Minister,

1039
01:33:22,693 --> 01:33:26,030
as soon as all that shit
is in place.

1040
01:33:26,031 --> 01:33:27,330
Come in!

1041
01:33:27,331 --> 01:33:29,632
l would love to chat
a little longer,

1042
01:33:29,633 --> 01:33:31,934
but you never make
his Excellency wait.

1043
01:33:36,874 --> 01:33:41,579
Don't turn the light on and
above all don't speak, Arthur!

1044
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,376
l'm not Arthur.

1045
01:33:50,988 --> 01:33:53,791
How can l help you,
Commander Beaumont?

1046
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,594
Open the curtains,
turn on the light,

1047
01:33:56,595 --> 01:33:59,154
and die,
Mr. President.

1048
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:04,969
l can see the corner
of an office

1049
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:06,971
and make out a silhouette.

1050
01:34:06,972 --> 01:34:08,740
They just
turned a light on.

1051
01:34:08,741 --> 01:34:10,507
ls that a signal,
or what?

1052
01:34:10,508 --> 01:34:11,975
l'm sure the President
had the clever idea

1053
01:34:11,976 --> 01:34:14,145
to make the other idiot
stand in broad daylight,

1054
01:34:14,146 --> 01:34:16,739
so l can kill him
with one shot.

1055
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:21,951
Farges, you should know
if it's him.

1056
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:24,021
You just saw him at the morgue,
where he was dead.

1057
01:34:24,022 --> 01:34:25,622
l told you that
l had a gun pointed here.

1058
01:34:25,623 --> 01:34:28,025
Do you know how that feels
to have a gun right here?

1059
01:34:28,026 --> 01:34:30,427
That's not like invoices
or reports, or numbers.

1060
01:34:30,428 --> 01:34:32,362
lt's a gun!

1061
01:34:32,363 --> 01:34:36,733
The curtains are open,
can you see anything?

1062
01:34:36,734 --> 01:34:39,430
lf l see Beaumont's gun peeking
through the curtain, l'll shoot.

1063
01:34:45,643 --> 01:34:47,928
How much more
time do we have?

1064
01:34:47,929 --> 01:34:50,213
You, about ten minutes,
not more.

1065
01:34:50,214 --> 01:34:51,549
And quite frankly,
l don't see any reason

1066
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:53,150
why you
should live any longer!

1067
01:34:53,151 --> 01:34:55,485
My country needs me!

1068
01:34:55,486 --> 01:34:57,720
No country needs
a tyrant.

1069
01:34:57,721 --> 01:35:00,824
Word of your death will
trigger joy among your people.

1070
01:35:00,825 --> 01:35:02,492
They'll dance
in the streets.

1071
01:35:02,493 --> 01:35:06,197
They'll burn you in effigy under
the coconut tree of freedom.

1072
01:35:06,198 --> 01:35:08,831
There'll be no regrets.

1073
01:35:08,832 --> 01:35:13,003
l have one, the regret
of not having killed you.

1074
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:16,272
That l really regret!

1075
01:35:16,273 --> 01:35:18,576
l often ask myself
why l didn't do it.

1076
01:35:18,577 --> 01:35:21,544
Maybe for
religious reasons?

1077
01:35:21,545 --> 01:35:26,283
No, l think l saved you in order
to trade you in one day.

1078
01:35:26,284 --> 01:35:28,351
But for what?

1079
01:35:28,352 --> 01:35:31,104
You don't represent
any value to me.

1080
01:35:31,105 --> 01:35:33,857
That's exactly what
misled you thus far,

1081
01:35:33,858 --> 01:35:35,758
your system of values--

1082
01:35:35,759 --> 01:35:38,562
the good, the bad,
the kind, the evil--

1083
01:35:38,563 --> 01:35:41,365
in short,
the general concept of values.

1084
01:35:41,366 --> 01:35:43,466
Here we are,

1085
01:35:43,467 --> 01:35:47,037
and we're heading toward
the most simple solution.

1086
01:35:47,038 --> 01:35:50,608
Unfortunately, for you,
it's the final solution.

1087
01:35:50,609 --> 01:35:54,612
So, what are you
waiting for?

1088
01:35:54,613 --> 01:35:56,773
The helicopter.

1089
01:36:16,233 --> 01:36:18,334
l'm not asking you
to take a message!

1090
01:36:18,335 --> 01:36:20,704
l'm asking you to put
the Minister on the phone!

1091
01:36:20,705 --> 01:36:22,763
Let me speak to
the Minister, Miss!

1092
01:36:24,541 --> 01:36:26,576
You're something else!

1093
01:36:26,577 --> 01:36:29,446
lt took you French three
revolutions and five republics

1094
01:36:29,447 --> 01:36:33,434
to achieve some semblance
of democracy,

1095
01:36:33,435 --> 01:36:37,421
and you want me
to achieve it in one day!

1096
01:36:37,422 --> 01:36:39,856
l don't care.

1097
01:36:39,857 --> 01:36:41,491
l don't want to hear
all this chatter

1098
01:36:41,492 --> 01:36:43,627
about ethics, morals
and comparative history.

1099
01:36:43,628 --> 01:36:45,151
l don't give a shit.

1100
01:36:49,433 --> 01:36:50,800
You see?

1101
01:36:50,801 --> 01:36:53,971
Even your cleverness
won't save you now!

1102
01:36:53,972 --> 01:36:55,802
Call them!

1103
01:37:04,415 --> 01:37:06,049
What's going on?

1104
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:07,484
l don't know,
l don't understand,

1105
01:37:07,485 --> 01:37:08,852
something's going on.

1106
01:37:08,853 --> 01:37:09,819
Yes.

1107
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:11,583
Captain,
it's President Njala.

1108
01:37:14,758 --> 01:37:15,992
Hello?

1109
01:37:15,993 --> 01:37:17,994
When we come out, we don't
want to see anybody,

1110
01:37:17,995 --> 01:37:22,700
not on the stairs, not in
the hall, not on the lawns.

1111
01:37:22,701 --> 01:37:24,735
And the helicopter has to be
ready to leave.

1112
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:27,071
And the helicopter
ready to go.

1113
01:37:27,072 --> 01:37:28,738
Give me Beaumont.

1114
01:37:28,739 --> 01:37:31,071
He wants
to talk to you.

1115
01:37:34,545 --> 01:37:35,678
Hello?

1116
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,780
Hello, Joss.

1117
01:37:37,781 --> 01:37:40,017
We may never
see each other again.

1118
01:37:40,018 --> 01:37:41,584
Why not?

1119
01:37:41,585 --> 01:37:43,886
lnvite me over,
it's always a great time.

1120
01:37:43,887 --> 01:37:47,057
ls there anything l could say
to make you change your mind?

1121
01:37:47,058 --> 01:37:48,991
l can't think of anything,

1122
01:37:48,992 --> 01:37:51,552
but l'll give it a thought,
l promise.

1123
01:37:52,296 --> 01:37:54,498
Go ahead,
let's get it over with.

1124
01:37:54,499 --> 01:37:56,666
Get it over with?

1125
01:37:56,667 --> 01:38:00,170
Okay, but l never intended
to kill you.

1126
01:38:00,171 --> 01:38:03,674
Oh, really, so what's
that in your hand?

1127
01:38:03,675 --> 01:38:06,438
This, it's empty,
Mr. President.

1128
01:38:14,017 --> 01:38:16,212
l can see his gun.

1129
01:38:18,222 --> 01:38:20,718
l don't understand
anything anymore!

1130
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:23,215
You will very soon,
Mr. President.

1131
01:38:28,198 --> 01:38:30,133
l got him!

1132
01:38:30,134 --> 01:38:31,881
l'm telling you,
l got him!

1133
01:38:31,882 --> 01:38:33,629
One second,
Mr. Minister.

1134
01:38:50,687 --> 01:38:52,917
No one moves, wait
for further instructions.

1135
01:39:01,031 --> 01:39:04,000
Hello, Minister?

1136
01:39:04,001 --> 01:39:07,721
President Njala is dead.

1137
01:39:07,722 --> 01:39:11,441
No, lnspector Farges.

1138
01:39:11,442 --> 01:39:17,781
No, no, it's not a mistake,
it's some sort of a scheme.

1139
01:39:17,782 --> 01:39:20,875
Everyone stay put
and wait for my instructions!

1140
01:39:25,689 --> 01:39:27,741
Are we being tapped?

1141
01:39:27,742 --> 01:39:29,793
Of course, Minister!

1142
01:39:29,794 --> 01:39:32,428
Don't shoot!

1143
01:39:32,429 --> 01:39:35,766
No one moves without
an order to do so!

1144
01:39:35,767 --> 01:39:38,468
l am waiting
for your order.

1145
01:39:38,469 --> 01:39:42,840
There's a helicopter
ready for takeoff,

1146
01:39:42,841 --> 01:39:44,740
and Beaumont is going
to take it.

1147
01:39:50,447 --> 01:39:54,383
Of course,
so what should l do?

1148
01:39:54,384 --> 01:39:56,854
Colonel, do whatever
you think is necessary.

1149
01:39:56,855 --> 01:39:58,922
l don't know
anymore, sir!

1150
01:39:58,923 --> 01:40:00,623
l'm out of it now.

1151
01:40:00,624 --> 01:40:03,193
My resignation will be on
your desk before six o'clock.

1152
01:40:03,194 --> 01:40:05,362
So, what are you going to do,
Mr. Minister?

1153
01:40:05,363 --> 01:40:06,729
What can be done?

1154
01:40:06,730 --> 01:40:08,465
Well, we can kill him
or let him leave,

1155
01:40:08,466 --> 01:40:10,126
but that's up to you, now.

1156
01:40:13,904 --> 01:40:15,305
What's going on here?

1157
01:40:15,306 --> 01:40:17,775
Rosen is dead.

1158
01:40:17,776 --> 01:40:20,243
Njala is dead.

1159
01:40:20,244 --> 01:40:23,145
And they're deciding my fate
as we speak.

1160
01:40:28,819 --> 01:40:30,287
Come to Paris with me.

1161
01:40:30,288 --> 01:40:31,587
No.

1162
01:40:31,588 --> 01:40:34,022
But if l were you, l wouldn't
stay in the line of fire.

1163
01:40:39,029 --> 01:40:42,082
Minister, we only
have a few seconds.

1164
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:45,135
Well, there's
a criminal aspect to it,

1165
01:40:45,136 --> 01:40:47,036
but also
the political aspect,

1166
01:40:47,037 --> 01:40:49,806
especially after the comments
that Beaumont made to the press.

1167
01:40:49,807 --> 01:40:51,398
Well, shit,
what am l gonna do?

1168
01:41:04,788 --> 01:41:06,406
We have to stop him!

1169
01:41:06,407 --> 01:41:08,024
ls that an order?

1170
01:41:08,025 --> 01:41:11,477
l'm ordering
you to stop him!

1171
01:41:11,478 --> 01:41:14,930
Farges,
we have to stop him!
