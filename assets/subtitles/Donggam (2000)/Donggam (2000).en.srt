1
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:17,659
- Soeun!
- Yes?

2
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:22,862
- Is Sunmi hospitalized?
- Yes, just been there

3
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:24,904
Is she alright?

4
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:27,037
She broke her leg

5
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:32,409
She has to stay there for 2 weeks

6
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:36,048
Must have been some bicycle trick

7
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:40,145
How did you find out so soon?

8
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:47,022
Well... I was on the back seat

9
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:30,967
Is everything OK?

10
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,923
4 minutes 58 seconds!

11
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:55,194
Wait, wait a minute, a new record!

12
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:59,960
A Women's touch
beat the men's superiority!

13
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:06,476
Hey, just a moment
something's wrong...

14
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,044
A transistor is missing

15
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:15,243
How am I supposed to assemble
the damn thing?

16
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:16,680
Who gave me this?

17
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,481
Common, give it up. Accept it!

18
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:24,090
No excuses. Take it like a man!

19
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:27,196
You lose and game's over

20
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:31,992
Drinks on you

21
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,437
Anyway

22
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:44,543
this is all I have

23
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:47,078
Gotta run!

24
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:51,518
C'mon, wait!

25
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:38,729
Excuse me...

26
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:43,996
Soeun?

27
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,639
Soeun!

28
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:56,310
Oh! Donghee...ls that you?

29
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:58,248
Yes, I've returned

30
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:00,319
I see...

31
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,628
What's this?

32
00:06:06,597 --> 00:06:11,967
Yeah, it's my hobby

33
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,564
You're a HAM? Surprising...

34
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:19,171
I like it

35
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:25,909
I see...OK then, see you later

36
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:35,984
By the way,

37
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:39,960
thanks for the letters you sent
while I was in the Army

38
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:44,731
You've sent so many

39
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:46,399
Bye now

40
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:47,918
I just wanted to take a look

41
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:49,658
I'm sorry

42
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:58,062
- Do you smell alcohol on my breath?
- Yes, a little...

43
00:08:58,435 --> 00:09:00,960
It's all because of
that piece of junk

44
00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:03,330
I also had to pay for the drinks

45
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:05,504
It's old and broken

46
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:10,608
Can't even find the parts

47
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:13,077
Take it!

48
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:16,149
When it's besides you,

49
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:20,086
you'll have many drinking days

50
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:26,990
Thank you. Donghee!

51
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:29,657
Oh! Soeun

52
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:33,469
You're really into it

53
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:34,862
Is it yours?

54
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:37,001
- What?
- That!

55
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:40,141
- Yes
- Is it yours?

56
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:44,938
- It's mine, alright?
- What?

57
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,915
- Yeah, sure...
- Yes, it's mine

58
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:53,188
- It's lots of fun
- Really?

59
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:56,358
- Goodbye
- Bye

60
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:22,107
You alright?

61
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:35,962
Hey, take it easy!

62
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,357
Might hurt yourself waving

63
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,201
So?

64
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:50,035
What's so great about him
talking to you?

65
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:52,111
So weird

66
00:10:52,382 --> 00:10:56,978
Couldn't breathe and blood
gushing to my head

67
00:10:57,254 --> 00:11:06,424
When he calls my name.
Soeun...Soeun...

68
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:10,228
My name sounds so pretty

69
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:14,160
Soeun...Soeun...

70
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:17,907
Soeun...

71
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:23,010
I'll get another bed here.
You're sicker than me

72
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,638
You have no idea...

73
00:11:25,882 --> 00:11:30,114
When he looks at me,
he looks at my eyes

74
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,920
Left and right

75
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:38,953
One at a time.
He could look elsewhere but...

76
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,654
..always the same

77
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:47,462
Left eye and right eye

78
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:50,130
Then where do you look?

79
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:53,934
Me? Don't remember

80
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:57,578
Anyway,
I feel like my heart might burst...

81
00:11:57,848 --> 00:12:05,050
and every muscle in my body twitches

82
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:08,457
Is this love?

83
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:12,792
I know how you feel
but I don't think that's love

84
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:16,959
You've felt it before?

85
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:22,763
It felt like my heart would burst...

86
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,440
and every muscle
in my body twitched

87
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:30,913
You came to me when I fell and said

88
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:32,842
Sunmi, you alright?

89
00:12:33,183 --> 00:12:37,745
You were looking at my eyes
one at a time

90
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:43,625
Then... Oh my God!
I must be in love with you

91
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,156
You!

92
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:54,297
Sungsu Bridge is now open
to the public

93
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:59,735
President Park participated
in the opening ceremony...

94
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:06,881
and discussed
the environmental effects

95
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,209
There'll be a lunar eclipse tonight.
Should we watch?

96
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:17,820
Sunmi's in the hospital?

97
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,220
Calling CQ, CQ, CQ.
This is DS1 AVO

98
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:58,291
Delta Sierra One Alpha Victor Oscar
Anyone copy?

99
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:02,562
Calling CQ, CQ, CQ.
This is DS1 AVO

100
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:07,064
Delta Sierra One Alpha Victor Oscar
Anyone copy?

101
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:11,997
Calling CQ, CQ, CQ.
This is DS1 AVO

102
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:16,138
Delta Sierra One Alpha Victor Oscar
Anyone copy?

103
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:25,514
Hello?
What did you say?

104
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:42,497
Oh, Sunmi! You scared me

105
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:46,405
No, I was just doing something

106
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:50,177
Where are you?

107
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:54,447
Right, in the hospital

108
00:15:55,852 --> 00:16:00,653
What? You're crazy to come out

109
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,222
What's so great about the eclipse?

110
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:10,929
Tomorrow? OK, I'll stop by

111
00:16:12,502 --> 00:16:14,197
Hello?

112
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:21,629
Soeun!

113
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:23,663
Yes?

114
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:27,636
- Are you busy today?
- Not really

115
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:30,712
You want to see a play?

116
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:32,980
A play?

117
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,848
I'm not really into plays
but a friend of mine directed it

118
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:39,687
He'd kill me if I didn't show up

119
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,684
So he just wants me to
show my face...

120
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,652
but I didn't want to go alone

121
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:48,826
- So if you like plays...
- Yes, I like them!

122
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,796
What is the title?

123
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:59,403
Well...it was too long to remember

124
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:01,644
Let's find out when we get there

125
00:18:01,878 --> 00:18:05,211
- Anyway, 7 o'clock, OK?
- Yes

126
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:06,938
OK, then...

127
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:12,319
Oh! Donghee!

128
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,255
What?

129
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,729
I forgot. I have an engagement

130
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,360
Oh, yeah?

131
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:29,497
What can you do?
It's my fault anyway

132
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:36,805
Asking for a date
at the last minute doesn't work

133
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:42,617
I guess last minute things
only work with Rugby

134
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:49,952
- OK, I'm leaving then
- Yeah...

135
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,987
Then...

136
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,962
What's with the long face?
What's wrong?

137
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,940
Nothing...Do your parents know
you're going out?

138
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:15,645
Don't worry
I'll tell them you talked me into it

139
00:19:16,386 --> 00:19:19,549
Where do you wanna go
with that broken leg?

140
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:22,848
Remember my friend Miyoon?
Her boyfriend directed a play

141
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:29,790
I promised her I would go

142
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,262
Play? What's the title?

143
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:39,372
Title? Let me see... I forgot

144
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:43,035
Too long to remember anyway

145
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:50,279
Our life has so many turns,
so let's leave when there's applause

146
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,113
You came!

147
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:25,445
- And?
- My friend, Sunmi

148
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:27,121
- How do you do?
- Hi...

149
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,322
Have a seat

150
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:46,368
You'd better go now.
Are you gonna be alright?

151
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:52,268
Yes. Need a little exercise.
Nice meeting you

152
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:56,667
Are you sure?
You'd have to go up the stairs?

153
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:59,005
Don't worry. Bye

154
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,222
Let's go

155
00:22:10,026 --> 00:22:11,926
Do you go right to sleep?

156
00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:16,996
Not right away. Wash my face, read...

157
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:23,303
- What about HAM radio?
- What? Yes, sometimes

158
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:27,203
- You have to teach me someday
- Sorry?

159
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:31,676
Sure, someday...

160
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,024
Hello?

161
00:22:44,427 --> 00:22:47,863
Thanks for responding.
I'll introduce this OP

162
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:50,156
QRA is DS1 AVO

163
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:52,765
QTH is Kangnamku Chungdamdong

164
00:22:53,035 --> 00:22:55,503
Attending Shilla University

165
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:59,832
My name is JEE as in Jesus
IN as in in-and-out. JEE, IN

166
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:02,268
Signal 59 receiving you
loud and clear

167
00:23:02,578 --> 00:23:06,241
Turning it over to you. DS1 AVO

168
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,517
Hello?

169
00:23:09,786 --> 00:23:12,880
Contacted! Are you a novice?

170
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:16,615
What I mean is...
Have you ever tried this before?

171
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:20,095
No...

172
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,463
I see...understandable...

173
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:26,792
But once you get used to it,
it's easier than chatting

174
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:29,663
I'm Jee In. How do you do?

175
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:36,670
Hi, Mr. Ahm Jeein
my name's Yoon, Soeun

176
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:42,581
Not Ahm Jeein, Jee, In.
IN is my first name

177
00:23:43,486 --> 00:23:49,447
Oh, I'm sorry.
Have you been doing this a long time?

178
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,788
Only a few years

179
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:57,065
You'll get used to it.
It's more fun than you think

180
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:01,931
I have to learn. Would you teach me?

181
00:24:02,605 --> 00:24:04,368
Of course!

182
00:24:04,674 --> 00:24:08,542
I've got a book for beginners
I'll let you borrow it

183
00:24:08,778 --> 00:24:12,077
I go to Shilla University.
Are you a student?

184
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:16,578
Oh! I go to the same school!

185
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:21,255
Wow! What a coincidence!

186
00:24:21,724 --> 00:24:24,318
How come you didn't join the HAM club?

187
00:24:25,695 --> 00:24:30,189
What? Oh, I just- -...

188
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:36,004
I see, trying it all by yourself, huh?

189
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:42,203
Interesting. I'll give you the book
at school tomorrow

190
00:24:43,713 --> 00:24:44,941
Tomorrow?

191
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:51,810
- Sorry, I must be rushing you
- No, it's not that...

192
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:54,656
- I really appreciate it
- OK, then

193
00:24:55,391 --> 00:24:57,416
Where should we meet?

194
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,820
How about the Clock Tower?
In front of the main building

195
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:05,157
- The one they are building?
- Pardon?

196
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:08,595
OK. We'll meet at 2p. m.

197
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:11,939
See you then.
I'll give the final call

198
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,301
Thank you

199
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,477
Down with dictatorship!

200
00:26:59,015 --> 00:27:03,111
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

201
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,249
Am I standing in front of
the main building?

202
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:08,248
What are you talking about?

203
00:27:08,924 --> 00:27:14,760
- Is that the main building behind me?
- Of course!

204
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:17,822
This is the Clock Tower, right?

205
00:27:18,234 --> 00:27:22,500
Are you mad? Of course it is!

206
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:28,768
OK. Then, go

207
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:37,680
One more thing.
Is this Shilla University?

208
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:45,593
You were actually waiting for me,
weren't you?

209
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:51,458
You wanted to get my sympathy
by looking like that...

210
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:58,366
and become like a hero in a movie

211
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:02,608
Yeah, I was actually waiting for you

212
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,115
I came to this school to meet you
and the purpose of my birth is you

213
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:10,611
My family motto is Love Hyunji

214
00:28:10,986 --> 00:28:18,518
I have your name tattooed
on my back. Satisfied?

215
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:22,286
But I think it's odd to wait for
a stranger for 2 hours in the rain?

216
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:28,434
I've never seen her.
So I waited for her

217
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:34,436
Frankly, I wouldn't wait for you.
Understand?

218
00:28:37,913 --> 00:28:39,107
Bastard!

219
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:40,706
What?

220
00:28:43,753 --> 00:28:44,879
Hello?

221
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:11,669
- Go home and get some rest
- I'm going

222
00:29:11,914 --> 00:29:14,815
- Home?
- You don't have to know

223
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:18,986
- Why not?
- It's none of your business

224
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,221
Hey, leave me the umbrella

225
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:51,207
How come you didn't show up?

226
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:57,476
Well, I could understand

227
00:30:58,654 --> 00:31:01,418
If you are not in college.
It's not a big deal to be in college

228
00:31:01,757 --> 00:31:04,920
You don't have to have a complex

229
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:09,462
I could understand if you're not
very good looking

230
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:13,494
When you saw
a good looking guy like me

231
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:18,503
you didn't have the guts to face me

232
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:28,943
What are you talking about?

233
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:33,187
I was waiting for you for over
2 hours getting dust all over me

234
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,019
Dust?

235
00:31:38,661 --> 00:31:43,655
You mean, dust in the rain?

236
00:31:44,967 --> 00:31:48,061
Rain? What rain?

237
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:51,396
What are you talking about?
It's bright and sunny

238
00:31:53,943 --> 00:31:55,342
Really?

239
00:31:56,078 --> 00:32:02,711
Are you sure you're in Korea?
Not Japan or China?

240
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:07,448
Wait a minute!

241
00:32:15,164 --> 00:32:17,894
45a. Can't you hear the sound?

242
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:22,192
It's been raining for days.
Are you saying I'm crazy?

243
00:32:33,582 --> 00:32:39,680
Stop pulling my leg
and turn off the shower!

244
00:32:55,838 --> 00:32:57,703
What the f...!

245
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Calling CQ, CQ, CQ...
This is DS1 AVO

246
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:40,111
Delta Sierra One Alpha Victor Oscar
Anyone copy?

247
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:43,877
That's bullshit!

248
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:49,120
Even soldiers don't fight
if they're not fed

249
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:52,589
And you did what
with a disconnected HAM radio?

250
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:54,524
It doesn't make sense, right?

251
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:56,524
Then something's wrong
with the radio?

252
00:33:56,698 --> 00:33:58,996
No, something's wrong with you!

253
00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:00,092
What's up?

254
00:34:00,469 --> 00:34:03,666
He's gone mad.
I think he's been struck by lightning

255
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:05,938
Then he should be back to normal

256
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:09,836
- He was a strange one
- You're right

257
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:14,648
Right,
I wish I was struck by lightning

258
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:35,001
What are you doing?

259
00:34:35,504 --> 00:34:37,870
Fixing something

260
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,868
Why do you need both of you
to fix it?

261
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:48,073
Sir, why don't you take her?
She's bothering me

262
00:34:48,317 --> 00:34:51,252
Why are you bothering him?

263
00:34:51,487 --> 00:34:54,547
Go home.
It's not the place for a girl

264
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,658
Is this a boys' dorm or something?

265
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:02,359
Hyunji, my friend. Get lost!

266
00:35:02,798 --> 00:35:06,529
Frankly, I can't even
find a hole because of you!

267
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:24,748
Isn't that a simple machine?
You just talk and listen

268
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:42,433
- I've been waiting for you
- I just got home

269
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:50,369
- I see, got home late
- Why, did you wait for me?

270
00:35:50,646 --> 00:35:53,342
I don't think we have anything
to talk about

271
00:35:55,117 --> 00:36:00,578
Well...I just wanna apologize...
I was rude

272
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,818
Guess it's raining still?

273
00:36:05,527 --> 00:36:08,587
Not today

274
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:13,026
So, what grade are you in?

275
00:36:14,436 --> 00:36:16,097
A junior

276
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:20,438
Oh, you're older...
I'm a sophomore

277
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:27,042
Wait!
Then should I call you older sister?

278
00:36:28,217 --> 00:36:33,553
No, you don't have to do that.
I don't want a little brother like you

279
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:37,382
We should be the same age
since I went to school a year early

280
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:40,059
Came to school in 77

281
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:43,254
Oh, I see

282
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:49,293
- What year did you say?
- Yes? Why?

283
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:54,139
I thought I heard it wrong

284
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:59,306
77. Did you hear it right this time?

285
00:37:02,918 --> 00:37:07,287
No, I heard it wrong again.
Just a minute, you mean...

286
00:37:07,856 --> 00:37:14,091
when you say 77,
does it mean the year 1977?

287
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:21,494
We usually say 77 short for 1977

288
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:29,168
If you're joking, it's not funny

289
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:31,409
What?

290
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:33,971
What I mean is

291
00:37:34,316 --> 00:37:36,113
you sound so sincere

292
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:39,146
How do you do that?

293
00:37:40,188 --> 00:37:44,181
We are the same age
and go to the same school...

294
00:37:44,726 --> 00:37:47,194
but I came to school in 77

295
00:37:47,496 --> 00:37:51,227
Short for 1977

296
00:37:53,669 --> 00:38:00,404
So, you came in 1999 and now you
attend school in the year 2000?

297
00:38:01,276 --> 00:38:04,177
Last time I checked.

298
00:38:04,746 --> 00:38:09,183
If you're right, you're talking to me
after the end of the world

299
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,825
Finished?

300
00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:23,592
What year is this?

301
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:27,096
What? What the hell's wrong?

302
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:31,668
I'm going. Are you going?

303
00:38:32,174 --> 00:38:33,198
What?

304
00:38:53,428 --> 00:38:57,922
So... You were flirting with
someone old?

305
00:38:59,301 --> 00:39:03,863
You pervert, or maybe she is

306
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:08,337
She entered school in 1977.
But she's still in school

307
00:39:08,643 --> 00:39:15,742
I don't think she's neither kidding
nor crazy

308
00:39:20,322 --> 00:39:22,256
Hey, that's simple

309
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:30,063
She got into school in 1977
and she's now a junior

310
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,828
Yeah, she had some time off,
maybe for 20 years?

311
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:42,842
Maybe she was in the Army
for a long time...

312
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:50,879
or got married and had babies

313
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:58,986
Why are you here?
Your bus doesn't stop here

314
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:05,092
It's too late for the bus.
We'll take a cab

315
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,627
I'll drop you off

316
00:41:40,295 --> 00:41:41,887
Donghee!

317
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:44,794
Oh, Soeun

318
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:50,626
Have a seat here

319
00:41:51,573 --> 00:41:54,667
What are your plans after graduation?

320
00:41:56,311 --> 00:42:00,077
Such serious subject over lunch

321
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:06,248
Well...maybe office worker? Or...

322
00:42:06,521 --> 00:42:11,015
A politician? A congressman?

323
00:42:11,293 --> 00:42:17,664
I'm interested in politics but
you never know

324
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:23,832
Who knows? I may just play around
before the world ends?

325
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,572
- It won't end
- What?

326
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:29,776
You know they say
the world will end in 1999

327
00:42:30,078 --> 00:42:31,568
But it won't

328
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:36,013
How do you know?

329
00:42:36,518 --> 00:42:43,822
Well, isn't it a happy thought
anyhow?

330
00:42:44,793 --> 00:42:45,919
I see...

331
00:42:49,464 --> 00:42:51,625
Don't you like this? I'll eat it

332
00:43:13,555 --> 00:43:17,787
No wonder I couldn't find you

333
00:43:18,093 --> 00:43:21,256
Who'd think you'd be in the library?

334
00:43:21,496 --> 00:43:24,397
What do you want?

335
00:43:25,634 --> 00:43:29,934
A letter from your parents in America

336
00:43:30,872 --> 00:43:33,602
What are you doing with my letter?

337
00:43:35,443 --> 00:43:42,007
You never open your mailbox.
You should thank me

338
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:44,182
OK.

339
00:43:46,721 --> 00:43:54,093
By the way, how do I checkout books?
I've never done it

340
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:58,660
I knew it. Wait here

341
00:44:05,173 --> 00:44:06,037
Ma'am!

342
00:44:06,341 --> 00:44:11,973
What's the procedure for checking
out books?

343
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,107
Fill out the form
and I need student I.D.

344
00:44:16,418 --> 00:44:20,946
Student I.D.? No one carries that

345
00:44:21,656 --> 00:44:26,093
How about a driver's license?

346
00:44:47,515 --> 00:44:49,244
Don't you have class?

347
00:44:50,151 --> 00:44:52,745
We have the same classes

348
00:44:53,021 --> 00:44:55,785
When you don't have one,
I don't have one

349
00:44:56,091 --> 00:44:58,821
Stop annoying me

350
00:45:00,261 --> 00:45:03,230
Annoying? Bastard!

351
00:45:03,531 --> 00:45:07,524
I'm not a humanist. I don't have
time to annoy assholes like you

352
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:14,698
Here. Read it

353
00:45:14,976 --> 00:45:19,709
Damn it. Why are you telling me
to read my letter?

354
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:28,084
You read it.
I'm sure it's nothing

355
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:31,490
Do you really want me to read it?

356
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:44,902
- Oh my god!
- What?

357
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,538
What handwriting!

358
00:45:48,843 --> 00:45:54,008
She writes like a young person.
Meticulous and pretty

359
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:01,749
Just read it. Ask me if you run into
a difficult word

360
00:46:10,899 --> 00:46:17,498
So complicated. So many things
happened in October, 1979

361
00:46:17,972 --> 00:46:23,933
So complicated.
The house, weather, Dad

362
00:46:25,313 --> 00:46:28,441
Anyway, she wants you to write often

363
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,708
PS. You didn't forget mom's birthday?

364
00:46:33,188 --> 00:46:35,782
What's the date today?

365
00:46:35,957 --> 00:46:41,020
Today? 5th, why?

366
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:43,691
Forgot to send her present!

367
00:47:00,782 --> 00:47:02,773
Hey, are you making fun of me?

368
00:47:03,351 --> 00:47:05,376
Wear it when you get better

369
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:11,716
You'll get better quicker to wear it

370
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,652
Thanks, my friend

371
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:17,594
I should have gotten you
a short skirt

372
00:47:17,899 --> 00:47:20,663
So you won't ride a bicycle

373
00:47:24,439 --> 00:47:25,633
Leaving so soon?

374
00:47:25,874 --> 00:47:29,401
Sorry. Let's celebrate
when you get better

375
00:47:30,278 --> 00:47:34,339
You're really blinded by love,
aren't you?

376
00:47:34,616 --> 00:47:38,313
- Go, fly to your love
- I'm flying

377
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,990
Sorry to make you wait

378
00:47:48,196 --> 00:47:51,290
You didn't have to come out
so quickly

379
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:53,798
- It's OK. Let's go
- OK

380
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:01,436
Oh, Lord!

381
00:49:47,281 --> 00:49:49,249
I was saying...

382
00:49:50,184 --> 00:49:56,487
In Year 2000, do you think
people still talk at night?

383
00:49:57,558 --> 00:50:03,121
As long as there's night,
people will still talk at night

384
00:50:08,036 --> 00:50:10,834
It's late. I have to go

385
00:50:11,506 --> 00:50:13,497
Are your parents strict?

386
00:50:13,741 --> 00:50:17,837
No, but I have to jump over
the wall if it's too late

387
00:50:21,716 --> 00:50:25,777
How can a wall come between us?

388
00:50:33,428 --> 00:50:37,831
It was a line from the movie we saw

389
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,131
Oh, I see...

390
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:48,741
Have to go.
Gotta make it before the curfew

391
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:22,769
Your face...tiny

392
00:51:57,979 --> 00:52:02,882
Calling CQ, CQ, CQ...

393
00:52:03,184 --> 00:52:08,417
Yes, you're in 1979
and I'm in 2000

394
00:52:09,223 --> 00:52:13,751
And one of us is being very silly

395
00:52:14,495 --> 00:52:18,898
Or one of us is seriously crazy

396
00:52:21,068 --> 00:52:25,164
Let me ask you one thing

397
00:52:25,506 --> 00:52:28,475
Do you recall anything
on the news from yesterday?

398
00:52:34,148 --> 00:52:38,244
I don't even know
why we're talking in the first place

399
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:48,861
But sure... Youngsam Kim was
expelled from the National Assembly

400
00:52:49,297 --> 00:52:53,165
Student demonstrations are
everywhere

401
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:59,634
Do you have a 1979 archive
or something?

402
00:53:00,074 --> 00:53:01,234
What?

403
00:53:04,545 --> 00:53:07,912
No. Nothing

404
00:53:09,383 --> 00:53:17,984
Does it say that the expelled person
would be a president 14 years later?

405
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,520
What the hell are you talking about?

406
00:53:22,363 --> 00:53:23,887
Soeun, listen

407
00:53:25,466 --> 00:53:31,462
In this world, there are many
unexplainable incidents

408
00:53:31,973 --> 00:53:38,435
Those always...come on TV

409
00:53:39,113 --> 00:53:45,609
I thought they were made up

410
00:53:45,953 --> 00:53:49,320
If you keep talking nonsense,
let's stop

411
00:53:50,324 --> 00:53:52,519
I know it must be nonsense to you.
So we couldn't go on

412
00:53:52,793 --> 00:53:54,852
But listen carefully!

413
00:53:55,162 --> 00:53:59,997
You're a junior in 1979 and...

414
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:05,361
I'm a sophomore and
my calendar says it's Year 2000

415
00:54:05,673 --> 00:54:10,372
It's your news for tomorrow

416
00:54:11,445 --> 00:54:15,882
Pusan will be
placed under martial law

417
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:25,625
At school, a completion ceremony for
the clock tower will be held

418
00:54:25,926 --> 00:54:33,697
But it'll be postponed.
The Dean will have a heart attack

419
00:54:34,035 --> 00:54:35,297
What?

420
00:54:36,537 --> 00:54:38,061
Ah...you must respect the Dean

421
00:54:38,272 --> 00:54:42,868
But don't worry. He'll be back
next month for the ceremony

422
00:54:43,144 --> 00:54:45,704
Oh, yeah?
Don't you have any other news?

423
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:49,347
Like a mermaid found in the river
or an earthquake in Seoul

424
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,847
How about the death of the President?

425
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:57,090
The President will die
on the 26th of this month

426
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:00,418
But no mermaid nor an earthquake

427
00:55:02,563 --> 00:55:11,335
OK, I'm not asking you to believe me.
We'll talk tomorrow

428
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:16,437
Sure. Let's stop.
It's the Curfew time already

429
00:55:17,778 --> 00:55:19,973
The Curfew...

430
00:55:22,717 --> 00:55:24,776
Jesus!

431
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:50,075
PUSAN UNDER MATIAL LAW

432
00:56:03,591 --> 00:56:05,616
The completion ceremony for
the clock tower will be postponed...

433
00:56:24,745 --> 00:56:26,076
Hello?

434
00:56:26,313 --> 00:56:30,215
Hey, you responded right away.
In a hurry?

435
00:56:31,318 --> 00:56:34,879
Who are you? What's going on?

436
00:56:35,656 --> 00:56:39,422
It's simple. I live in 2000

437
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:46,427
I can find information
about 1979 just like that

438
00:56:50,271 --> 00:56:57,234
Does that mean you believe
that I live in 1979?

439
00:56:58,379 --> 00:57:02,372
I have no choice

440
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:08,611
Then it's my turn to believe

441
00:57:09,857 --> 00:57:13,793
You probably have no choice

442
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:34,642
Donghee...

443
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:38,714
What's up?

444
00:57:39,053 --> 00:57:42,887
Waiting for you.
Are you free this afternoon?

445
00:57:46,694 --> 00:57:50,221
Gee, I've got something on

446
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,264
Would it finish late?

447
00:57:55,536 --> 00:57:57,731
Anything wrong?

448
00:57:58,005 --> 00:58:00,769
No, I just...

449
00:58:01,775 --> 00:58:06,178
I don't mean to refuse
a surprise date offer

450
00:58:06,847 --> 00:58:08,405
It's OK.

451
00:58:09,183 --> 00:58:10,309
Going home?

452
00:58:10,684 --> 00:58:14,347
No, I have to stop by the hospital

453
00:58:14,622 --> 00:58:18,023
Oh, the broken leg!
She's funny

454
00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:20,557
Yes, she's nice and pretty

455
00:58:22,696 --> 00:58:24,789
Gotta go

456
00:58:25,099 --> 00:58:27,192
- OK
- Bye

457
00:58:28,903 --> 00:58:31,098
Let's go

458
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:42,410
So a guy from Year 2000
is making a pass at you?

459
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:49,383
No, I don't think he's a bad guy

460
00:58:50,357 --> 00:58:55,522
See? You're already falling for him

461
00:58:55,796 --> 00:58:57,423
Falling for who?

462
00:59:00,301 --> 00:59:07,639
You're already falling for someone
whom you've never met

463
00:59:08,776 --> 00:59:12,212
He must be a con artist.
Call the police

464
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,547
He's trying to get to your soft side...

465
00:59:14,848 --> 00:59:20,616
by lying about Year 2000

466
00:59:22,556 --> 00:59:24,547
Let's get him arrested

467
00:59:27,428 --> 00:59:29,623
- Sunmi...
- Yeah

468
00:59:29,897 --> 00:59:34,459
He does live in Year 2000

469
00:59:40,774 --> 00:59:42,969
I understand

470
00:59:43,544 --> 00:59:45,478
I know when you love someone,

471
00:59:45,746 --> 00:59:50,649
you don't want to meet another person

472
00:59:51,218 --> 00:59:54,517
So let him be

473
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:58,788
Why am I still in a cast?

474
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,685
We should set some rules

475
01:00:01,996 --> 01:00:05,022
Don't know how we're communicating
but...

476
01:00:05,633 --> 01:00:09,763
I could give you a fortune
beyond your imagination...

477
01:00:10,404 --> 01:00:12,895
but that's morally wrong

478
01:00:13,173 --> 01:00:14,765
A fortune?

479
01:00:16,744 --> 01:00:19,770
Related to personal wealth

480
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:24,517
For example, I could tell you
real estate information

481
01:00:24,785 --> 01:00:29,347
Or I could tell you
what stock to buy and strike it rich

482
01:00:30,724 --> 01:00:34,820
I agree. Shouldn't do that

483
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:38,496
But I'm from the past
and you're in the future

484
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,700
So I'm more curious

485
01:00:42,903 --> 01:00:43,995
Curiosity?

486
01:00:44,371 --> 01:00:47,067
Naive curiosity

487
01:00:49,176 --> 01:00:51,144
How's the future world?

488
01:00:52,713 --> 01:00:57,980
I guess compared to 1979,
it's very convenient

489
01:00:58,285 --> 01:01:01,413
Subways are everywhere
under the city

490
01:01:02,756 --> 01:01:04,986
What about the Unification?

491
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:08,151
Ilsung Kim is dead
but no Unification yet

492
01:01:08,362 --> 01:01:12,321
Gosh, he dies too

493
01:01:13,934 --> 01:01:17,062
We can travel to Mt. Kumkang
in the north though

494
01:01:18,138 --> 01:01:20,299
Wow, must be exciting!

495
01:01:31,452 --> 01:01:35,684
Is it beautiful?
Worth living in the world?

496
01:01:35,956 --> 01:01:40,052
As always, the world is a good place
to be in

497
01:01:40,327 --> 01:01:45,390
Of course, there is pollution
and population problems

498
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:50,168
So some people reminisce about
what it used to be like

499
01:01:50,938 --> 01:01:58,071
Really? Um...
I wonder what they reminisce about...

500
01:01:58,545 --> 01:02:00,945
I wish I could see the year 2000

501
01:02:01,181 --> 01:02:05,743
I wish I could show you

502
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,553
This world is full of things
you were imagining...

503
01:02:09,857 --> 01:02:13,884
I mean, things you couldn't imagine
became reality

504
01:02:16,997 --> 01:02:21,366
In that world,

505
01:02:21,635 --> 01:02:24,468
if you really love someone
is there a way to make him love me?

506
01:02:27,374 --> 01:02:31,470
I don't think
it will ever be invented

507
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:37,847
Oh, are you in love?

508
01:02:38,085 --> 01:02:40,553
Oops! No!

509
01:02:40,788 --> 01:02:44,815
It's OK. I'm from a different world
anyway

510
01:02:51,098 --> 01:02:59,631
I don't know the definition of love

511
01:02:59,907 --> 01:03:02,774
but I can guess it

512
01:03:03,143 --> 01:03:10,777
He...looks at my eyes
each one at a time

513
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:19,350
He...
What am I saying?

514
01:03:20,127 --> 01:03:22,960
I only say to this to my diary

515
01:03:23,263 --> 01:03:28,462
I can be your diary for a while.
A talking diary

516
01:03:32,606 --> 01:03:34,836
Have you someone you love?

517
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:37,705
Me?

518
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,018
Yes, I do

519
01:03:54,728 --> 01:04:00,530
How much did you drink? I can
smell your alcohol from last night

520
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:07,965
Not last night.
This morning. Hangover chaser!

521
01:04:09,643 --> 01:04:11,941
Hey, get closer!

522
01:04:15,182 --> 01:04:20,381
Be quiet and keep a straight face

523
01:04:23,957 --> 01:04:30,453
I can't keep a straight face
when I'm with him

524
01:04:30,931 --> 01:04:36,096
Don't open your mouth. It stinks

525
01:04:42,509 --> 01:04:46,468
So are you still talking to
that woman from 1979?

526
01:04:46,747 --> 01:04:49,580
Why ask?
You don't even believe me

527
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:51,579
I believe you

528
01:04:51,852 --> 01:04:56,221
You're communicating with someone
from 1979 every night

529
01:04:56,556 --> 01:04:59,116
You're interested in her

530
01:04:59,459 --> 01:05:04,089
But you can't do shit...
because she's from another time

531
01:05:04,431 --> 01:05:06,092
I believe that

532
01:05:07,601 --> 01:05:13,471
What the hell are you saying?
And watch your language

533
01:05:14,474 --> 01:05:17,409
You start cursing
when you get jealous

534
01:05:17,644 --> 01:05:21,478
Did you say jealous?

535
01:05:22,082 --> 01:05:25,176
Do you think I feel jealous about
that crazy women...

536
01:05:25,485 --> 01:05:29,182
and the show you're putting on?

537
01:05:29,222 --> 01:05:30,314
I think...

538
01:05:30,524 --> 01:05:34,483
You...
You're too happy

539
01:05:34,828 --> 01:05:36,921
Nothing to worry about

540
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:41,064
So you're
looking for something different

541
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:44,867
Please, don't include me in it!

542
01:06:19,406 --> 01:06:21,374
Looking for Donghee?

543
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:24,944
Not really...

544
01:06:25,212 --> 01:06:27,510
- He got hurt during a demonstration
- What?

545
01:06:28,048 --> 01:06:33,111
He's in the hospital behind the school.
He just checked in

546
01:06:34,688 --> 01:06:36,087
I see...

547
01:07:57,104 --> 01:07:58,298
Oh, Soeun!

548
01:08:08,115 --> 01:08:10,675
Do I look that bad?

549
01:08:13,053 --> 01:08:16,045
I don't know I had bad luck
or I'm just not coordinated

550
01:08:16,323 --> 01:08:18,814
I'm the only one who fell

551
01:08:21,128 --> 01:08:22,254
Got a pen?

552
01:08:23,363 --> 01:08:27,265
Sign it.
So it will get better quicker

553
01:08:42,849 --> 01:08:46,808
Got to go. I'll stop to see
Sunmi on the way

554
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:51,879
- Right! She's in here, too
- Downstairs

555
01:08:56,796 --> 01:09:01,028
The president will be changed
this month anyway

556
01:09:02,435 --> 01:09:06,030
Thank you.
I hope you're right

557
01:09:12,112 --> 01:09:16,674
I inscribed my name on him

558
01:09:17,117 --> 01:09:20,143
Interesting, you mean like a tattoo?

559
01:09:21,421 --> 01:09:28,759
Sort of. It's weird to think
I have my name on him

560
01:09:29,262 --> 01:09:31,127
I feel like I own him

561
01:09:31,431 --> 01:09:34,491
An arm is swinging with my name.
He's walking, swinging me

562
01:09:34,734 --> 01:09:40,070
Sorry?
It's similar to my parents' story

563
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:47,202
That's what my Mom wrote
when she met Dad

564
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,640
Your Mom?

565
01:09:51,818 --> 01:09:57,085
Oh! My parents went to
the same university as us

566
01:09:57,324 --> 01:10:01,454
Let me see...
Entered the school in 1977

567
01:10:01,728 --> 01:10:04,253
Why didn't I think of that?
They're going to school with you!

568
01:10:04,998 --> 01:10:09,059
Oh my god! Who are they?
I'd know them!

569
01:10:09,836 --> 01:10:14,864
My Mom's Sunmi Hur, and
my Dad's name is Donghee Jee

570
01:10:15,442 --> 01:10:17,876
Do you know them?

571
01:10:22,315 --> 01:10:28,220
Of course. We've the same major...

572
01:10:29,155 --> 01:10:32,522
Do you know them well?

573
01:10:35,662 --> 01:10:40,395
Not really, just...

574
01:10:41,368 --> 01:10:44,997
You say your father's name was
Donghee?

575
01:10:45,538 --> 01:10:52,910
Yes, you know him?
They were a famous couple

576
01:10:56,449 --> 01:11:00,943
Yes, of course...

577
01:11:01,921 --> 01:11:06,483
Wow...I can't believe this!

578
01:11:09,729 --> 01:11:14,223
They look very good together

579
01:11:17,337 --> 01:11:22,138
Wow...how's my mother?
What's her nickname?

580
01:12:05,919 --> 01:12:09,980
You...

581
01:12:17,597 --> 01:12:20,293
Is this a fad?

582
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,480
Who is it?

583
01:12:48,395 --> 01:12:50,124
What the hell?!

584
01:12:51,131 --> 01:12:55,693
Visiting my friend

585
01:12:57,704 --> 01:13:00,468
Something wrong?
Jesus!

586
01:13:08,915 --> 01:13:10,473
Are you drunk?

587
01:13:11,017 --> 01:13:13,144
What am I, an alcoholic?

588
01:14:59,392 --> 01:15:01,952
No, it can't be.
It's all a lie

589
01:15:02,228 --> 01:15:08,997
How can he be in 2000?
Does that make sense?

590
01:15:09,736 --> 01:15:19,941
I'm gonna turn that crook over
to the police

591
01:17:45,758 --> 01:17:48,352
What an accident! Hur Sunmi

592
01:18:55,762 --> 01:18:59,391
- Are you sure that's true?
- I'm positive!

593
01:18:59,665 --> 01:19:04,796
It can't be Hyunji.
You sure it wasn't someone else?

594
01:19:05,638 --> 01:19:13,670
I thought I was dying.
That's a very famous bar

595
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:17,475
Are you sure it was Hyunji?
Did you see her?

596
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:22,346
- Not too close but...
- You're full of it

597
01:19:22,922 --> 01:19:27,382
Her clothes and make up were
exactly the same

598
01:19:27,827 --> 01:19:32,093
She must be in need of money

599
01:19:34,033 --> 01:19:35,091
Hi!

600
01:19:39,438 --> 01:19:41,906
Are we talking about Hyunji
working at the bar?

601
01:19:42,441 --> 01:19:45,069
- You knew?
- You guys didn't know?

602
01:19:45,344 --> 01:19:47,744
See? I told you

603
01:19:48,014 --> 01:19:52,815
She works there
because she likes to drink

604
01:20:38,698 --> 01:20:42,759
You are very quiet today...

605
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:51,271
It's one of those days

606
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,708
Have you met my parents?

607
01:20:59,118 --> 01:21:06,115
They look so good together

608
01:21:10,162 --> 01:21:14,690
I wish everything looked so good

609
01:21:17,803 --> 01:21:20,101
How's your boy friend?

610
01:21:21,707 --> 01:21:24,175
I was thinking maybe...

611
01:21:24,477 --> 01:21:30,416
We're not destined to be
with each other

612
01:21:38,157 --> 01:21:44,687
Not everything's destined for
each other

613
01:21:45,731 --> 01:21:50,862
You say a destination before you leave,
not when you get there

614
01:22:20,633 --> 01:22:22,794
Finally, I'm out!

615
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:25,931
You scared me.
Don't ever do that

616
01:22:31,744 --> 01:22:37,910
Soeun, what's wrong?
Aren't you happy that I'm back?

617
01:22:38,784 --> 01:22:40,809
I'm all better

618
01:22:44,423 --> 01:22:47,654
I don't feel like fooling around

619
01:22:55,534 --> 01:22:56,728
Want some?

620
01:23:57,163 --> 01:23:58,892
Hello

621
01:23:59,265 --> 01:24:04,601
Going to my parents' country house

622
01:24:05,071 --> 01:24:08,666
To get something

623
01:24:11,777 --> 01:24:13,142
Have you been drinking?

624
01:24:14,447 --> 01:24:18,816
Stupid! Am I an alcoholic?

625
01:24:20,886 --> 01:24:26,188
When do you come back?
Be careful

626
01:24:26,525 --> 01:24:28,117
OK

627
01:25:57,416 --> 01:25:59,384
It's a good luck charm, Soeun

628
01:26:01,153 --> 01:26:03,951
How do you feel?

629
01:26:05,658 --> 01:26:11,722
Can I keep this as a souvenir?

630
01:26:14,767 --> 01:26:16,496
Soeun?

631
01:27:12,725 --> 01:27:14,488
What brings you here?

632
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:18,493
I just wanted to see you

633
01:27:19,932 --> 01:27:24,892
I heard you left school early

634
01:27:25,204 --> 01:27:27,502
So I was worried

635
01:27:28,307 --> 01:27:31,936
Don't worry.
Everything's fine

636
01:27:34,013 --> 01:27:35,605
Wanna take a walk?

637
01:27:40,386 --> 01:27:42,911
Can you grab my arm?

638
01:27:49,962 --> 01:27:51,361
Can you do it?

639
01:28:06,011 --> 01:28:08,844
Do you have a boyfriend?

640
01:28:10,849 --> 01:28:15,980
If anybody sees us,
they'll think we're lovers

641
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:24,588
Are you here to say that?

642
01:28:26,465 --> 01:28:27,625
Sort of...

643
01:28:30,402 --> 01:28:37,365
If we are lovers, they'd know
even if we're not holding hands

644
01:31:43,595 --> 01:31:49,090
People are in mourning for
the death of President Park...

645
01:31:49,968 --> 01:31:53,233
who passed away at 7:50pm on the 26th

646
01:31:53,605 --> 01:31:57,837
House Representative Choi
has taken over the Presidency...

647
01:31:58,143 --> 01:32:01,704
and the Defense Minister...

648
01:32:02,014 --> 01:32:03,447
Going to school?

649
01:32:06,785 --> 01:32:10,243
Honey? Honey!

650
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:19,829
It's OK. There won't be a war
or anything

651
01:32:20,132 --> 01:32:21,793
Everything will be fine

652
01:32:33,512 --> 01:32:36,538
Soeun! Soeun!

653
01:32:39,284 --> 01:32:40,512
Hi!

654
01:32:41,787 --> 01:32:47,089
Everything you said came true.
Dictatorship will be over

655
01:32:47,426 --> 01:32:49,587
I'm sure you didn't foresee the future

656
01:32:49,928 --> 01:32:55,992
but everything you said
became reality

657
01:34:00,699 --> 01:34:02,166
In!

658
01:34:03,535 --> 01:34:04,559
Did you find out?

659
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:11,371
Hey, hold your horses...
Did you find out?

660
01:34:12,377 --> 01:34:14,811
She is no longer here

661
01:34:15,847 --> 01:34:20,307
Passed away?
Dead? Is she sick?

662
01:34:20,786 --> 01:34:22,583
She was transferred to
Chonan University 2 years ago

663
01:34:22,754 --> 01:34:25,518
- What?
- She is an English professor

664
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:28,658
Was she ill?
I saw her picture and she was beautiful

665
01:34:28,927 --> 01:34:32,385
She's still single

666
01:34:34,032 --> 01:34:35,192
No

667
01:34:39,604 --> 01:34:41,765
So she transferred voluntarily?

668
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:49,271
Yes, we didn't want to let her go
but she had personal reasons

669
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:53,017
Same year I came to school

670
01:34:57,189 --> 01:35:02,286
If she were to choose my father...

671
01:35:06,064 --> 01:35:12,435
and married him,
what would happen to me?

672
01:35:14,272 --> 01:35:16,240
Then...

673
01:35:18,276 --> 01:35:20,437
That can't happen

674
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,778
Because the world is one

675
01:35:24,049 --> 01:35:27,485
we live in the dimension
that is parallel to time

676
01:35:27,753 --> 01:35:34,215
There can't be another dimension
with the same organism

677
01:35:34,459 --> 01:35:39,260
This can't be proven by science...

678
01:35:39,564 --> 01:35:41,998
What the hell am I saying?

679
01:35:42,267 --> 01:35:51,198
Anyway,
I don't believe in any of this

680
01:35:52,477 --> 01:35:56,675
Your agony is an interesting
S/F melodrama

681
01:35:57,015 --> 01:36:02,681
But I'm not really interested.
That's it. No more!

682
01:36:02,988 --> 01:36:06,253
I don't believe in that machine

683
01:36:06,591 --> 01:36:10,425
either with or without electricity

684
01:36:11,229 --> 01:36:19,466
communicating with a woman
from the past!

685
01:36:20,305 --> 01:36:24,036
What's this?
Is this an alarm also?

686
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:26,770
Yes

687
01:36:29,648 --> 01:36:31,639
This is Soeun

688
01:36:32,951 --> 01:36:40,323
I was searching for you
but I couldn't connect

689
01:36:46,731 --> 01:36:47,925
Well...

690
01:36:56,241 --> 01:37:01,873
I travelled for a few days

691
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:06,942
I'm sorry

692
01:37:09,921 --> 01:37:12,890
I broke up with him

693
01:37:14,759 --> 01:37:17,922
He wasn't right for me

694
01:37:23,335 --> 01:37:31,071
As you told me, I wanted to find out
if he was my destination

695
01:37:33,278 --> 01:37:36,111
But I didn't think it was right

696
01:37:45,824 --> 01:37:53,230
So I let go of him from my heart

697
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:58,700
And I walked for a long time

698
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:15,747
Walked every corner of the school

699
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:27,929
They say people live with a scent

700
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:35,399
And they scatter the scent everywhere

701
01:38:37,275 --> 01:38:44,010
When the scent is gone, they die

702
01:38:44,716 --> 01:38:49,119
But some people still have the scent
after death

703
01:38:50,956 --> 01:39:00,092
And some people pass on the scent
to others

704
01:39:01,232 --> 01:39:10,231
Then it can spread everywhere

705
01:39:11,676 --> 01:39:19,242
I know his scent

706
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:28,949
I'd recognize it with my eyes closed

707
01:39:29,427 --> 01:39:37,562
Him and I. We definitely
live with the same emotion

708
01:39:38,903 --> 01:39:41,503
Same sorrow, same joy

709
01:39:47,278 --> 01:39:58,519
We'd keep the same scent and live forever

710
01:40:00,191 --> 01:40:05,652
The feeling that I have in 1979

711
01:40:06,664 --> 01:40:12,830
I'm sure you will be able to feel it
in 2000

712
01:40:17,143 --> 01:40:21,170
You think it's right after
all these years?

713
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:25,246
I just want to say I'm sorry

714
01:40:26,786 --> 01:40:31,485
If not, just want to see her face.
See if she's all right

715
01:40:32,858 --> 01:40:38,125
I wish she'd look happy

716
01:40:38,431 --> 01:40:46,099
If she looks sad or depressed,
what am I going to do?

717
01:40:48,441 --> 01:40:51,740
I couldn't stand it

718
01:40:54,413 --> 01:40:55,573
In!

719
01:41:11,764 --> 01:41:13,197
Go!

720
01:41:16,836 --> 01:41:18,303
Thanks

721
01:41:52,638 --> 01:41:59,100
- Professor Yoon here?
- She's in class. Room 1

722
01:44:49,148 --> 01:44:51,878
Soeun. I saw you today

723
01:44:54,219 --> 01:44:57,219
You looked so beautiful and happy

724
01:45:07,866 --> 01:45:12,633
You seemed to be doing well

725
01:45:14,039 --> 01:45:17,907
When you pass me by...

726
01:45:20,846 --> 01:45:30,278
I could feel
your scent you talked about

727
01:45:55,247 --> 01:45:59,149
I don't think it's working anymore

728
01:46:01,487 --> 01:46:03,648
This radio...

729
01:46:05,424 --> 01:46:11,021
It's a bad thing!

730
01:46:12,698 --> 01:46:14,928
Hey, hey...
What are you doing this late?

731
01:46:17,603 --> 01:46:19,571
You guys again?

732
01:46:19,872 --> 01:46:25,435
Nothing...
Fixing something...

733
01:46:25,811 --> 01:46:28,075
Is that the way to fix it?

734
01:46:28,981 --> 01:46:33,179
Trying to destroy it?

735
01:46:37,489 --> 01:46:40,083
Won't be easy

736
01:46:42,694 --> 01:46:49,896
Go home.
That's how time passes

737
01:47:07,286 --> 01:47:15,921
No one will believe what we've been
through for the last several months. Right

738
01:47:16,795 --> 01:47:23,564
He's right.
That's how time passes

739
01:47:23,869 --> 01:47:29,136
There's nothing we can do to change
what is meant to be

740
01:47:30,742 --> 01:47:33,267
You want to grab my arm?

741
01:47:35,247 --> 01:47:39,547
Why all of a sudden?

742
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:47,820
- Do it!
- You're embarrassing me
