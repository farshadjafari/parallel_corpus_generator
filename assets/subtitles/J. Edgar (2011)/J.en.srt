502
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,507
The family in Νew York or the baby?

503
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:11,470
Miss Gandy, five years is not enough.
We need men willing to dedicate their lives.

504
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,138
How many is that so far?

505
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:18,560
-That's 320 denied and 21 interviews.
-Hmm.

506
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:22,856
Did we receive an application
from a Mr. Tolson?

507
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,192
Yes.

508
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,156
Yes, his report states
he has confidence, poise...

509
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,742
...his diction is excellent.

510
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,413
But although physically fitted for it,
might be displeased with rugged work.

511
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:42,876
His only interest is to gain experience
that would benefit a private law practice.

512
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,630
And he has no interest in being here
for any period of time...

513
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,675
...which would render
employment speculative.

514
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,885
Hmm.

515
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,763
He did receive
a letter of recommendation...

516
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,392
...from the executive assistant
of the Secretary of War.

517
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,019
That's fantastic‚ Miss Gandy.

518
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:08,193
Yes. lt mentions here that Mr. Tolson
showed no particular interest in women.

519
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:16,076
Then again, some of our best agents excel
because they have no family encumbrance.

00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,414
Yes, you're right. Set up an interview.

You know what the problem is,
Miss Gandy?

522
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,714
These men‚ they don't--
They don't look up to me.

523
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,048
Of course they do.

524
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:35,137
I don't mean figuratively.
I mean they don't look up to me.

525
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:39,266
Well, if you could conduct the entire
interview from behind your desk...

526
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:44,646
...instead of walking about the office‚
I could correct that.

527
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,481
Indeed.

528
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:52,779
Miss Gandy, suppose I had information
on someone in a position of power...

529
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,324
...harmful information.

530
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,703
It goes against my nature
to destroy such information...

531
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,873
...but I don't trust it
in the general files either.

532
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,626
Could I trust it with you?

533
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,881
If we were to create a confidential file?

534
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,508
Of course‚ Edgar.

00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,762

What were you doing with wiretaps

You asked that I pursue this

Mr. Hoover, I asked you to pursue
a real threat.

We bugged the basement of a home

If this information were to go public...

562
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,737
...it would create widespread distrust
in your brother's leadership capabilities.

Do you know what it took
to change his mind?
