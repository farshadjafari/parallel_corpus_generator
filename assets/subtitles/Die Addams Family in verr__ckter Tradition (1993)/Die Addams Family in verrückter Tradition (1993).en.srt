all my references

I'm not a homicidal maniac.

192

- Of course you're not.
- You're too young.

Welcome to our home.

194
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,192
There's a belfry,
a swamp,

195
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:12,260
and a dungeon down below.

196
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:15,241
- Cable?
- Of course.

198
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:23,782
Oh, is that
the little critter?

199
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:26,918
Oh, no.
This is our baby.

200
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:29,521
He's adorable. He's perfect.
What's his name?

201
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,089
It was agony.

202
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,604

Oh, I just adore

I'm such a lucky man.

I hope that someday you'll know
the indescribable joy

of having children

and of paying someone else
to raise them.

First wouldn't I
have to get married?

00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:14,476
three very different women
with one thing in common--

279
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:18,486
And they're all
the same woman.

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,360
She's known by the police
as the Black Widow.

281
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:23,230
She mates,
then she kills.

loneliest bachelors,

gaining their trust
and their love,

and finally,
she marries them.

286
00:16:32,315 --> 00:16:34,785
Then, on the wedding night,
she kills them.

The deaths
appear accidental.

00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,083
After the funeral,
she disappears, cash in hand,

but the money
never lasts.

is hungry again,

291

hungry for love.

will she next assume?

00:50:42,945 --> 00:50:47,441
I don't understand.
For weeks not a word, and now this.

932
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,546
Darling, come to bed.
He can't be serious.

933
00:50:50,623 --> 00:50:52,991
Have I done something,
said something?

934
00:50:53,061 --> 00:50:55,428
Why does my brother
despise me?

935
00:50:55,498 --> 00:50:57,330
He adores you.

936
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,870
I'd do anything for him.

937
00:50:59,938 --> 00:51:03,000
At his request,
I would rip out my eyes.

938
00:51:03,077 --> 00:51:06,138
At his command,
I would crawl on my belly

939
00:51:06,214 --> 00:51:08,878
through hot coals
and broken glass.

940
00:51:08,952 --> 00:51:10,045
Why wait?

941
00:51:10,121 --> 00:51:11,919
Has Fester gone mad?

942
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:15,121
This is all just
some sort of phase.

943
00:51:15,196 --> 00:51:16,356
Post-honeymoon malaise.

944
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:19,230
It's very common.

945
00:51:19,302 --> 00:51:21,828
Do you remember
our honeymoon?

946
00:51:21,906 --> 00:51:24,672
That glorious cruise.

947
00:51:24,744 --> 00:51:26,508
No quarrels.

948
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,843
No cares.

949
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,614
No survivors.

950
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,714
Cara mia.

951
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,453
So...

952
00:51:35,527 --> 00:51:38,157
you still desire me
after all these years?

953
00:51:38,232 --> 00:51:40,201
The old ball and chain?

954
00:51:40,268 --> 00:51:41,327
Forever.

955
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:44,064
I'll get them.

956
00:51:47,012 --> 00:51:49,379
Heads up, campers.
Thejamboree's only two weeks away.

957
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:52,511
And you know what that means--
clean cabins.

958
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:54,454
Creating with clay and...

959
00:51:54,524 --> 00:51:56,356
Canoes, canoes, canoes!

960
00:51:56,428 --> 00:51:59,421
So we better
get cracking, huh?

961
00:51:59,498 --> 00:52:02,560
Look at this.
I've got them.

962
00:52:02,637 --> 00:52:04,572
Schizos and Serial Killers.

963
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,167
I have almost
the whole series.

964
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:11,013
I'm only missing Jack the Ripper
and that Zodiac guy.

965
00:52:11,084 --> 00:52:12,074
But look.

966
00:52:12,152 --> 00:52:13,984
"The Black Widow."

967
00:52:14,055 --> 00:52:15,717
It might be Debbie.

968
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:19,388
At least three rich husbands...

969
00:52:19,464 --> 00:52:21,262
all dead.

970
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:22,926
I'll trade you.

971
00:52:23,003 --> 00:52:24,062
For what?

972
00:52:26,942 --> 00:52:28,843
Amy Fischer.

973
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:31,279
Each year,
we conclude our summer

974
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:33,875
with a very special
presentation.

975
00:52:33,953 --> 00:52:35,615
Book, music,
and lyrics by...

976
00:52:35,689 --> 00:52:37,590
Gary Granger!

977
00:52:39,194 --> 00:52:40,890
And this year,

978
00:52:40,964 --> 00:52:44,231
the old bean has come up
with something pretty exciting--

979
00:52:44,303 --> 00:52:46,899
my own personal salute
to the first Thanksgiving.

980
00:52:46,974 --> 00:52:50,173
Now, we have thought
long and hard

981
00:52:50,246 --> 00:52:53,376
about choosing
just the right little actress

982
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:56,444
for the leading role
of Sarah Miller,

983
00:52:56,522 --> 00:52:58,719
our beautiful
and kindly pilgrim lady,

984
00:52:58,793 --> 00:53:01,695
and we have selected...

985
00:53:04,034 --> 00:53:07,597
Amanda Buckman!

986
00:53:07,673 --> 00:53:10,906
And in the roles
of her pilgrim pals--

987
00:53:10,978 --> 00:53:12,776
Lily, Jennifer,
Tiffany, Missy,

988
00:53:12,848 --> 00:53:16,217
Michelle, and Melissa!

989
00:53:18,056 --> 00:53:22,324
But, of course,
not everyone can be a star.

990
00:53:22,396 --> 00:53:25,890
Let's not forget
our cheery little Chippewas

991
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,632
Mordecai, Yang,

992
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,541
Esther...

993
00:53:31,611 --> 00:53:32,600
um...

994
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:36,618
Consuela, Irwin...

995
00:53:36,686 --> 00:53:37,948
and, um...

996
00:53:38,021 --> 00:53:41,389
I'm still not sure just
how to pronounce this.

997
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,258
Jam-il?Jame-il?

998
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,319
[Gary]
Jamal.

999
00:53:44,398 --> 00:53:45,798
Whatever.

1000
00:53:45,867 --> 00:53:49,430
And as their leader
in the secondary

1001
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:53,103
but still compellingly
written role of Pocahontas,

1002
00:53:53,178 --> 00:53:56,308
guess who we have in mind.

1003
00:53:56,383 --> 00:53:59,411
Our own little
brunette outcast--

1004
00:53:59,488 --> 00:54:01,423
Wednesday Addams.

1005
00:54:08,869 --> 00:54:11,305
[Chimes Play Wedding March]

1006
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:19,250
We want to see
Debbie and Fester.

1007
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:22,381
Miss Debbie!

1008
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:23,687
[Debbie]
Debra!

1009
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:26,755
Gomez...

1010
00:54:26,832 --> 00:54:28,664
where are we?

1011
00:54:28,734 --> 00:54:30,930
It looks familiar.

1012
00:54:31,004 --> 00:54:33,338
Of course--
the gates of hell.

1013
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,737
Welcome to my home.

1014
00:54:36,814 --> 00:54:38,373
Might we see my brother?

1015
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:43,185
No. He doesn't want to see
any of you or that.

1016
00:54:43,257 --> 00:54:44,316
Why not?

1017
00:54:44,392 --> 00:54:46,293
Because he's in love.

1018
00:54:46,362 --> 00:54:48,696
He's wrapped in a gossamer
blanket of ecstasy,

1019
00:54:48,766 --> 00:54:50,530
and he hates your guts.

1020
00:54:50,603 --> 00:54:51,865
But why?

1021
00:54:51,937 --> 00:54:53,804
Because you've
flaunted yourselves,

1022
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:56,003
your great love affair.

1023
00:54:56,078 --> 00:54:58,547
You kept him a child.

1024
00:54:58,615 --> 00:55:00,447
I've made him a man.

1025
00:55:00,518 --> 00:55:03,011
Let me hear this
from his own lips.

1026
00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:05,490
His lips are busy.

1027
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:07,586
You want to talk
to these people?

1028
00:55:07,663 --> 00:55:08,630
Debbie.

1029
00:55:12,703 --> 00:55:13,671
Oh.

1030
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:14,729
Go away!

1031
00:55:14,807 --> 00:55:16,742
That is not my brother.

1032
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:18,005
Sorry.

1033
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,911
You have
enslaved him.

1034
00:55:19,982 --> 00:55:21,848
You have
placed Fester

1035
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:23,581
under some strange
sexual spell.

1036
00:55:23,655 --> 00:55:27,058
I respect that.
But, please, may we see him?

1037
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:28,755
Don't even
think about it.

1038
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:30,354
You have gone
too far.

1039
00:55:30,432 --> 00:55:31,923
You have
married Fester.

1040
00:55:32,001 --> 00:55:33,492
You have destroyed
his spirit.

1041
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:36,097
You have taken him
from us.

1042
00:55:36,174 --> 00:55:37,665
All that
I could forgive.

1043
00:55:37,743 --> 00:55:39,041
But, Debbie...

1044
00:55:39,112 --> 00:55:40,512
What?

1045
00:55:41,783 --> 00:55:42,910
Pastels?

1046
00:55:42,985 --> 00:55:45,147
Get out of my house!

1047
00:55:45,221 --> 00:55:47,053
Hit the road!

1048
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:50,357
And if you ever
show your faces around here again,

1049
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:54,335
I'll have you locked up
for trying to visit.

1050
00:55:54,403 --> 00:55:55,529
Right, Fessie?

1051
00:55:55,605 --> 00:55:56,573
Right!

1052
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:10,321
Luxor, nexor,
burst, and burn!

1053
00:56:10,395 --> 00:56:12,261
What is she doing?

1054
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:14,961
Just a curse.
Have a nice day.

1055
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,973
I demand justice!

1056
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:24,346
Someone has married
my brother.

1057
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:25,851
No.

1058
00:56:25,919 --> 00:56:27,751
She took him to Hawaii.

1059
00:56:27,822 --> 00:56:30,884
They have moved into
a large, expensive home

1060
00:56:30,961 --> 00:56:32,759
where they make love
constantly.

1061
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,560
I hate
when that happens.

1062
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:36,568
Arrest her at once
without delay.

1063
00:56:36,636 --> 00:56:38,571
- Who?
- Debbie.

1064
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:42,703
My brother's wife,
the temptress of Waikiki.

1065
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,974
Who are you?

1066
00:56:44,049 --> 00:56:46,484
What are you?
Who moved the rock?

1067
00:56:46,552 --> 00:56:48,544
Officer,
you must issue a subpoena.

1068
00:56:48,622 --> 00:56:50,591
I believe they own...

1069
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:51,683
Gomez, no!

1070
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,693
A Buick!

1071
00:56:52,762 --> 00:56:54,788
Just leave.
Leave quietly. Leave now.

1072
00:56:54,865 --> 00:56:58,098
Don't make me call
Ringling Brothers.

1073
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,966
Has the planet gone mad?

1074
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:05,682
My brother... passion's hostage.

1075
00:57:05,749 --> 00:57:07,377
I seek justice.

1076
00:57:07,452 --> 00:57:09,182
Denied.

1077
00:57:09,254 --> 00:57:14,058
I shall not submit.
I shall conquer. I shall rise.

1078
00:57:14,129 --> 00:57:19,536
My name is Gomez Addams,
and I have seen evil!

1079
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:21,505
I have seen horror!

1080
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:26,437
I have seen
the unholy maggots

1081
00:57:26,515 --> 00:57:31,148
which feast in the dark recesses
of the human soul!

1082
00:57:31,223 --> 00:57:32,714
They're at camp.

1083
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:35,455
I have seen all this,
Officer.

1084
00:57:35,529 --> 00:57:37,395
But until today,

1085
00:57:37,466 --> 00:57:40,868
I had never seen...

1086
00:57:42,674 --> 00:57:43,732
you!

1087
00:57:44,811 --> 00:57:49,341
Hook him, book him,
cook him. Now!

1088
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:51,250
Next in line.

1089
00:57:51,321 --> 00:57:53,847
Yes, I'd like to renew
my passport, please.

1090
00:57:53,925 --> 00:57:55,985
I'll be leaving the country
very shortly.

1091
00:57:56,061 --> 00:57:57,324
Traveling alone?

1092
00:57:57,397 --> 00:58:00,459
Yes. I'll be a widow.

Gar, come and take
a look at this.

1104
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:35,479
Here they are!

1105
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:37,025
They were
by the phone.

1106
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:38,584
We were calling the FBI.

1107
00:58:38,662 --> 00:58:40,153
Their uncle's in trouble.

1108
00:58:40,232 --> 00:58:42,360
You're late for your fittings.

1109
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,667
I don't want to be
in the pageant.

1110
00:58:44,739 --> 00:58:47,368
You won't help me
realize my vision?
