ReSlaN MoHaMeD
Help me on my new www.Blurayz.org

2
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,051
Becca?

3
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:02,946
Becca?

4
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:07,212
Oh... Hey Peg.

5
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:08,970
It looks so nice back here.

6
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:11,855
Well, I’m just, you know, trying to
get things back into shape.

7
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,915
Listen, I don’t know if you and
Howie are free tonigh

8
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:16,429
having a few people over for
dinner.

9
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:18,364
Oh, that’s very sweet of you.

10
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,970
I know it’s really short notice.

11
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,039
Actually, we have plans.

12
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,003
Oh. Oh, well.

13
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:27,338
But, uh, another time though. I
haven’t talked to Pete in ages.

14
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:31,341
Well you haven’t missed much. He’s
still the same S.O.B. he always was.

15
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:34,383
Oh God. I’m so sorry.

16
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:36,509
It’s okay.

17
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:37,411
I am so sorry.

18
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:38,695
No, it’s fine.

19
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:39,871
These stupid feet.

20
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:43,270
Well, have a great dinner, Peg.

21
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,048
We’ll do it next time.

22
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:47,207
Absolutely.

23
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:51,121
Say hi to Howie for me.

24
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:52,445
I sure will.

25
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:54,514
Goodbye

26
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:19,846
Mmmm. Smells good in there.

27
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:22,307
If Peg asks, we went out tonight.

28
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:26,529
Where’d we go?

29
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:29,130
We saw the Stoppard play.

30
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:30,186
Really?

31
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:31,784
Did we enjoy it?

32
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:32,893
Very much.

33
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:37,445
She asked us to dinner again.

34
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:40,714
She's just being nice.

35
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,526
You're more than welcome to go over
there.

36
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:52,792
And abandon your risotto?

37
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,394
Careful, Howie. The pan’s hot.

38
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:05,378
Hey...

39
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,056
Hey...
I’m gonna hop in the shower.

40
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:10,987
Uh-huh. About twenty minutes.

41
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:33,504
Hello?

42
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:38,987
What time is it?

43
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:43,310
What’s going on?

44
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,147
You have nothing to say?

45
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:02,434
Thank you?

46
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,331
You were in a bar-fight

47
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:06,599
it wasn't a bar-fight

48
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,219
You were in a bar. Fighting.

49
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:15,597
It wasn’t a fight. Some drunk girlwas screaming
in my face, so I hit her and that was the end of it.

50
00:06:15,222 --> 00:06:17,168
Well who was she?

51
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,538
I don’t know.

52
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:21,351
People don’t scream at you for no
reason.

53
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,495
Sure they do, you should get out
more.

54
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,221
God Izzy, it’s so... Jerry Springer.

55
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:30,138
What’s that supposed to mean? You
think I’m trashy?

56
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,092
You can’t keep doing this. You’re
not a kid anymore.

57
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,921
I didn’t know there was a cutoff
date.

58
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:37,629
Well there is. For acting like ajackass,
there’s a cutoff date...

59
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:40,334
I wanna stop worrying about you.

60
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:44,060
Hey, don't worry about me. She was
the one on the floor.

61
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:48,887
Can I stay with you tonight?

62
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,580
Danny, look at me when you come
back.

63
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:30,605
He’s getting used to it.

64
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:31,932
- Do you want any cake?
- Yeah!

65
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:33,739
Oh, do we have cake today?

66
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:35,280
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we do.

67
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:40,464
Oh, my gosh. And you really want
some?

68
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,857
Well, if it isn’t Ma Barker.

69
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:09,001
I’m sure that would be very funny
if I knew who that was.

70
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:10,267
Rick and I are gonna play squash.

71
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,306
I have my cell if you need me.

72
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:15,681
Squash. You go play squash, Howie.

73
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:17,580
You don’t even know what squash is.

74
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,756
I don’t care what squash is

75
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:21,802
Hello?

76
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:26,443
Yeah! Yeah.

77
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:30,202
I thought she was gonna kill me!

78
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:33,128
Yeah, I know. I think Auggie must
have told her.

79
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:35,027
Hey, I gotta go.

80
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,287
Mmm. Thank you Becca.

81
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:46,163
Oo, I like the way it cracks.

82
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:47,850
Of course you do.

83
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:50,525
So you did know that woman.

84
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:53,231
Oh my god! Why are you listening
to my phone conversations?

85
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:56,396
Are you sleeping with that girl’s
boyfriend.

86
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,264
It’s been over between them.
They’re just living together because of the rent.

87
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,424
Then why did she accost you?

88
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:02,762
Because she's a lunatic!

89
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:08,436
And Auggie told her I was pregnant

90
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:13,289
You are not.

91
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,302
You’re gonna love him. He’s a
really great guy. He’s a musician!

92
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:19,233
That's terrific.

93
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,942
He works, Becca. He gets work as a
musician.

94
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,754
How long have you known?

95
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:26,233
A few weeks.

96
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:27,816
Did you tell Mom?

97
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:31,508
Oh, come on. You told Mom before
me?

98
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:32,778
I had to.

99
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:34,221
Why didn’t you tell me?

100
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:35,275
Why do you think?

101
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:44,485
- I’m sorry, Becca. I know the timing really sucks.
- Hey, what can ya do?

102
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,444
I’m just glad you finally told me.

103
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:15,910
Debbie’s been driving me crazy with
these kitchen renovations.

104
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:18,617
The
counter-top negotiations alone...

105
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:19,992
I told you not to marry an agent

106
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:24,032
She still hasn't called, you know.

107
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,880
No, I know.

108
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:31,101
I don’t mean to be a pest about it,
but...

109
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:34,264
I just know Becca would
love to hear from her.

110
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:39,682
I know. I tell her, Howie. I do.
But she’s still...

111
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,710
I don’t know
freaked out, I guess.

112
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:46,995
It’s been eight months.

113
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,211
I know. I'll talk to her.

114
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,617
Thank you.

115
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,870
Hey, how are the kids?

116
00:10:54,538 --> 00:11:00,087
They’re good. Emily's doing
ballet. Robby is in tee-ball.

117
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,450
Wow. Tee-ball.

118
00:11:08,162 --> 00:11:12,031
Have you guys talked at all about
having another?

119
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:16,891
No.

120
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:20,866
It's a little soon.

121
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:24,923
Just be open-minded.

122
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:26,818
I’m here, aren’t I?

123
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:38,170
How’s it going?

124
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:39,592
Good.

125
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:40,408
Yeah, good. Hanging in there.

126
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:41,651
You sure?

127
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:53,424
Yeah. Yeah, um, we just...
found out that Becca’s sister is pregnant. So.

128
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:54,148
Howie.

129
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:55,343
What?

130
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:59,001
That can be hard, I remember when
my cousin got pregnant-

131
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,321
Yeah, it's not really a big deal

132
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,828
Okay. If you wanna talk about it though,
you know the group’s right here.

133
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:11,545
Yeah, I don't think so. "Hey
everybody, fresh meat."

134
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:13,462
Becca, be nice.

135
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:14,834
Doesn’t she remind of you of Lydia?

136
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:18,034
There was this woman in the group a
couple years ago

137
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:20,464
It was four. Four years ago.

138
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,230
Well it doesn’t really matter whenshe was here,
my point is that she reminds me of Lydia.

139
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:30,028
She reallywasn’t into the
support group model at first.

140
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:31,963
How long have you been in Group?

141
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:34,145
It’ll be eight years in June.

142
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:42,161
Oh, I didn’t... I didn’t realize
it was that long.

143
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,035
Yeah, we’re the veterans. You know
for us,

144
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:50,311
it’s a good way to touch base.
Everyone’s on a different schedule...

145
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:52,034
Of course.

146
00:12:57,656 --> 00:13:06,658
She, uh, she visits me sometimes.In dreams.
And she tells me it’s okay. And she’s with God.

147
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:21,461
And we have good days. Then youthink that if you have
enough gooddays it might actually get better. But then...

148
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,360
It was her anniversary last week.

149
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:25,539
A year last Tuesday.

150
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:34,507
And it just starts all over again.
We just have to remind each other

151
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:47,415
that it was just part of God’s plan.
And we can’t know why. Only God can know why.

152
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,960
God had to take her. He needed
another angel.

153
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,313
He needed another angel.

154
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:57,684
Why didn’t he just make one?

155
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:02,958
Another angel. I mean, he’s God
after all.

156
00:14:03,312 --> 00:14:05,561
Why didn’t he just make
another angel?

157
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:20,388
Just putting it out there...

158
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:26,330
I’d like to go.

159
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,517
I think we’re gonna go.

160
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:32,452
Is that alright?

161
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:41,034
Excuse us.

162
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:47,526
They’re talking, it’s their time,
and you have to respect that.

163
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:47,760
Come on.

164
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:50,633
I mean, you sit there for weeks and
you don’t say a word.

165
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,476
I’m sorry. I can’t stand the god-
freaks. You know that.

166
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,659
But they're not all like that.
Kevin and Gabby aren't.

167
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:58,049
No. Kevin and Gabby are
professional wallowers.

168
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:00,714
I mean come on? Eight years,
Howie.

169
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:04,514
Eight.
If that’s what you want to become, then...

170
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:06,026
Look, if you wanna take a break-

171
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:06,974
No, not a break, I'm done.

172
00:15:07,993 --> 00:15:09,578
I know the Izzy stuff got under
your skin

173
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:16,816
Please don't do that. One semester of Psychology
fifteen years ago and suddenly you can analyze

174
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:17,683
Well Jesus, Becca

175
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:21,372
I just don't like the group. I
gave it a try, and it's not for me.

176
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:24,432
Okay. It’s not for you.

177
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:26,704
Thank you.

178
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,556
Do you mind if we not eat here?
Nothing’s really jumping out at me.

179
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:05,456
Taz! Stop! Come here and eat!
Come on!

180
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:09,536
Sorry. He’s not really dangerous.

181
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,408
Hey, eat.

182
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:11,313
Just kinda dumb

183
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:13,473
No, I know. He’s my dog.

184
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:20,578
Oh, you’re Becca! Of course!
I should’ve recognized you. I’m Auggie.

185
00:17:21,914 --> 00:17:24,421
- Oh. Hi, Auggie.
- Hi

186
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:30,214
Oh my god, why didn't you tell me you were
coming over? I would've picked up the house.

187
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:32,359
That’s Auggie.

188
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:34,408
Yeah, we met. Is Izzy here?

189
00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:35,794
Oh yeah, she's here.

190
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:36,863
She got fired from the Applebee's.

191
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:45,027
I was planning to bring it all down to Goodwill,
but now I'm glad I didn't.

192
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:48,512
Look at all these shirts,
and the sweaters.

193
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:50,856
I don't know, Bec.
They're in babyclothes for so long

194
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:53,340
before he could even fit into that
stuff.

195
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,838
It comes up very quickly. You'll see.
You’re gonna be happy I saved them.

196
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,240
Is he living here?

197
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:01,738
He has to. His girlfriend kicked
him out.

198
00:18:01,738 --> 00:18:03,017
Ex-girlfriend.

199
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:04,284
She knew what I meant.

200
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,166
Did you see this one?

201
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,459
Cute.look at thay
But what if it's a girl?

202
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:14,511
I don't know, Then I'll give them to someone
else. You're gonna thank me.

203
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:18,183
A couple years worth of clothes here.
Think of the money you'll save.

204
00:18:18,183 --> 00:18:19,485
It's not about the money.

205
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:23,674
Well it should be. You need to
start thinking about that.

206
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:29,211
Especially if the dad's a musician.
It costs a lot to raise a child.

207
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:35,274
It'd be weird, Becca. If it's a boy.
To see him running around in Danny's clothes.

208
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,760
I would feel weird about it.

209
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,289
Yeah, I’m sorry. Of course it'd be
weird.

210
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:51,823
It was a nice offer.

211
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:57,361
You’re gonna get a lot of clothes anyway Christmas,
Birthdays. You won’t have to worry about that.

212
00:18:57,361 --> 00:19:00,239
It's probably a girl anyway. I'm a
little psychic about these things.

213
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:04,664
Remember I said Sheila was having a
girl? And Karen?

214
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,258
I think there's
a girl in there.

215
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:10,177
I hope there is. I mean i want a girl

216
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:13,248
i want as it's healthy obviously, but I
hope it's a girl.

217
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,698
Me too.

218
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:18,893
You want some coffee cake, honey?
I got some coffee cake in here.

219
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:22,755
I'm gonna take off. I promised
Howie that I'd pick up some dinner.

220
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:24,839
Mmm looks good though.

221
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:32,347
Here. Eat some cake.

222
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:41,186
When did Rick ever beat me in
squash?

223
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:43,720
Did he mention Debbie at all?

224
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:48,739
You can call her, you know. Get the
reports directly.

225
00:21:48,987 --> 00:21:50,360
I don’t wanna call her. She should
call me.

226
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:57,042
I would have been there for her if god forbid
anything had ever happened to Robby or Em.

227
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:03,477
I wouldn’t have vanished the way
she did.

228
00:22:07,837 --> 00:22:08,367
I wouldn’t.

229
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:10,967
Howie?

230
00:22:13,888 --> 00:22:14,696
You know what I mean?

231
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,370
Yeah.

232
00:22:47,862 --> 00:22:48,352
Howie.

233
00:22:54,859 --> 00:23:01,225
Turn around. Come on, you need to
relax.

234
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,613
You're shoulders are all knotted
up.

235
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:20,885
Yeah, well...

236
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:27,987
Forget about Debbie, and whatever
else is bothering you.

237
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:34,987
Ohhh, I see what this is. Dimmingthe lights

238
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:41,268
You’re trying to seduce me. Plyingme with liquor

239
00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:43,374
It worked in college.

240
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:44,852
That’s enough.

241
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:52,823
That's enough.

242
00:23:56,622 --> 00:23:57,431
Where are you going?

243
00:23:57,783 --> 00:24:01,826
I'm feeling kinda antsy tonight.
I’m sorry. It was a weird day...

244
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:05,414
Right.

245
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:07,066
What, now you’re gonna pout?

246
00:24:08,825 --> 00:24:09,808
Well it's been eight months.

247
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:11,286
But who's keeping track?

248
00:24:11,464 --> 00:24:12,410
I am. I'm keeping track.

249
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:22,057
I'm just not ready yet, Howie. I'm
sorry if you think that's abnormal

250
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:23,872
I don't.
I don't think that's normal at all but...

251
00:24:23,872 --> 00:24:25,143
Then what's the problem?

252
00:24:25,706 --> 00:24:28,731
We need to at least head in that direction,
which might feel strange at first, but...

253
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:29,927
But you wanna have sex

254
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:31,227
Well don't say it like that.

255
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,953
You’re trying to rope me into
having sex!

256
00:24:33,198 --> 00:24:35,095
I am not. I wasn't roping you into
sex-

257
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,288
Al Green isn't roping?

258
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:36,862
No.

259
00:24:36,862 --> 00:24:37,717
Al Green?

260
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:41,533
I thought it was nice. That's all.
I was trying to make things nice.

261
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:48,110
Well you can't.you just can't, I'm sorry.
Things aren't "nice" anymore

262
00:24:57,056 --> 00:24:58,955
And, will you hold him for a second?
Just hold him, just hold him like that.

263
00:24:58,955 --> 00:24:59,629
Dad, quit it!

264
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:00,323
Quit it.

265
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:02,245
Yeah, pull him past you. All right,
now.

266
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:04,396
Cause Taz wants to go on the tire

267
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:09,290
Okay, you ready? I’m gonna let you go.
Ready?

268
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,118
Yes.

269
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:15,055
Here goes. There! Whoa! Keepyour feet up.

270
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,087
Danny, look at me on the way back.

271
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:18,558
Keep your feet up, Danny.

272
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:43,174
Hey.

273
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,134
If you're not gonna go to Group, I
think you should see someone.

274
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:03,188
Any plans for the day?

275
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:05,021
You're looking at 'em.

276
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:09,153
Well, I’ll see you tonight.

277
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:10,225
Yup.

278
00:27:19,043 --> 00:27:22,172
Hi, I'm here to see Scott Bader in
the Events Department.

279
00:27:23,895 --> 00:27:25,794
I don't have a Bader listed.

280
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,255
Oh. Well that’s weird

281
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:32,796
Kate Finn. What about Kate?

282
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:35,715
I have a Robert Finn in Dec. Arts?

283
00:27:38,212 --> 00:27:41,449
If you have an appointment, I can
just call up there. Who are you?

284
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:46,195
Um... I’m just... I didn’t have an
appointment actually.

285
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:49,255
I'm just an
old friend. I used to work here.

286
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:50,311
Becca?

287
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:54,319
Gary?

288
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:56,010
Heeey. What are you doing here?

289
00:27:56,289 --> 00:28:01,987
Um... I had some errands in the city,
and thought I'd pop in and say hello.

290
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:03,641
But apparently nobody
works here anymore.

291
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:07,896
Oh yeah, Scott went over to
Christie's back in March. The traitor.

292
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:11,482
Well nice to see you’re still doing
the coffee runs at least.

293
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:14,577
Oh, no, I don’t usually-- Um, I’m
in Scott’s old job.

294
00:28:18,587 --> 00:28:19,254
Hey, how's the family?

295
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:25,200
You know what, Gary? I know how
busy it gets up there,

296
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:26,642
so I’m gonna
let you get back to it.

297
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,120
Yeah, that hasn't changed.

298
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:30,187
It was great to see you though

299
00:28:30,187 --> 00:28:31,256
Yeah, you too.

300
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:24,710
Well there are fines you know.

301
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:25,861
No, I know

302
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:28,954
The book’s quite overdue. We've
sent out several notices.

303
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,502
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

304
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:31,771
Seven dollars.

305
00:29:52,977 --> 00:29:53,785
Can I help you?

306
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:59,061
Uh, yes, actually. Would it be
possible for me to check this out?

307
00:30:01,136 --> 00:30:01,875
Certainly

308
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:13,937
"I will become a fish in a trout
stream and I will swim away from you.” Look he’s

309
00:30:15,695 --> 00:30:16,434
He's in the water.

310
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:22,960
Yes, he is, "If you become a fish
in the trout stream, said his mother

311
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,835
I will become a fisherman
and I will fish for you."

312
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:26,715
Oh! Sorry.

313
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:32,091
Hey.

314
00:30:32,443 --> 00:30:32,900
Hey.

315
00:30:33,428 --> 00:30:36,910
I just scored Yankee tickets offa
Rowan. Tonight. You interested?

316
00:30:38,914 --> 00:30:40,006
I can’t. I have Group.

317
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:43,979
You can't skip one night?
They'rebehind home plate.

318
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:47,074
Another time.

319
00:30:49,078 --> 00:30:50,696
If there is one.

320
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,618
Going stag tonight?

321
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:57,729
Uh, yeah.

322
00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:02,795
Becca's gonna... take a little
break. From the group.

323
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:06,103
I’m gonna get a coffee.

324
00:31:10,922 --> 00:31:11,308
Wanna sit?

325
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:12,678
Yeah.

326
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:19,923
Hello?

327
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:22,035
Hey Mom, it's me

328
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:23,057
What's wrong?

329
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:28,191
Nothing. I was just... thinking about making
Izzy's birthday cake. Would that be alright?

330
00:31:28,824 --> 00:31:30,509
Oh Honey, you don't need to do all
that.

331
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:34,454
I was just gonna grab her one of
those Carvel things. She likes those.

332
00:31:34,454 --> 00:31:38,315
I don't mind. It'll give me
something to do.

333
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:39,860
Okay then

334
00:31:40,954 --> 00:31:41,795
No group tonight?

335
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:46,013
Howie's there. It's too much God
talk for me, so...

336
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:50,935
What.

337
00:31:51,712 --> 00:31:55,613
Nothing. It’s just... some people
find that comforting.

338
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,593
Yeah, well, it pisses me off.

339
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:01,744
You know, Becca, when your brother
died, I found the church very helpful.

340
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:08,179
I know you did, but that's you, not
me. And Danny isn’t Arthur.

341
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:10,720
I know, brought you to
church every Sunday-

342
00:32:11,001 --> 00:32:17,472
Let’s not start this again, okaymom?
I was just calling about the cake..

343
00:32:17,793 --> 00:32:21,555
You’re not right about everything,
you know. What if there is a God?

344
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:24,263
Then I’d say he's a sadistic prick.

345
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:25,740
Alright, Becca. That’s enough.

346
00:32:26,057 --> 00:32:27,710
"Worship me and I'll treat you like
shit."

347
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,493
No wonder you like him, he
sounds just like Dad.

348
00:32:38,964 --> 00:32:39,315
I'm sorry.

349
00:32:43,888 --> 00:32:45,257
You're gonna do the cake then?

350
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:46,911
Yeah.

351
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:51,380
Right, I'll see you tomorrow.

352
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,656
Who has a birthday party at a
bowling alley anyway?

353
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,347
Izzy thinksshe's still fourteen.

354
00:33:00,872 --> 00:33:02,770
If you’re not up to this we don’t
have to go..

355
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:05,761
No, it’s just a party. I’ll be
fine.

356
00:33:12,336 --> 00:33:14,587
I really wish you’d take that out
of here, Howie.

357
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:18,280
You’re hardly in this car, what’s
the difference?

358
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,370
It’s just weird.

359
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:25,237
What if we give it another try?

360
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,771
- Another baby?
- What

361
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:31,183
Well we’re not getting any younger.

362
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:32,908
Is that what the sex thing was
about the other night?

363
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,998
No-

364
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,403
You trying to get me pregnant?

365
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:40,854
Becca, no, of course not. I know
it's scary, but maybe it might..

366
00:33:42,612 --> 00:33:43,595
Help us get us back on track.

367
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:44,863
On track?

368
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:46,411
What, we can’t talk about it?

369
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:50,629
I think we should sell the house.

370
00:33:51,227 --> 00:33:52,667
I've been thinking about it, and
since we're on the topic...

371
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:54,938
what you mean How were we on the topic?

372
00:33:54,938 --> 00:34:00,017
I’ve talked to a realtor and she thinks we can
pull together an open house pretty quickly

373
00:34:00,335 --> 00:34:02,783
why would you talked to a
realtor without telling me?

374
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:04,178
I’m telling you now.

375
00:34:05,371 --> 00:34:08,078
You want to get us back on track, I
think it'd help if we moved.

376
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,099
We love that house.

377
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,579
He's everywhere, Howie. The puzzles,
the fingerprints on the door jambs

378
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,057
I like seeing his fingerprints

379
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:17,360
That’s because you don’t have to
sit and stare at them all day.

380
00:34:17,573 --> 00:34:18,907
You get to go to work.
You get to escape!

381
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:19,998
I don’t want to move!

382
00:34:20,244 --> 00:34:21,089
And I don’t want another baby!

383
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:22,283
Jesus!

384
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:29,753
What are you doing?

385
00:34:29,753 --> 00:34:33,733
What do you think I’m doing? I’m
checking the cake. It’s fine.

386
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:43,333
Are you kidding? The Kennedys?
With the assassinations... the lobotomy...?!

387
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:49,274
Yeah, but that’s not a curse
though. That's just bad luck.

388
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:50,469
The plane crashes?

389
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:57,080
Too much money, that's their curse.
If those Kennedys lived like normal people

390
00:34:57,538 --> 00:34:58,944
most of them would still be alive.

391
00:34:59,588 --> 00:35:00,590
I think it’s sad.

392
00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:04,620
All those goodlooking people
falling out of the sky like that.

393
00:35:05,149 --> 00:35:06,588
It’s a friggin’ waste.

394
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:08,067
Didn't I say no wine?

395
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:09,263
She brought it herself

396
00:35:09,754 --> 00:35:15,348
Isn’t this nice? Sitting aroundtalking politics?
I never do this. It’s a nice change.

397
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:16,894
Let’s do gifts.

398
00:35:17,351 --> 00:35:18,793
Yes! Pass em!

399
00:35:19,355 --> 00:35:22,238
Okay. It’s heavy.

400
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,686
It’s so pretty. I hate to rip it open.

401
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:31,629
It's a bathroom set.

402
00:35:33,878 --> 00:35:34,723
It's more of a practical gift

403
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:39,541
Is this your way of telling me you
don't like my Three Stooges shower curtain?

404
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,460
I didn't know what to get you.

405
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,113
Seriously, this is great.

406
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:45,516
Say thank you.

407
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:47,729
Thank you, Becca. Thank you,
Howie.

408
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,909
Don't thank me, Becca picked it
out

409
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:51,679
Okay, now me.

410
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,743
I know it’s a little early but-

411
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:03,705
Oh, my God! So sweet. Thank you,
Mommy.

412
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:09,755
I thought we weren't doing baby
stuff. For the birthday.

413
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:12,673
I thought we'd wait for the shower

414
00:36:13,094 --> 00:36:16,153
No honey, it's not baby stuff, it's
mommy stuff.

415
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:18,229
This is perfect, Bec. I needed a
bathroom set.

416
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:20,109
Yeah, but you need baby stuff more.

417
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:22,427
We can take it back

418
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,186
That's right, we should. I'll getyou a basket
of Mustela lotions. They prevent stretch marks...

419
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,470
Becca, let go. You can get me the
lotions another time.

420
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:32,360
You can get me the
lotions another time.

421
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,477
Thank you.

422
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:45,755
Here.

423
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:57,184
Oh, I just remembered what I was
gonna say about Aristotle Onassis!

424
00:36:57,709 --> 00:37:01,507
It was about the son who died in
the plane crash!

425
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,390
- You ready to go?
- Yeah

426
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,107
You should’ve stopped me from going
off on that Kennedy stuff,

427
00:37:06,387 --> 00:37:10,747
because my point was about
Onassis and how he put up a reward

428
00:37:11,274 --> 00:37:15,493
to anyone who could prove that
someone had sabotaged his son’s plane.

429
00:37:16,022 --> 00:37:18,166
He was so desperate to blame somebody.

430
00:37:18,729 --> 00:37:19,747
Did you read this?

431
00:37:23,268 --> 00:37:25,272
He needed a reason for losing his
son.

432
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:26,925
Mom, why are you telling this
story?

433
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:28,983
I'm just talking. I can't talk?

434
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,057
You never just talk.

435
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:34,188
Thank you guys for coming to my
party. Becca the cake was so good.

436
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,436
You forget what I went through when
your brother died.

437
00:37:36,823 --> 00:37:39,180
You think I don't know anything,
but I do Becca!

438
00:37:39,495 --> 00:37:40,376
Like who to blame?

439
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:42,873
You guys, this is my party.

440
00:37:43,118 --> 00:37:44,207
Let em’ go. That’s not on you.

441
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:48,041
I'm not talking about blame, I'm
talking about comfort.

442
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:49,166
Ohhh, comfort. Well then.

443
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,367
Where are you getting it?

444
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:51,434
Comfort? I'm not.

445
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:52,645
Well I think you should.

446
00:37:52,891 --> 00:37:55,319
Okay. I'll get right on that then.
See what I can dig up on eBay.

447
00:37:55,565 --> 00:38:01,225
I'm just trying to help you, Becca. I wish someone
had given me a little advice when Arthur died.

448
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:06,808
You know what I wish? I wish you would stop comparing
Danny to Arthur! Danny was a four-year-old

449
00:38:06,808 --> 00:38:08,284
boy who chased his dog into the
street!

450
00:38:08,284 --> 00:38:11,790
Arthur was a thirty-yearold
heroin addict who OD’d!

451
00:38:12,383 --> 00:38:15,396
Frankly I resent how you keep
lumping them together!

452
00:38:15,818 --> 00:38:17,331
He was still my son.

453
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,278
We’re gonna go. Izzy,
I hope you enjoy the bathroom set.

454
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,474
I'm gonna.

455
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:49,403
When Arthur died, I was just as upset as she was,
but I never took it out on other people.

456
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:52,780
What about Mrs. Bailey?

457
00:38:54,843 --> 00:38:57,479
Nobody's talking about Mrs. Bailey!

458
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:28,306
Hey, did you call that guy about
the roof?

459
00:39:28,762 --> 00:39:30,099
I couldn’t find the number.

460
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:35,267
It’s in my phone. It’s on the
mantle.

461
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:39,485
What’s his name?

462
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,459
It’s not under his name.

463
00:39:45,604 --> 00:39:47,292
Then how am I supposed to call him if I--?

464
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:49,330
It’s under Roof Guy.

465
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:51,229
Roof Guy.

466
00:39:52,918 --> 00:39:54,428
Well what was I supposed to put itunder.

467
00:39:56,362 --> 00:39:58,167
I don’t know how to use this thing.

468
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,109
It doesn’t--

469
00:40:03,538 --> 00:40:05,324
Okay, now scroll down.

470
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:06,491
Now what?

471
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:07,080
Scroll down with your finger.

472
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,102
You do it.

473
00:40:13,097 --> 00:40:14,020
Roof guy.

474
00:40:14,573 --> 00:40:15,557
Thank you.

475
00:40:34,507 --> 00:40:35,312
Are you waiting for me?

476
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:42,836
Oh. Um, hi. Yeah, I... I'm sorry,
I thought you took the bus.

477
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,088
I do

478
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,425
Right. But not...?

479
00:40:47,795 --> 00:40:49,307
Not today, no. Today I skipped
school.

480
00:40:51,008 --> 00:40:53,015
...you shouldn't be playing hooky,
young man.

481
00:40:57,973 --> 00:40:59,379
Why are you waiting for me?

482
00:41:03,248 --> 00:41:04,198
I thought we could talk?

483
00:41:06,484 --> 00:41:07,117
About what?

484
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,554
Is this okay?

485
00:41:15,169 --> 00:41:16,119
Yeah. It’s fine.

486
00:41:18,056 --> 00:41:18,932
It's not too weird?

487
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:23,013
Um, no. I mean...

488
00:41:25,476 --> 00:41:30,048
No, I know. It’s weird for me too.

489
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,148
Don’t you like school?

490
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:36,940
I like it alright.

491
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,917
Okay. I just thought, you seem to
not be going so

492
00:41:41,337 --> 00:41:43,940
I’ve been accepted to college
already, so...

493
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:46,997
Oh. So it’s not a big deal then.

494
00:41:46,997 --> 00:41:50,799
No, it is a big deal, but... only if
my mother finds out.

495
00:41:52,573 --> 00:41:54,578
She said she’d confiscate my phone
if I did it again.

496
00:41:55,994 --> 00:41:58,273
Not that I use the phone anyway.

497
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:59,853
Where are you headed?

498
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:00,910
Connecticut College.

499
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:07,557
That's a good school. And not too
far. I bet you parent pleased to you

500
00:42:09,712 --> 00:42:12,387
It's just my mom, but yeah, she's
pretty happy about it.

501
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:15,704
She keeps saying she's gonna apply
to the grad program

502
00:42:15,704 --> 00:42:17,293
so she can keep
an eye on me while I'm up there.

503
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,330
She's just joking though.

504
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,169
She's not really looking forward to
it, since I'm the only one at home now,

505
00:42:24,595 --> 00:42:27,654
but I told her I'd come back
on the weekends if I could.

506
00:42:30,364 --> 00:42:31,278
That'll be nice.

507
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:43,795
So, I'm sorry.

508
00:42:46,466 --> 00:42:51,074
Oh, I know, you don't have to...

509
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:52,412
I know that doesn't help, but...

510
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:54,312
No it does. It really does.

511
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:55,824
And I know I should’ve tried to get
in touch

512
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:56,951
No, it’s fine.

513
00:42:59,694 --> 00:43:01,885
I just really wish I had driven
down a different block that day

514
00:43:05,173 --> 00:43:05,879
I know

515
00:43:13,197 --> 00:43:14,436
You know what? I should maybe go

516
00:43:16,572 --> 00:43:17,310
It’s alright.

517
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:21,117
My mom’s gonna start to wonder
where I’m at

518
00:43:21,117 --> 00:43:23,362
That's okay. You really don’t have to

519
00:43:27,935 --> 00:43:28,847
Could we do this again sometime?

520
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:34,148
Sure.

521
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:16,421
Jesus Christ!

522
00:44:17,231 --> 00:44:18,143
Hey, Gabby

523
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:20,571
I can’t believe you just saw me do
that.

524
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:24,930
I didn’t mean to sneak up on you.
I thought something was wrong.

525
00:44:25,422 --> 00:44:28,201
But
obviously everything... smells fine.

526
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:29,994
You can smell it huh?

527
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,514
God, everyone in there is gonna
know. I swear I never do this.

528
00:44:39,533 --> 00:44:40,340
Where’s Kevin?

529
00:44:41,184 --> 00:44:45,651
He’s not coming to group. And I
blame your wife by the way.

530
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:47,938
I think she put the idea in his head.

531
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:51,031
Well, he didn’t seem to really like
group all that much.

532
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:55,756
He’s gotten me all upset. I mean,
look at me.

533
00:44:58,101 --> 00:45:01,101
I am Smoking pot in a
parking lot.

534
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:03,153
It’s like I’m in highschool.
I’m ridiculous.

535
00:45:04,054 --> 00:45:05,107
Do you have any more?

536
00:45:08,905 --> 00:45:12,316
Yeah! Come on in, partner!

537
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:17,045
Well if today is rage day,

538
00:45:20,091 --> 00:45:24,804
most of you know that I am a little more
comfortable with rage.

539
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,363
Talking about rage.
I deal with rage every single day.

540
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:36,150
And I listen to these guys at work,
and they go on and on about

541
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:40,544
paving their driveways

542
00:45:41,037 --> 00:45:45,714
or whatever, just the most stupid
nonsense. They don’t know.

543
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,992
They haven’t had their
lives ripped apart yet.

544
00:45:51,801 --> 00:45:52,997
They’re not in the club.

545
00:45:53,276 --> 00:46:01,549
Exactly. Meanwhile, I’m sitting there like,
“Hey guys, my daughter died of leukemia--!”

546
00:46:04,997 --> 00:46:05,841
I’m sorry, I need some water

547
00:46:14,808 --> 00:46:18,045
You’re one of those bad kids my
mother warned me about.

548
00:46:18,607 --> 00:46:21,069
Yes, I am corrupting you.

549
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:23,284
Don’t worry, I won’t tell Becca.

550
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:25,832
I’d appreciate that.

551
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,786
- Good night.
- Good night.

552
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:42,700
Becca

553
00:46:42,735 --> 00:46:43,209
Becca

554
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:44,167
What'd you do here?

555
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:45,055
What?

556
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:48,217
Goddamn it, what did you do to my
phone?

557
00:46:48,499 --> 00:46:51,277
Jesus, Howie. I thought something
had hap

558
00:46:51,523 --> 00:46:53,669
This morning. When you used it.
What did you do to my phone?

559
00:46:53,986 --> 00:46:57,221
Nothing. I just got the number for
the roof guy.

560
00:46:57,501 --> 00:46:58,487
For christsake!

561
00:46:58,733 --> 00:46:59,612
What, you told me to call him.

562
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:00,744
You deleted Danny's video.

563
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:06,434
No, no I didn't. No. I just...
you were right there. I just got the number.

564
00:47:06,717 --> 00:47:08,579
Yeah, and you kept pressing the
screen.

565
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:11,393
Because I couldn't figure out how
to use your phone.

566
00:47:11,638 --> 00:47:12,800
I checked already. It's gone.

567
00:47:13,011 --> 00:47:14,174
We have a hundred videos of him,
Howie.

568
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:15,438
That's not the point, Becca.

569
00:47:15,684 --> 00:47:17,618
Then you should've put it on your
computer.

570
00:47:17,828 --> 00:47:18,813
Right, it's my fault.

571
00:47:19,938 --> 00:47:20,819
I didn't say that.

572
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:22,613
I said it's gone!

573
00:47:22,893 --> 00:47:24,792
Jesus, Howie! I didn't do it on
purpose!

574
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:25,637
Are you sure?

575
00:47:26,728 --> 00:47:27,464
What does that mean?

576
00:47:27,747 --> 00:47:29,751
You think I deliberately deleted
his video?

577
00:47:29,998 --> 00:47:30,631
I don't know

578
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:32,986
You don't know?

579
00:47:33,304 --> 00:47:36,576
It’s like you’re trying to get rid of him.
I'm sorry, but that's how it feels.

580
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:37,984
Every day, it's
something new.

581
00:47:38,263 --> 00:47:39,000
Really.

582
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:42,201
Yeah. It’s like you're trying to get rid
of any evidence he was ever here.

583
00:47:43,713 --> 00:47:45,225
You took his paintings off
the fridge.

584
00:47:45,507 --> 00:47:48,004
Yes, to save them. They are in a
box downstairs.

585
00:47:48,286 --> 00:47:49,059
His clothes?

586
00:47:49,306 --> 00:47:50,641
We don’t need all that stuff.

587
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,404
Your wanting to sell the house.
Your sending Taz to your mother's.

588
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:56,691
There was a lot going on, Howie.
The dog got under foot.

589
00:47:56,903 --> 00:47:58,272
Right. And he was a reminder.

590
00:47:58,555 --> 00:48:00,882
Yes, he was a reminder,
and I wanted one less reminder around here.

591
00:48:00,882 --> 00:48:02,187
And since you never wanted the dog.

592
00:48:02,187 --> 00:48:03,072
Oh, for godssake

593
00:48:03,072 --> 00:48:05,851
Well if I hadn't bought the dog
danny whould still alive

594
00:48:05,851 --> 00:48:09,764
And if I hadn't run in to get the
phone or if I had latched the gate

595
00:48:10,043 --> 00:48:11,064
I left the gate unlatched!

596
00:48:11,275 --> 00:48:15,753
Well I didn’t check it! I’m not playing this
game again Howie. It was no one’s fault.

597
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:20,128
Not even the dog's.
Dogs chasesquirrels, boys chase dogs.

598
00:48:20,128 --> 00:48:20,912
I know that

599
00:48:20,912 --> 00:48:22,818
He loved that dog! And you got rid
of it!

600
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:24,671
Just like I got rid of the video.

601
00:48:24,671 --> 00:48:28,192
It's not just the video! I'm not
talking about the video, Becca!

602
00:48:28,192 --> 00:48:32,146
It's about Taz, and the paintings, and
the clothes, and it's everything!

603
00:48:32,053 --> 00:48:36,808
The is no pictures in all that around

604
00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:40,416
You have to stop erasing him! You
have to stop it!

605
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:44,737
Do you really think I don't
see him every second of every day?

606
00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:50,681
The video was an accident, Howie.
And believe me,

607
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,740
I’ll beat myself up
about it forever, I'm sure.

608
00:48:53,991 --> 00:48:55,643
Just like everything else that I could've prevented.

609
00:48:55,851 --> 00:48:56,834
That's not what I want, Becca.

610
00:48:57,047 --> 00:49:01,302
No? Because it feels like it is.
It feels like maybe I don't feel badly enough for you.

611
00:49:01,303 --> 00:49:04,756
Maybe i am not feelling enough
What do you want from me?

612
00:49:09,695 --> 00:49:11,473
I m just got to change

613
00:49:12,387 --> 00:49:23,557
Because I can't do this... like this.
It's too hard. It's too hard.

614
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,070
And I want that dog back. Your
mother's making him fat.

615
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:40,280
I miss the dog. I'm sorry, but Imiss him.
I want him back.

616
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:12,006
You really made these?

617
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:13,095
I did

618
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:20,278
They're good. Still warm.

619
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,138
I'm glad you like them

620
00:50:30,192 --> 00:50:33,255
So I've been reading that book.
The parallel universe book?

621
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:37,686
Yeah? Did you like it?

622
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,600
Yeah, it’s interesting. I don’t
know if I buy it.

623
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,700
The whole
alternate reality thing

624
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,200
I don’t
know

625
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,300
But it’s interesting.

626
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,200
Did
you have to do it for a school

627
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,000
No. It's research.

628
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,900
Oh. Research.

629
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,100
It's a comic book.

630
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,300
Impressive.

631
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,000
- You did all this?
- Yeah.

632
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,400
Wow. It’s amazing

633
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,800
What's it
about?

634
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,400
A scientist, I guess. And his son.

635
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,400
The father discovers this network of holes
that leads to other galaxies and, um

636
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,700
Parallel universes.

637
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,500
Yeah

638
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,200
Yeah, but the scientist dies. So
the son has to go

639
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,900
into this rabbit hole
to try and find him.

640
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,000
But it’s not
him, because he's dead,

641
00:51:47,035 --> 00:51:49,700
so it’s like another version of him.

642
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,200
- I know it's kinda stupid, but...
- No.

643
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,400
No? Okay.

644
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,200
Not at all. I would love to read
it.

645
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,200
Yeah it’s um...

646
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,100
it’s not done
yet

647
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,800
But when it is done, I will
let you read it.

648
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,100
- Okay.
- Okay.

649
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,500
I don't want you to feel
uncomfortable.

650
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
- I...
- I might've been going too fast....

651
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
That day.

652
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,700
I'm not sure, but I might’ve been.
So... that's something I've been wanting to tell you.

653
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,500
It's a thirty zone. And I might've
been going thirty-one.

654
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,200
Or thirty-two.

655
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,600
I would usually look down, to check, and if I
was a little over, then I'd slow down obviously.

656
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,400
But...

657
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,000
I don't remember checking on your
block,

658
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,200
so it's possible I was going
too fast.

659
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,300
And ..

660
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,900
The dog ran out
really fast

661
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,400
so I swerved

662
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,700
I didn’t know

663
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,800
I didn’t know

664
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,700
I thought you should know

665
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,800
I might've been going a little over the limit.

666
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,700
I can't be positive.

667
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,300
- It’s okay.
- Okay.

668
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
Well.

669
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,500
I know, okay?

670
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,600
Thank you.

671
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,700
I don't wanna go in there.

672
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,400
Yes, yes!

673
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,200
Sorry. I was...

674
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,400
Take care.

675
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,600
Oh, come on!

676
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,900
I’m sorry, you suck...

677
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,700
I’d be doing better but your pot
messed up my depth perception.

678
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,100
All right.

679
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,400
I’m gonna support that one. I’m
totally gonna support that one.

680
00:55:09,435 --> 00:55:10,300
Thanks.

681
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,300
Hey you know what. I have a
confession to make.

682
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,800
Remember when I
said Kevin left Group?

683
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,100
Yes.

684
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,200
What I meant to say..

685
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,100
Is that heleft me. He left me.

686
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,600
I left myself.

687
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,200
Yes...

688
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,100
I came home and was gone.

689
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,565
Wow. No note or...

690
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,300
Oh there was a note.

691
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:51,400
Well, not a
note so much as a manifesto.

692
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,100
On all the ways that we were destroying each other.

693
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,600
Jesus. I'm sorry.

694
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,500
Well... this is generally how it
goes, right?

695
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,500
It changes you.

696
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,400
It
literally changes people.

697
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:16,000
You know, Part of
me thinks it was inevitable.

698
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,400
I love my wife.

699
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:26,900
Of course you do

700
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,100
I love her very much.

701
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,200
Okay.

702
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,900
So I think you're right. We should
maybe...

703
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,700
look into selling the house.

704
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,400
It's probably for the best.

705
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,500
Okay.

706
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Don't do that

707
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,200
Quick and clean, like a band-aid.
Or we'll never get through this

708
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,100
Here.

709
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,100
<i>Hey, kid.
Welcome to light up apple</i>

710
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,000
I don't know how to turn it off.

711
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,800
Only people without children give
gifts like this.

712
00:57:45,835 --> 00:57:47,700
<i>Come on!
Goodbye.</i>

713
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,065
Goodbye.

714
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,600
<i>I hope you'll visiting us soon.</i>

715
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,900
- Have you heard from Debbie yet?
- No.

716
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,900
That's too bad.

717
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,200
But it can be
worse the other way,

718
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,200
you know. I
remember when Arthur died...

719
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,100
You can say his name.

720
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,100
- Can I?
- Yes.

721
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,200
Do not know your rules.
I don't wanna get scolded again.

722
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,300
You can talk about Arthur.
I justdon't like the comparisons.

723
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,600
Okay.

724
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,800
So how is it worse?

725
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,200
- You remember Maureen Bailey?
- Yes.

726
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,200
Well...

727
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,000
I couldn't get rid of her after
your brother passed away.

728
00:58:31,035 --> 00:58:33,300
- She was always at the house
- Yeah, I remember that.

729
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,700
Yeah well, I never had a moment to
myself.

730
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,300
So finally in the middle
of coffee one afternoon, I said,

731
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,700
"Maureen, why are you always here?"

732
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,900
What'd she say?

733
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,600
She said, "I wanna be there, Nat, I
wanna share in your grief."

734
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,900
And so
I said "Well it's not working.

735
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,100
You plant your fat ass in that chair
every frickin' day"

736
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,800
- You did not say that!
- I did!

737
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,565
- Mom!
- I said that.

738
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,300
- You said "fat ass"?
- "You suck up all my coffee.

739
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:03,000
And I don't see you leaving with any
of this grief you're allegedly sharing with me.

740
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:06,000
In fact the only thing you do take outta
here are my cinnamon buns."

741
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,800
So I never saw her again obviously.

742
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,700
Oh my God, I can not believe it.

743
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,500
I feel guilty now.

744
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,700
- You do not.
- I do.

745
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,000
You’re right, I don’t.

746
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,000
I don’t
miss her at all.

747
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,200
Okay, we will be alright.

748
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,100
That takes care of Taz.

749
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,500
Ah, the ol' apple pie trick, eh?

750
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,200
What?

751
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,300
For the Open House.

752
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,200
Warm baked
goods makes it feel homier.

753
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,900
No, just making a pie.

754
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,000
I thought you were doing it for the
Open House.

755
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,700
So...

756
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,300
- now you’re not gonna stay?
- Oh, no. No.

757
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,200
You shouldn't either

758
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,500
- You shouldn’t
- Come on,...

759
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,900
I'm not gonna bother
anyone.

760
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,600
So we have the garbage cans in the
back, the sign out front.

761
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,000
I mowed
the lawn.

762
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,100
I thought we’d set the
sign-in sheet here

763
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,900
and they could
move into the living room.

764
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,400
That's fine.

765
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,800
My wife's gonna go hide out, but
I'll stick around

766
01:00:27,835 --> 01:00:28,700
if that's okay
with you.

767
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,800
Sure. However you want to do it.

768
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,400
- Okay. Perfect.
- All right...

769
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,800
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

770
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,000
I think that’s everything.

771
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,400
- I know...
- Southwestern exposures.

772
01:01:09,435 --> 01:01:10,500
Sun all day..

773
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,200
- Why don’t we take a look upstairs?
- That’s a great idea. I’ll show you.

774
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,400
- Okay.
- Follow me.

775
01:01:16,435 --> 01:01:17,300
Come on, baby.

776
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:21,100
It is the largest part in the neighborhood.

777
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,200
We can start in the master bedroom
if you want to see

778
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,500
Wait. What’s in here?

779
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,100
Oh,

780
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,100
This is... This is...

781
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,200
This could be a good room for the
little guy, obviously

782
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,000
How about that, buddy? You like
this room?

783
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,700
- Oo, careful with that.
- That's not yours, honey.

784
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,100
- Thanks.
How old's your son?

785
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,400
This is your son's room, I assume?

786
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,800
Uh, yeah. I mean... it was,

787
01:01:50,835 --> 01:01:51,800
It was his room.

788
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,150
But... he died.

789
01:01:53,185 --> 01:01:54,400
He died...

790
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,600
Yeah, a car. Right out front

791
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,300
Oh my god.

792
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,500
- I’m so sorry..
- Thank you.

793
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,500
This must be so difficult for you.

794
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,065
It is,...

795
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,100
It's pretty weird.

796
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,800
It is strange that yet...

797
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,065
I still
forget he's not here sometimes.

798
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,200
Maybe he's just hiding under the bed and
he's gonna pop out. That’s what he used to do

799
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,600
But...

800
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,300
I still feel him here.

801
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,700
- Would you like to see the master bedroom?
- Yes.

802
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,800
Yes.

803
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,100
Yes.

804
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,600
Yeah, I’ll be there.

805
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,300
- Who was that?
- Becca.

806
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,000
She wants to “hang out.”

807
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,800
This was a good idea.

808
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,700
I know. I feel like a big ole
balloon

809
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,800
You're starting to show so early.

810
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,200
Yes, I know. I feel like a balloon.

811
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,900
I swear, once this kid is
born I’m going right to the gym.

812
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,200
While Mom watches the baby

813
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
What does that mean?
“While Mom watches the baby.”

814
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,200
While you're at the gym, Mom can
watch the baby.

815
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,700
She loves that.

816
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,500
No, Auggie can watch the baby. He
works nights, so he'll be home.

817
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,800
Okay. Auggie, then.

818
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,800
I resent the feeling I get from you
that I don't deserve the baby.

819
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,265
I'm not mature enough
or smart inough to take care of him.

820
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,000
I mean, my god, if Mom
could do it, how hard could it be?

821
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,700
- This alright?
- Yeah, it’s fine.

822
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,600
I’ve just gotta pick up a few
things and then we can do lunch.

823
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,000
Okay. Well

824
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:43,300
i want strawberry

825
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:47,165
Mommy, vPlease can
I have some Fruit Roll-Ups?

826
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,600
- No, Sammy, you know the answer
- Please?

827
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,600
- Can I have some, please?
- Sammy, no.

828
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,900
- I want the Fruit Roll-ups.
- Not happening.

829
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,300
- Please, I’ll be good.
- Stop it...

830
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,465
- Please?
- No.

831
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,900
- I promise.
- No, I’m not gonna get ‘em.

832
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,100
You know what? It's only threebucks,
why don't you just get him the roll-ups?

833
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,900
Not that it's any of your business,

834
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,700
but we don't allow candy in our house

835
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,100
- and my son knows that
- Come on, it’s just fruit

836
01:04:14,135 --> 01:04:15,400
Why don’t
you give him a treat?

837
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,300
Are you a mom?

838
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,700
Yeah, I didn’t think so.

839
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:20,600
Excuse me....

840
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,700
Go to the car, Becca.
I said go to the car.

841
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,300
It's okay.

842
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:33,200
She just lost her son eight months
ago and she’s...

843
01:04:33,235 --> 01:04:34,223
I don’t care.

844
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,600
Everything is okay.

845
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,200
Hey, hey.

846
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:48,700
Hey.

847
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,300
Fun day out?

848
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,400
How'd it go here?

849
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,400
Not so good

850
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,400
We need to clean out
that room.

851
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,165
Okay

852
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,700
Maybe make it into a guest room or
something.

853
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,700
Don't get any ideas.

854
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,300
Jesus...

855
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,500
Hello

856
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,800
The door was wide
open so...

857
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,300
And I knocked, but...

858
01:05:27,335 --> 01:05:28,200
Taz! Shut up!

859
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,000
I saw the sign outside..
So I thought it’d be okay to-

860
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,500
- You looking to buy a house?
- Howie...

861
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:35,800
No.

862
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,665
No, I just came to give you this.

863
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,000
I said I'd let you read it when it was done, so...

864
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:48,900
What... what is this?

865
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,400
Thank you.

866
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,900
We... bumped into each other, in the
library

867
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,800
and i. .. And i. ..

868
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,700
And we decided to meet.

869
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:06,500
You decided to meet?

870
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,365
Yes.

871
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,600
A couple times.

872
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,500
- Well...
- I'm sorry. I didn't realize...

873
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,100
It is...

874
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,300
Did you meet here?

875
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,400
No, we met in the park

876
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
You met in the park a couple times.

877
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,400
Yes.

878
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,600
So my wife...

879
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,700
agrees to meet you in a
public place, and you..

880
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,700
And you... Apologize?

881
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,500
- I guess.
- You guess

882
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,900
Well...

883
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,200
Okay, you apologize, and then what?

884
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,650
Alright, Howie, that's enough

885
01:06:44,685 --> 01:06:45,800
- And then what?
- It is enough.

886
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,000
- Look at me.
- Howie, that's enough.

887
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,100
- What is that?
- It's a comic book.

888
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,800
It is a comic book?

889
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,300
A comic book?

890
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,900
Did she tell you to bring it here?

891
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,900
- No, she didn't.
- No, she didn't.

892
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,900
Because this is our house.

893
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,700
And just because there's a sign
out front doesn't mean you can pop in.

894
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,550
Howie, all right.

895
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:06,100
No it’s not alright

896
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,600
You don't just
walk into someone's home like that.

897
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,000
You should show a little fucking
respect.

898
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,200
All right i go

899
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,500
You're an asshole.

900
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,865
Wait!

901
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,800
Jason, wait a minute. I m Sorry.

902
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,700
I am an asshole!

903
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,700
Taz, stop it.

904
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,400
Taz!

905
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,400
Taz.

906
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,700
Taz, stop it.

907
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,600
Oh, buddy..

908
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,000
Why didn’t you tell me?

909
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,200
For the same reason you don’t tell
me why you come home reeking of pot.

910
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,500
Does it ever go away?

911
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:30,700
No.

912
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:36,300
I don't think it does. Not for me it
hasn't. And that's goin'on eleven years.

913
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,400
It changes though.

914
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,000
How?

915
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,500
I don't know.

916
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,700
I don't know. The weight of it, I guess.

917
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,700
At some point it becomes
bearable

918
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:02,000
It turns into something
you can crawl out from under

919
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,800
and carry around
like a brick in your pocket.

920
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
And you even forget it

921
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,300
for while. But then you reach
in for whatever reason and i. ..

922
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:18,900
"Oh right.

923
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,000
Which can
be awful

924
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:24,800
But not all the time

925
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,800
Sometimes it's kinda.

926
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,000
Not that you like it exactly, but it's what
you have instead of your son

927
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,600
So you carry it around

928
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,500
And it doesn't go away

929
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,600
which is..

930
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,900
What is it?

931
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,200
Fine... actually.

932
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,300
- Hello?
- Hi.

933
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,600
Hey, it's Howie.

934
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,700
Howie Corbett. From Group?

935
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,700
Hi, Howie.

936
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,200
Here we go buddy

937
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,900
- Hey.
- Hi.

938
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,800
- You're going to group?
- Yeah. You didn't want to come, did you?

939
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
No.

940
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,500
<i>I'm Jason. Please leave a message.</i>

941
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,400
Did you find the house okay?

942
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,500
Howie?

943
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,300
Sorry.

944
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,500
Becca?

945
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,100
Becca?

946
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:55,600
Becca!

947
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:00,900
Becca!

948
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,100
God.

949
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,400
Sorry.

950
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,900
What time is it?

951
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,500
Almost six.

952
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,500
And you're just getting home?

953
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,400
So how was it?

954
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,400
It was okay.


955
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,300
- Well you look nice.
- Thank you.

956
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,700
Was that your girlfriend?

957
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,800
Just a friend.

958
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,500
She's pretty.

959
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:04,900
Yes.

960
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,500
She's pretty.

961
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,500
Well, I liked this so much. It’s
beautiful.

962
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,100
- It's wonderful.
- Thanks. Thanks.

963
01:19:17,135 --> 01:19:20,600
It reminded me of Orpheus and
Eurydice.

964
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,800
- Do you know that myth?
- No.

965
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,700
Eurydice dies, and Orpheus misses
her so much

966
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,600
that he travels to Hades to retrieve her,
but in the end it doesn't work out.

967
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,500
I should read it

968
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,600
So, is the scientist your dad?

969
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,200
The scientist the boy is looking
for...

970
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:46,800
No.

971
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,400
Is it based on him?

972
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,700
No. My dad was an English teacher

973
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,500
Oh. Okay. I was curious about that

974
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,400
It's just a story.

975
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:58,700
- No, I know. I was just...
- Reading into it?

976
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,600
Do you think they're real?

977
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,400
Parallel universes?

978
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,000
I think it’s basic science.

979
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,500
You know, If space is infinite,
then everything is possible.

980
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,400
So somewhere out there,
i m what?... making pancakes?

981
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,200
- Or at a water park?
- Sure. Yes.

982
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,600
- Yes?
- Yes. Both, Wherever.

983
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,100
I think... you know, Laws of
probability.

984
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:38,800
There are tons of
you's out there, and tons of me's

985
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:40,865
Yes...

986
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:43,200
So this is just the sad version of us.

987
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,500
Yes, I guess

988
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,300
But there are other versions

989
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:51,200
where everything goes our way.

990
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,100
Assuming you believe in science.

991
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,600
I like that thought.

992
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,600
It's nice.

993
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,600
Somewhere out there I'm having a
good time.

994
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,300
I thought maybe you had left.

995
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,200
No. I didn't leave.

996
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:31,500
So I was thinking we should invite
Rick and Debbie over for a cookout.

997
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,800
She's never gonna call. She thinks
I hate her. So...

998
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,600
just
let her off the hook

999
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
cookout?

1000
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,200
It'll be good to see the kids.

1001
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,200
We should get something for Emily
though. It's her birthday.

1002
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,500
She turned four last week

1003
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,800
Right. Okay

1004
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,300
Danny's is coming up

1005
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,500
I know.

1006
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,100
That's gonna be a tough one.

1007
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:15,700
Yes.

1008
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,700
So the kid... Jason.

1009
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,700
Did you tell
him we didn't blame him?

1010
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
- We don’t blame him.
- I know, but...

1011
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:32,900
let him know that?

1012
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:34,600
I guess so

1013
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:37,100
That's good

1014
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,700
- you Can talk with him if you want.
- I do not want to.

1015
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:41,600
Okay.

1016
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,500
It's so quiet.

1017
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,700
That's because I slipped Taz a
couple Ambien.

1018
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,900
You're funny

1019
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,600
You think I'm joking.

1020
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:06,700
So what are we gonna do?

1021
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,600
About what?

1022
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,300
I don't know.

1023
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,300
I don't know.

1024
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,100
Pick something

1025
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,200
Well...

1026
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,900
We could go to Village Toys

1027
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,000
pick up Candy Land for Emily

1028
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,700
probably something
she'd like

1029
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,700
candy, yes...

1030
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:47,100
Then what?

1031
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,400
Then we wrap it

1032
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,700
<i>And then we have the cookout...</i>

1033
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,700
<i>And they'll come over..</i>

1034
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,900
<i>And we'll have a couple
other people so...</i>

1035
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,300
<i>it's
not too awkward for anyone.</i>

1036
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:21,700
<i>Then...</i>

1037
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:23,500
<i>And to make them feel comfortable</i>

1038
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:29,700
<i>we'll ask a bunch of questions
about what the kids have been up to</i>

1039
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,100
<i>and we'll pretend that we're
really interested.</i>

1040
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,100

<i>And maybe that'll go on
for a little while.</i>

1044
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,100
