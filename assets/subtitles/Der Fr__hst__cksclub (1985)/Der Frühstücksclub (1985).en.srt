00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:35,496
Hey, hey, hey, hey

3
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:39,031
Ooh

4
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:43,200
Ooh-whoa

5
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:52,915
Won't you
come see about me

6
00:00:52,984 --> 00:00:57,887
I'll be alone
dancing, you know it, baby

7
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:01,823
Tell me
your troubles and doubts

8
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:06,626
Givin' me everything
inside and out and

9
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:10,463
Love's strange
So real in the dark

10
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:15,337
Think of the tender things
that we were working on

11
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:19,673
Slow change
may pull us apart

12
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:24,341
When the light gets
into your heart, baby

13
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:26,906
Don't you

14
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:30,420
Forget about me

15
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:33,287
Don't, don't
don't, don't

16
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:35,689
Don't you

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,252
Forget about me

18
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:45,832
Will you stand above me

19
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:50,307
Look my way
but never love me

20
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:55,004
Rain keeps fallin'
Rain keeps fallin'

21
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,414
Down, down, down

Saturday, March 24, 1984.

00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:17,091
Shermer High School,
Shermer, Illinois, 60062.

24
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:25,539
"Dear Mr. Vernon...

25
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,909
"We accept the fact that
we had to sacrifice a whole
Saturday in detention...

26
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,711
"for whatever it was
we did wrong.

27
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:33,579
"What we did was wrong...

28
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:39,819
"but we think you're crazy to make us
write an essay telling you who we are.

29
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,883
"What do you care?

30
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,521
"You see us
as you want to see us...

31
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:49,362
"in the simplest terms, with the most
convenient definitions.

32
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,901
"You see us as a brain...

33
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:56,599
"an athlete, a basket case...

34
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:59,007
"a princess...

35
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:01,408
"and a criminal.

36
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,913
"Correct?

37
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:10,543
"That's the way we saw each other
at 7:00 this morning.

38
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:12,556
We were brainwashed. '

39
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:26,700
I can't believe
you can't get me out of this.

40
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:31,765
It's so absurd I have to
be here on a Saturday.

41
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:34,606
It's not like
I'm a defective or anything.

42
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,170
I'll make it up to you.

43
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:39,581
Honey, ditching class to go shopping
doesn't make you a defective.

44
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,949
Have a good day.

45
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:51,252
Is this the first time
or last time we do this?
Last.

46
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,060
Well, get in there and use the time
to your advantage.

47
00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:56,930
Mom, we're not supposed to study.
We have to sit there and do nothing.

48
00:03:57,002 --> 00:04:00,129
Well, mister, you figure out
a way to study.
Yeah.

49
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:04,502
Well, go.

50
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:12,643
Hey, I screwed around.

51
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:15,585
Guys screw around.
There's nothing wrong with that...

52
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:19,920
except you
got caught, sport.
Yeah, Mom already reamed me.

53
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:22,653
You want to miss a match?
You want to blow your ride?

54
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:27,221
Now, no school is gonna give
a scholarship to a discipline case.

55
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:59,384
Well, well.
Here we are.

56
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:02,887
I wanna congratulate you
for being on time.

57
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:06,761
Excuse me, sir?
I think there's been a mistake.

58
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:11,201
I know it's detention but, um,
I don't think I belong in here.

59
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:17,473
It is now 7:06.

60
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:22,309
You have exactly eight hours
and fifty-four minutes to
think about why you're here.

61
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,214
Ponder the error
of your ways.

62
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:28,752
You may not talk.

63
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:35,382
You will not move
from these seats.

64
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:40,692
And you...
will not sleep.

65
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,362
All right, people,
we're going to try something
a little different today.

66
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:54,810
We are going to write an essay...
of no less than a thousand words...

67
00:06:56,882 --> 00:07:00,045
describing to me
who you think you are.
Is this a test?

68
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:04,747
And when I say essay,
I mean essay.

69
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:10,158
I do not mean a single word
repeated a thousand times.

70
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:14,288
- Is that clear, Mr. Bender?
- Crystal.

71
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:18,028
Good. Maybe you'll learn
something about yourself.

72
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:21,800
Maybe you'll even decide
whether or not
you care to return.

73
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:25,309
Uh, I can answer
that right now, sir.

74
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:28,641
- That'd be no for me, 'cause...
- Sit down, Johnson.

75
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:31,045
Thank you, sir.

76
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:37,377
My office is right across
that hall. Any monkey business
is ill-advised.

77
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:40,185
Any questions?

78
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:43,786
Yeah. I got a question.

79
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:46,887
Does Barry Manilow know
that you raid his wardrobe?

80
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:50,161
I'll give you the answer to that question,
Mr. Bender, next Saturday.

81
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:55,933
Don't mess with the bull,
young man, you'll get the horns.

82
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:00,673
That man is
a brownie hound.

83
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,706
You keep eating your hand,
you're not going to be hungry for lunch.

84
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:40,607
I've seen you before,
you know.

85
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:52,922
Who I think I am.

86
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:55,625
Who are you?

87
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,191
Who are you?

88
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:02,038
I am a walrus.

89
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:36,005
It's the shits, huh?

90
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,965
I can't believe
this is really happening to me.

91
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,975
Oh, shit!

92
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:15,375
What are we supposed to
do if we have to piss?
Please.

93
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:18,644
If you got to go,
you got to go.

94
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:20,707
Oh, my God.

95
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,878
You're not
urinating in here, man.
Don't talk. Don't talk.

96
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:26,650
- It makes it crawl back up.
- You whip it out, you're dead
before the first drop hits.

97
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:32,553
You're pretty sexy
when you get angry.

98
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,659
Hey, homeboy, why don't you
go close that door.

99
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:40,398
We'll get the prom queen
impregnated.

100
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,630
Hey. Hey!

101
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:46,370
- What?
- If I lose my temper,
you're totaled, man.

102
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:50,880
- Totally?
- Totally.

103
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:54,350
Why don't you shut up?
Nobody here's interested.

104
00:10:56,053 --> 00:10:58,544
Really. Buttface.

105
00:10:58,623 --> 00:11:03,322
Hey, sporto, what'd you do
to get in here?
Forget to wash your jock?

106
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:06,227
Uh, excuse me, fellas,
I think we should
just write our papers.

107
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:09,697
Just because you live in here
doesn't give you the right
to be a pain in the ass.

108
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:12,861
So knock it off!
It's a free country.

109
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:16,838
He's just doing it
to get a rise out of you.
Just ignore him.

110
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:20,344
Sweets.

111
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:23,073
You couldn't ignore me
if you tried.

112
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:27,349
So...

113
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:29,943
so...

114
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,715
are you guys like
boyfriend-girlfriend?

115
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,192
Steady dates?

116
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,561
Lovers?

117
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,966
Come on, sporto.
Level with me.

118
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:47,596
Do you slip her
the hot-beef injection?

119
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:50,139
Go to hell!
Enough!

120
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,698
Hey! What's going on
in there?

121
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:56,046
Spoiled little pricks.

122
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:03,720
Scumbag.

123
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:08,589
What do you say
we close that door?

124
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:11,220
Can't have any kind of party with Vernon
checking us every few seconds.

125
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:13,287
You know the door's
supposed to stay open.

126
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:15,229
So what?
So why don't you
just shut up.

127
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:18,133
- There's four other
people in here, you know?
- God, you can count.

128
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:20,261
I knew you had to be smart
to be a wrestler.

129
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:22,932
Who the hell are you
to judge anybody anyway?
Really.

130
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:25,600
You know, Bender,
you don't even count.

131
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:28,668
If you disappear forever,
it wouldn't make any difference.

132
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:31,739
You may as well not even
exist at this school.

133
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:36,782
Well, I'll run right out
and join the wrestling team.

134
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:41,485
Maybe the prep club too.
Student council.

135
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:43,618
Nah.
They wouldn't take you.

136
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:46,926
- I'm hurt.
- You know why guys like you
knock everything?

137
00:12:46,998 --> 00:12:49,432
This should be stunning.
Because you're afraid.

138
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,664
Oh, God. You richies are
so smart. That's exactly why
I'm not heavy in activities.

139
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:57,003
- You're a big coward.
- I'm in a Math Club.

140
00:12:57,075 --> 00:13:01,408
You're afraid that they won't
take you, you don't belong,
so you dump all over it.

141
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:06,780
Well, it wouldn't have anything
to do with you activities
people being assholes, would it?

142
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,513
Well, you wouldn't know.
You don't even know any of us.

143
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:11,782
Well, I don't know
any lepers either...

144
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:14,187
but I'm not going to run
and join one of their fucking clubs.

145
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:17,057
Hey, let's watch
the mouth, huh?
I'm in Physics Club too.

146
00:13:17,128 --> 00:13:20,393
Excuse me a sec.
What are you babbling about?

147
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:23,628
What I said was that
I'm in the Math Club...

148
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:26,864
uh, the Latin Club
and the Physics Club... Physics Club.

149
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,672
Hey. Cherry.

150
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:35,845
Do you belong to
the Physics Club?

151
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:39,246
That's an academic club.
So?

152
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,846
Academic clubs aren't the same
as other kinds of clubs.

153
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:47,379
Ah, but to dorks
like him, they are.

154
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:51,657
What do you guys
do in your club?

155
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:56,393
In physics, well, we talk about physics.
Properties of physics.

156
00:13:56,466 --> 00:14:01,666
So it's sort of social.
Demented and sad, but social, right?

157
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:04,730
I guess
you could consider it
a social situation.

158
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:09,438
Um, I mean, there are
other children in my club. And, uh...

159
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:13,711
at the end of the year, we have, um,
we have a big banquet at the Hilton.

160
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:16,048
You load up. You party.

161
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,750
No. We get dressed up,
but we don't get high.

162
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:25,125
- Only burners like you get high.
- And I didn't have any shoes,
so I had to borrow my dad's.

163
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:27,857
It's weird 'cause my mom doesn't like me
to wear other people's shoes.

164
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:32,062
My counsel Kent...
My cousin Kendall from Indiana,
he got high once.

165
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:34,969
And, you know, he started eating,
like, really weird foods.

166
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:39,032
Then he felt like he didn't
belong anywhere, kind of
like Twilight Zone, kinda?

167
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,943
- Sounds like you.
- You guys keep up your talking
and Vernon's gonna come in.

168
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:46,540
I got a meet this Saturday,
and I'm not gonna miss it
on account of you boneheads.

169
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,711
Oh, and wouldn't that
be a bite?

170
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:50,720
Missing a whole
wrestling meet?

171
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:52,880
You wouldn't know
anything about it, faggot.

172
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:54,947
You never competed
in your whole life.

173
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:57,687
Oh, I know. I feel
all empty inside because of it.

174
00:14:57,761 --> 00:15:02,289
I have such a deep admiration
for guys who roll around
on the floor with other guys.

175
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:06,769
You'd never miss it.
You don't have any goals.
Oh, but I do.

176
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:09,328
I want to be just like you.

177
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:12,466
I figure all I need's
a lobotomy and some tights.

178
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:16,403
You wear tights?

179
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,813
No, I don't wear tights.

180
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:22,682
- I wear the required uniform.
- Tights.

181
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:25,221
Shut up.

182
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:41,034
Woo!

183
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,865
There's not supposed to
be any monkey business.

184
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,606
Young man, have you
finished your paper?

185
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:56,043
Come on, Bender.
Don't screw around.

186
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,350
What are you
going to do?
Drop dead, I hope.

187
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:10,062
All right!

188
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:14,298
Bender, that's-that's
school property there,
and it doesn't belong to us.

189
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:17,739
- It's something not to be
toyed with.
- That's very funny. Fix it.

190
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:19,970
You should really fix that.
Am I a genius?

191
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:22,534
No, you're an asshole.
Fix the door, Bender.
What a funny guy.

192
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:25,548
Everyone, just shh.
I've been here before.
I know what I'm doing.

193
00:16:25,615 --> 00:16:27,913
- No. Fix the door!
- Shut up!

194
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:30,510
Goddamn it!

195
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:36,115
Why is that door closed?

196
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:43,088
Why is that door closed?
How are we supposed to know?
We're not supposed to move.

197
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:50,338
- Why?
- We're just sitting here
like we're supposed to.

198
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:57,269
Who closed that door?

199
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,446
- I think a screw fell out of it.
- It just closed, sir.

200
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:05,778
Who?

201
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:09,223
She doesn't talk, sir.

202
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:12,228
Give me that screw.
I don't have it.

203
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:14,594
You want me to yank you
out of that seat?

204
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:18,692
I don't have it.
Screws fall out all the time.
The world's an imperfect place.

205
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:20,634
Give it to me, Bender.

206
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:23,037
Excuse me, sir.
Why would anybody
want to steal a screw?

207
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:26,405
Watch it, young lady.

208
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:37,444
The door's
way too heavy, sir.

209
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:46,923
Damn it!

210
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:55,132
Andrew Clark,
get up here.

211
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:59,142
Come on. Front and center.
Let's go.

212
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,701
- Hey, how come Andrew
gets to get up?
- That's right.

213
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:05,306
If he gets up, we'll all get up.
It'll be anarchy!

214
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:10,276
Watch-Watch
the magazines.
It's out of my hands.

215
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:19,619
That's very clever, sir,
but what if there's a fire?

216
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:24,156
I think violating fire codes
and endangering the lives of children...

217
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:26,395
would be unwise at this juncture
in your career, sir.

218
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:29,962
All right. What are you doing
with this? Get this out of here,
for God's sake.

219
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,509
What's the matter with you?
Come on.

220
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:35,511
You know, the school
comes equipped with fire exits
at either end of the library.

221
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:38,980
- Show Dick some respect.
- Let's go.

222
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:41,518
Go. Get back in your seat.

223
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:47,682
I expected a little more
from a varsity letterman.

224
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,953
You're not fooling
anybody, Bender.

225
00:18:51,028 --> 00:18:54,794
The next screw that
falls out is gonna be you.

226
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:58,961
- Eat my shorts.
- What was that?

227
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:04,539
Eat... my... shorts.

228
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:07,577
You just bought yourself
another Saturday, mister.

229
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:10,170
- Oh, I'm crushed.
- You just bought
one more right there.

230
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:14,183
Well, I'm free the Saturday
after that. Beyond that,
I'll have to check my calendar.

231
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:17,016
Good! Because it's gonna be filled.
We'll keep going.

232
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:20,818
You want another one?
Say the word. Just say the word.

233
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:24,726
Instead of going to prison,
you'll come here.

234
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:26,887
- Are you through?
- No.

235
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:30,661
I'm doing society a favor.
That's another right now.
So?

236
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:33,567
I've got you for the rest
of your life if you don't
watch your step.

237
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:35,628
You want another one?
Yes.

238
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:38,868
You got it! You got
another one right there.
That's another one, pal.

239
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:41,001
Cut it out!

240
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:43,307
Stop.
You through?

241
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:46,373
Not even close, bud.

242
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,544
- You got one more right there.
- You really think I give a shit?

243
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:51,587
Another.

244
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,849
- You through?
- How many is that?

245
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:58,588
That's seven, including
the one when you asked
Mr. Vernon here...

246
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:00,857
whether Barry Manilow knew
he raided his closet.

247
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:03,423
- Now it's eight. Stay out of it.
- Excuse me, sir. It's seven.

248
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,026
Shut up, peewee.

249
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:13,573
You're mine, Bender.
For two months, I got ya.

250
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:16,112
I got ya.

251
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,080
What can I say?
I'm thrilled.

252
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,086
Oh, I sure that's exactly
what you want these people
to believe. You know something?

253
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:26,351
You ought to spend
a little more time trying to
do something with yourself...

254
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:29,290
and a little less time
trying to impress people.

255
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,090
You might be better off.
All right. That's it!

256
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:35,394
I'm gonna be
right outside those doors.

257
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:40,061
The next time
I have to come in here,
I'm cracking skulls.

258
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:54,409
Fuck you!

259
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,352
Fuck.

260
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:48,587
Wake up!

261
00:22:52,103 --> 00:22:54,195
Who has to go
to the lavatory?

262
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:16,855
- That's real intelligent.
- You're right.

263
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:18,917
It's wrong
to destroy literature.

264
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:21,828
It's such fun to read.

265
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:24,230
And...

266
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,763
"Molay" really pumps my nads.

267
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,569
Moliere.

268
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:35,936
I love his work.

269
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:49,090
Big deal. Nothing to do
when you're locked in a vacancy.

270
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,127
Speak for yourself.

271
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:56,861
Do you think I'd speak for you?
I don't even know your language.

272
00:23:56,933 --> 00:24:00,664
Hey, you grounded tonight?

273
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:05,198
I don't know. My mom said I was.
My dad told me just to blow her off.

274
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:13,305
There's a big party at Stubby's.
His parents are in Europe.

275
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:16,842
It should be pretty wild.
Are you going to go?
Yeah?

276
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:20,682
- I doubt it.
- How come?

277
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:24,750
'Cause if I do what my mother
tells me not to do, it's because
my father says it's okay.

278
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:28,162
It's like this whole, big monster deal.
It's endless. It's a total drag.

279
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:30,165
It's like,
any minute, divorce.

280
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:33,692
- Who do you like better?
- What?

281
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,898
- You like your old man
better than your mom?
- They're both screwed.

282
00:24:36,973 --> 00:24:39,464
No, I mean, if you had
to choose between 'em.

283
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,342
I don't know. Probably go live
with my brother.

284
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,720
I mean, I don't think either one
of them gives a shit about me.

285
00:24:50,788 --> 00:24:53,915
- It's like they use me
to get back at each other.
- Ha!

286
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:06,496
- Shut up!
- You're just feeling
sorry for yourself.

287
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:08,935
Yeah, if I didn't,
nobody else would.

288
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:11,566
Oh, you're breaking
my heart. What?
Sporto?

289
00:25:14,644 --> 00:25:16,578
You get along
with your parents?

290
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:19,240
Well, If I say yes,
I'm an idiot, right?

291
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:23,711
You're an idiot anyway.

292
00:25:23,787 --> 00:25:27,450
But if you say you get along with
your parents, well, you're a liar too.

293
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:39,625
You know something, man?
If we weren't in school, I'd waste you.

294
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:42,536
Can you hear this?

295
00:25:42,605 --> 00:25:46,269
You want me
to turn it up?

296
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:49,506
Hey, fellas, I mean...

297
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:52,878
I don't like my parents, either.
I mean, I don't...

298
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:57,717
I don't get along
with them when their idea
of parental compassion...

299
00:25:57,788 --> 00:26:01,451
is just, you know,
wacko, you know.

300
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:03,924
Dork.
Yeah?

301
00:26:03,993 --> 00:26:06,986
You are a parent's
wet dream, okay?

302
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:13,496
That's the problem.
Look, I can see you
getting all bunged up...

303
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,903
for them making you wear
these kind of clothes...

304
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:19,635
but, face it, you're
a neo-maxi-zoon-dweebie.

305
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,542
What would you be doing if
you weren't out making
yourself a better citizen?

306
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:25,776
Why do you have to
insult everybody?

307
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:28,339
I'm being honest,
asshole.

308
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:31,582
I would expect you
to know the difference.

309
00:26:31,654 --> 00:26:34,488
Well, he's got a name.
Yeah.
Yeah?

310
00:26:34,557 --> 00:26:36,958
What's your name?
Brian.

311
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:40,258
See?
My condolences.

312
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:45,257
What's your name?

313
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:50,334
What's yours?

314
00:26:50,406 --> 00:26:52,534
- Claire.
- Claire?

315
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,634
Claire.
It's a family name.

316
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:57,509
- Oh. It's a fat girl's name.
- Oh, thank you.

317
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,605
You're welcome.
I'm not fat.

318
00:26:59,682 --> 00:27:01,980
Not at present, but I can see you
really pushing maximum density.

319
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:06,546
You see, I'm not sure if you
know this, but there are
two kinds of fat people...

320
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:10,115
there's fat people
that were born to be fat...

321
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:13,856
and there's fat people
that were once thin,
but they became fat.

322
00:27:13,931 --> 00:27:17,730
So when you look at them,
you can sort of see
that thin person inside.

323
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,734
You see,
you're gonna get married.

324
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:22,863
You're gonna squeeze out
a few puppies, and then...

325
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:30,971
Oh. Obscene finger gestures
from such a pristine girl.

326
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:34,039
I'm not that pristine.

327
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:39,188
Are you a virgin?

328
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:45,320
I'll bet you
a million dollars that you are.

329
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,664
Let's end the suspense.

330
00:27:49,732 --> 00:27:53,692
Is it going to
be a white wedding?

331
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,864
Why don't you just shut up.

332
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:57,906
Have you ever kissed
a boy on the mouth?

333
00:28:00,711 --> 00:28:03,373
Have you ever
been felt up...

334
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:07,076
over the bra,
under the blouse...

335
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:09,016
your shoes off...

336
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:11,680
hoping to God your
parents don't walk in?

337
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:16,182
Do you want me to puke?

338
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:20,394
Over the panties...

339
00:28:21,765 --> 00:28:23,699
no bra...

340
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:30,596
blouse unbuttoned,
Calvin's in a ball on the front seat...

341
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:33,107
past 11:00 on a school night?

342
00:28:34,377 --> 00:28:37,039
Leave her alone.

343
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,488
I said leave her alone.

344
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:54,319
- You gonna make me?
- Yeah.

345
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:05,602
You and how many
of your friends?

346
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:07,836
Just me.

347
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:11,074
Just you and me.
Two hits.

348
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:14,310
Me hitting you.
You hitting the floor.
Anytime you're ready, pal.

349
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,324
I don't want
to get into this, man.

350
00:29:27,396 --> 00:29:29,557
Why not?

351
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,964
Because I'd kill you.

352
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:38,401
It's real simple.
I'd kill you...

353
00:29:38,474 --> 00:29:41,467
and your fucking parents
would sue me,
and it'd be a big mess.

354
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:45,709
I don't care enough
about you to bother.

355
00:29:45,782 --> 00:29:48,615
Chickenshit.

356
00:29:58,694 --> 00:30:01,288
Let's end this
right now.

357
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:05,631
You don't talk to her.
You don't look at her.

358
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:07,965
And you don't even
think about her!
You understand me?

359
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:11,339
I'm trying to help her.

360
00:30:33,329 --> 00:30:35,263
Brian, how you doing?

361
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:41,194
Your dad work here?

362
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:46,834
Uh, Carl?
What?

363
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,073
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

364
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:53,673
- How does one become a janitor?
- You want to be a janitor?

365
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,742
No. I just want to know
how one becomes a janitor,
because Andrew here...

366
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,586
is very interested
in pursuing a career
in the custodial arts.

367
00:31:01,657 --> 00:31:04,718
Oh, really?

368
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,758
You guys think
I'm some untouchable peasant,
serf, peon, you know?

369
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:14,236
Maybe so.
But following a broom around
after shitheads like you...

370
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:16,534
for the last eight years,
I've learned a couple of things.

371
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:21,544
I look through your letters.
I look through your lockers.

372
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:24,775
I listen to your conversations.
You don't know that, but I do.

373
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:30,150
I am the eyes and ears of
this institution, my friends.

374
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:35,121
By the way, that clock's
20 minutes fast.

375
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:39,288
Shit.

376
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:27,204
All right, girls.
That's 30 minutes for lunch.

377
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:29,939
Here?
Here.

378
00:32:30,012 --> 00:32:33,311
I think the cafeteria would be
a more suitable place for
us to eat lunch in.

379
00:32:33,383 --> 00:32:37,786
I don't care what
you think, Andrew.
Uh, Dick?

380
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:41,688
Excuse me, Rich. Will milk
be made available to us?

381
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:46,161
- We're extremely thirsty. Sir.
- I have a really low
tolerance for dehydration.

382
00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:48,992
I've seen her dehydrated, sir.
It's pretty gross.

383
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:53,001
Relax. I'll get it.
Ah-ah-ah.

384
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:55,867
Grab some wood there, bub.

385
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:59,500
What do you think,
I was born yesterday?

386
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:03,307
You think I'm going to
have you roaming these halls?

387
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,576
You.

388
00:33:10,787 --> 00:33:14,518
And you. Hey!

389
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,082
What's her name?
Wake her up.

390
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,221
Hey, come on.
On your feet, missy,
Let's go! This is no rest home.

391
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,364
There's a soft drink machine
in the teachers' lounge.
Let's go.

392
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:35,174
So...
what's your poison?

393
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:40,012
What do you drink?

394
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:44,145
Okay. Forget I asked.

395
00:33:46,088 --> 00:33:48,250
Vodka.

396
00:33:49,526 --> 00:33:53,052
Vodka?
When do you drink vodka?

397
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,461
Whenever.

398
00:33:56,465 --> 00:33:59,298
A lot?
Tons.

399
00:33:59,368 --> 00:34:02,701
Is that why
you're here today?

400
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:05,263
Why are you here?
Why are you here?

401
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:11,539
Um...

402
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:16,708
I'm here today
because, uh...

403
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:20,916
because my coach
and my father don't want me
to blow my ride.

404
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,983
I get treated differently because,
uh, coach thinks I'm a winner.

405
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:27,121
So does my old man.

406
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:29,757
I'm not a winner because
I want to be one.

407
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:33,826
I'm a winner because
I got strength and speed,
kind of like a racehorse.

408
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:39,605
That's about how involved
I am in what's happening to me.
Yeah?

409
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:43,635
That's very interesting.

410
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:48,775
Now why don't you tell me why
you're really in here.

411
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:52,184
Forget it.

412
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:02,621
Claire? Want to see a picture
of a guy with elephantiasis
of the nuts?

413
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:05,360
It's pretty tasty.
No, thank you.

414
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:09,166
How do you think
he rides a bike?

415
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:14,443
Claire?
Would you consider
dating a guy like this?

416
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,003
- Can't you just leave me alone?
- I mean, if he had
a great personality...

417
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:20,811
was a good dancer
and had a cool car?

418
00:35:20,884 --> 00:35:23,876
You'd probably have to
ride in the backseat because
his nuts would ride shotgun.

419
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:28,614
You know what I wish
I was doing?

420
00:35:28,692 --> 00:35:31,217
Watch what you say.
Brian here is a cherry.

421
00:35:31,293 --> 00:35:34,023
- A cherry?
- I wish I was in a plane...

422
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:37,396
- to France.
- I'm not a cherry.

423
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:41,130
- When have you ever gotten laid?
- I've laid lots of times.

424
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:45,003
- Name one.
- She lives in Canada.

425
00:35:45,074 --> 00:35:48,567
I met her at Niagara Falls.
You wouldn't know her.

426
00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:51,306
Ever laid anyone around here?

427
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,715
Oh.
You and Claire did it?

428
00:35:55,784 --> 00:35:58,947
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

429
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:01,182
Let's just drop it, okay?
We'll talk about it later.

430
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:03,726
- What are you talking about?
- Brian's trying to tell me...

431
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:07,057
that in addition to the number of girls
in the Niagara Falls area...

432
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,032
that presently you and he
are riding the hobby horse.

433
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:13,592
- Little pig.
- No, I'm not.

434
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,900
John said I was a cherry,
and I said I wasn't.
That's all that was said.

435
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:19,737
Then what were you
motioning to Claire for?

436
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:23,768
- I don't appreciate this
very much, Brian.
- He is lying.

437
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:27,077
You weren't motioning
to Claire?

438
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,880
You know he's lying, right?
Were you or were you not
motioning to Claire?

439
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:34,445
Yeah, but it was only...

440
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:37,425
It was only because
I didn't want her
to know I was a virgin.

441
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:40,856
Excuse me for
being a virgin. I'm sorry.

442
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:43,865
Why didn't you want me
to know you were a virgin?

443
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:47,130
Because it's personal business.
It's my personal, private
business.

444
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:49,467
Well, Brian, it doesn't sound
like you're doing any business.

445
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:52,235
I think it's okay
for a guy to be a virgin.

446
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:55,940
You do?

447
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:08,349
What's in there?

448
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:12,121
Guess.
Where's your lunch?

449
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:15,186
You're wearing it.
You're nauseating.

450
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:32,237
What's that?

451
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:35,943
- Sushi.
- Sushi?

452
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:40,318
Rice, raw fish
and seaweed.

453
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:46,420
You won't accept
a guy's tongue in your mouth,
and you're gonna eat that?

454
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:49,090
Can I eat?

455
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:51,599
I don't know.
Give it a try.

456
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:30,737
What's your problem?

457
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:31,690
What are we having?

458
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:34,760
Uh, it's your standard,
regular lunch, I guess.

459
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,601
Milk?
Soup.

460
00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:46,610
Uh, that's apple juice.
I can read.

461
00:39:47,751 --> 00:39:51,208
PB&J with the crusts cut off.

462
00:39:51,286 --> 00:39:54,619
Well, Brian, this is
a very nutritious lunch.

463
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:58,217
All the food groups
are represented.

464
00:39:58,293 --> 00:40:01,286
Did your mom
marry Mr. Rogers?

465
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:03,456
No, Mr. Johnson.
Hah.

466
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:10,094
Here's my impression of
the life at big Bri's house.

467
00:40:14,577 --> 00:40:18,740
- Son?
- Yeah, Dad?

468
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:22,079
How's your day, pal?
Great, Dad.

469
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:24,847
How's yours?
Super.

470
00:40:26,322 --> 00:40:31,452
Say, son, how'd you like
to go fishing this weekend?

471
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:36,465
Great, Dad.
But I've got homework to do.

472
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:39,831
That's all right, son.
You can do it on the boat.

473
00:40:39,902 --> 00:40:42,735
Gee!

474
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:50,972
Dear, isn't our son swell?
Yes, dear.

475
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:54,016
Isn't life swell?

476
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,016
Oh.

477
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:58,018
Oh.

478
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:09,025
All right.
What about your family?

479
00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:11,931
Who, mine?
It's real easy.
Yeah.

480
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:25,744
Stupid, worthless,
no-good...

481
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:29,148
goddamn freeloading
son of a bitch.

482
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:32,882
Retarded, big mouth,
know-it-all, asshole, jerk.

483
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:39,621
You forgot ugly,
lazy and disrespectful.

484
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:43,358
Shut up, bitch!
Go fix me a turkey potpie.

485
00:41:43,432 --> 00:41:47,869
- What about you, Dad?
- Fuck you.

486
00:41:47,936 --> 00:41:50,804
No, Dad.
What about you?
Fuck you!

487
00:41:50,873 --> 00:41:54,206
No, Dad. What about you?
Fuck you!

488
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:56,210
Bam!

489
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:02,213
- Is that for real?
- You want to come over sometime?

490
00:42:02,284 --> 00:42:04,684
That's bullshit.
It's all part of your image.

491
00:42:04,753 --> 00:42:07,278
- I don't believe a word of it.
- You don't believe me?

492
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:09,291
No.
No?

493
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:11,485
Did I stutter?

494
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:22,268
Do you
believe this? Huh?

495
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:27,875
It's about
the size of a cigar.
Do I stutter?

496
00:42:27,943 --> 00:42:32,244
See, this is what you get
in my house when you spill
paint in the garage.

497
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:39,485
I don't think that
I need to sit with you
fucking dildos anymore.

498
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:50,896
Fuck!

499
00:43:11,054 --> 00:43:13,887
- You shouldn't have said that.
- How did I know?

500
00:43:15,525 --> 00:43:17,458
I mean he lies about
everything anyway.

501
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:38,675
Oh, shit.

502
00:43:38,748 --> 00:43:43,583
Coffee. Looks like it's
been scraped off the bottom
of the Mississippi River.

503
00:43:45,588 --> 00:43:47,579
Everything's polluted.
Everything's polluted.

504
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:50,648
The coffee's polluted.
The kids are polluted.

505
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:06,498
How do you know
where Vernon went?
I don't.

506
00:44:06,576 --> 00:44:10,068
Then how do you know
when he'll be back?
I don't.

507
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:14,643
Being bad feels
pretty good. Huh?

508
00:44:16,952 --> 00:44:20,445
What's the point
of going to Bender's locker?
Beats me.

509
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:25,186
This is so stupid.
Why are we risking
getting caught?

510
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,751
I don't know.

511
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:30,923
So then what are we doing?
You ask me
one more question...

512
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,264
and I'm beating
the shit out of you.
Sorry.

513
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:43,275
You're such a slob.
My maid's
on vacation.

514
00:44:57,326 --> 00:45:01,489
It's drugs.

515
00:45:01,563 --> 00:45:03,532
Screw that, Bender.
Put it back.

516
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,260
Drugs.
The boy has marijuana.

517
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:11,603
That was marijuana.
Shut up, dick.

518
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:15,199
Do you approve
of this?

519
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:29,090
We'll cross through the lab,
and then we'll double back.

520
00:45:29,157 --> 00:45:32,490
You better be right.
 If Vernon cuts us off, it's your fault, asshole.

521
00:45:32,561 --> 00:45:35,224
What did he say?
Where are we going?

522
00:45:56,052 --> 00:46:00,079
Hot on the run from
the grip of the power game

523
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:07,856
The man who leads the way
The man who leads the way

524
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:12,594
Shell in its box from his
home that they'll never tame

525
00:46:12,668 --> 00:46:18,766
The man who leads the way
The man who leads the way

526
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,831
Wait. Wait.
Hold it. Hold it.

527
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:23,105
We have to go through
the cafeteria.
No, the activities hall.

528
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:25,739
Hey, man, you don't know
what you're talking about.
You don't know.

529
00:46:25,815 --> 00:46:29,376
We're through
listening to you.
We're going this way.

530
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:32,943
You go where you want,
mother hen. Come on!

531
00:46:35,757 --> 00:46:38,192
He is burning

532
00:46:39,528 --> 00:46:41,793
Burning in the twilight

533
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:46,563
He is turning
Turning to face us

534
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:51,130
He is burning

535
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:55,302
Fire in the twilight

536
00:46:55,378 --> 00:46:58,210
Shit!
Fuck you.
Great idea, jag-off.

537
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,271
Fuck you. Why didn't you
listen to John?

538
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:02,579
We're dead.

539
00:47:02,652 --> 00:47:07,315
No. Just me.
What do you mean?

540
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:11,382
Get back to the library.
Keep your unit out of it.

541
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,190
I wanna be
an airborne ranger

542
00:47:15,264 --> 00:47:19,030
I wanna be
an airborne ranger

543
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:22,592
- That son of a bitch.
- Before the day I die

544
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:25,300
There's five things
I want to ride

545
00:47:25,373 --> 00:47:27,898
Bicycle, tricycle
automobile

546
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:31,503
Virgin's mother
and a Ferris wheel

547
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:39,077
I wanna be
an airborne ranger

548
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:50,126
Three...

549
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:53,168
two, one!

550
00:47:55,237 --> 00:47:58,536
Bender! Bender!
What is this?

551
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:00,940
What are you doing here?
What is this?
Hi.

552
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:06,608
Out. That's it, Bender.
Out. It's over.

553
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:09,913
Don't you want
to hear my excuse?
Out.

554
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:12,318
I'm thinking of
trying out for a scholarship.

555
00:48:12,387 --> 00:48:15,880
Give me the ball, Bender.
Give me that ball.

556
00:48:33,742 --> 00:48:37,735
Get your stuff.
Let's go.

557
00:48:37,813 --> 00:48:41,646
Mr. Wise Guy here's
taken upon himself
to go to the gymnasium.

558
00:48:41,717 --> 00:48:45,949
I'm sorry to inform you,
you're going to be without his
services the rest of the day.

559
00:48:46,021 --> 00:48:49,115
B-O-O H-O-O.

560
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:52,592
Everything's a big joke, huh, Bender?
The false alarm you pulled Friday...

561
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:55,927
False alarms are really funny,
aren't they?

562
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:59,297
What if your home...
What if your family...

563
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:01,302
What if your dope was on fire?

564
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:05,635
Impossible, sir.
It's in Johnson's underwear.

565
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:07,766
You think he's funny?

566
00:49:07,842 --> 00:49:11,643
You think this is cute?
You think he's bitchin'? Is that it?

567
00:49:11,713 --> 00:49:16,481
Let me tell you something.
Look at him.

568
00:49:16,552 --> 00:49:18,610
He's a bum.

569
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:21,885
You want to see something funny?
You go visit John Bender in five years.

570
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:25,552
You'll see how
goddamn funny he is.

571
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:36,130
What's the matter, John?
You going to cry?

572
00:49:37,739 --> 00:49:42,574
Let's go.
Keep your
fuckin' hands off me!

573
00:49:42,644 --> 00:49:45,978
I expect better
manners from you, Dick.

574
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:49,840
For better hallway vision.

575
00:50:00,596 --> 00:50:02,893
That's the last time, Bender.

576
00:50:02,965 --> 00:50:06,264
That's the last time you ever
make me look bad in front of
those kids. You hear me?

577
00:50:06,335 --> 00:50:09,065
I make $31,000 a year,
and I've got a home.

578
00:50:09,137 --> 00:50:11,697
And I'm not about to
throw it away on some punk
like you.

579
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:13,867
But someday, man, someday...

580
00:50:13,943 --> 00:50:16,605
when you're outta here
and you've forgotten
all about this place...

581
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:20,775
and they've forgotten about you,
and you're wrapped up
in your own pathetic life...

582
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:23,375
I'm gonna be there.

583
00:50:23,452 --> 00:50:27,445
That's right. And I'm gonna kick
the livin' shit out of you.

584
00:50:27,523 --> 00:50:29,581
I'm gonna knock
your dick in the dirt.

585
00:50:32,894 --> 00:50:36,695
- You threatening me?
- What are you
going to do about it?

586
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:40,858
You think anybody's
gonna believe you?

587
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:45,936
You think anybody is gonna
take your word over mine?

588
00:50:47,576 --> 00:50:50,067
I'm a man of respect around here.
They love me around here.

589
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:54,445
I'm a swell guy.
You're a lying sack of shit,
and everybody knows it.

590
00:50:57,085 --> 00:51:00,577
You're a real tough guy.
Hey, hey. Come on.

591
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:03,989
Get on your feet, pal!
Let's find out how tough you are.

592
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:06,893
I wanna know, right now,
how tough you are. Come on.

593
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:10,625
I'll give you
the first punch. Let's go.
Come on. Right here.

594
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:13,668
Just take the first shot.
Please. I'm begging you.
Take a shot. Right here.

595
00:51:13,735 --> 00:51:16,568
Just take one shot.
That's all I need.

596
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:18,800
Just one swing.

597
00:51:27,882 --> 00:51:30,943
That's what I thought.

598
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:34,012
You're a gutless turd.

599
00:52:13,394 --> 00:52:16,228
A naked blond
walks into a bar...

600
00:52:16,297 --> 00:52:18,789
with a poodle
under one arm...

601
00:52:18,867 --> 00:52:22,860
and a two-foot salami
under the other.

602
00:52:22,938 --> 00:52:26,271
She lays the poodle
on the table.

603
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:30,005
Bartender says, "I suppose
you won't be needing a drink."

604
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,846
Naked lady says...
Oh, shit!

605
00:52:36,085 --> 00:52:38,177
Jesus Christ Almighty!

606
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:45,918
Forgot my pencil.

607
00:52:50,766 --> 00:52:52,699
Goddamn it!

608
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:57,664
What in God's name
is going on in here?

609
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:02,768
- What was that ruckus?
- What ruckus?

610
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:04,710
I was in my office,
and I heard a ruckus.

611
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,771
Could you describe
the ruckus, sir.

612
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:10,250
- Watch your tongue, young man.
Watch it.

613
00:53:12,353 --> 00:53:15,016
What is this?

614
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:19,789
- What is that? What-What...
What is that noise?
- What noise?

615
00:53:19,862 --> 00:53:21,887
Really sir, there wasn't
any noise.

616
00:53:21,963 --> 00:53:24,228
Ow!

617
00:53:32,675 --> 00:53:34,643
That noise?
Was that the noise
you were talking about?

618
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,940
No, it wasn't.
That was not the noise
I was talking about.

619
00:53:38,012 --> 00:53:43,280
Now, I may not have caught you
in the act this time,
but you can bet I will.

620
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:48,251
You make book
on that, missy.

621
00:53:48,324 --> 00:53:52,157
And you!
I will not be made a fool of.

622
00:54:08,643 --> 00:54:12,978
It was an accident.
You're an asshole.

623
00:54:13,047 --> 00:54:15,208
Sue me.

624
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,081
So, Ahab, can I have
all my doobage?

625
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:35,827
Yo, wastoid. You're not gonna
blaze up in here.

626
00:55:23,085 --> 00:55:25,985
Shit!

627
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:25,878
Chicks cannot
hold their smoke.
That's what it is.

628
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:33,518
Do you know
how popular I am?

629
00:56:33,588 --> 00:56:38,458
I am so popular.
Everybody loves me so much
at this school.

630
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:41,496
Poor baby.

631
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:51,630
Five.

632
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,318
Whoo!

633
00:57:34,882 --> 00:57:38,045
Whoo!

634
00:57:42,557 --> 00:57:44,355
Ow!

635
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:06,780
Mr... Oh, Mr. Tierney.

636
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:11,445
A history
of slight mental illness.

637
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,114
No wonder he's so fucked up.
Afternoon, Dick.

638
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:18,920
Good.
Hey, Carl. How you doing?
Good. What's up?

639
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:22,724
Not much. What's happening?
What are you doing
in the basement files?

640
00:58:22,797 --> 00:58:25,391
Oh, nothing. Nothing here.
Just doing a little homework.

641
00:58:25,467 --> 00:58:27,697
Homework, huh?
Yeah.

642
00:58:29,804 --> 00:58:32,672
Confidential files, huh?

643
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,768
Look, Carl. This is
a highly sensitive area,
and I tell you something.

644
00:58:36,844 --> 00:58:39,005
Certain people would be
very, very embarrassed.

645
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:42,244
I would really appreciate it
if-if this would be something...

646
00:58:42,317 --> 00:58:45,286
that you and I could...
could keep between us.

647
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:49,315
What are you gonna
do for me, man?
What would you like?

648
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:52,018
Got 50 bucks?
What?

649
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:54,119
Fifty bucks.

650
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:59,599
No, no, no, man.
No, you got a middle name?

651
00:58:59,668 --> 00:59:01,659
Yeah, I guess.

652
00:59:01,737 --> 00:59:06,436
Your middle name
is Ralph, as in puke.

653
00:59:08,076 --> 00:59:12,034
Your birthday,
it's March 12.
You're 5'91/2'.

654
00:59:12,114 --> 00:59:14,411
You weigh 130 pounds.

655
00:59:14,483 --> 00:59:16,951
And your
social security number is...

656
00:59:17,018 --> 00:59:22,217
049-38-0913.

657
00:59:24,293 --> 00:59:26,487
Wow.
Are you a psychic?

658
00:59:26,561 --> 00:59:28,496
No.

659
00:59:29,898 --> 00:59:32,764
Would you mind telling me
how you know all this about me?

660
00:59:36,938 --> 00:59:39,065
I stole your wallet.
Give it to me.

661
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:41,632
No.
Give it!

662
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:44,110
This is great.
You're a thief too, huh?

663
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:46,773
I'm not a thief.
Multitalented.

664
00:59:46,847 --> 00:59:50,840
What's there to steal?
Two bucks and a beaver shot.
A what?

665
00:59:50,918 --> 00:59:53,547
He's got a nudie picture in there.
I saw it. It's perverted.

666
00:59:53,621 --> 00:59:56,590
All right.
Let's see it.

667
01:00:03,264 --> 01:00:06,701
- Are all these your girlfriends?
- Some of 'em.

668
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:08,702
What about the others?

669
01:00:08,769 --> 01:00:13,172
Well, some I consider my girlfriends,
and some I just consider.

670
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,175
Consider what?

671
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:17,335
Whether or not I wanna
hang out with them.

672
01:00:17,411 --> 01:00:19,880
You don't believe
in just one guy, one girl?

673
01:00:21,248 --> 01:00:24,012
- Do you?
- Yeah.

674
01:00:24,085 --> 01:00:27,021
- It's the way it should be.
- Well, not for me.

675
01:00:27,088 --> 01:00:29,454
Why not?

676
01:00:29,523 --> 01:00:31,514
How come you got
so much shit in your purse?

677
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:34,686
- How come you have
so many girlfriends?
- I asked you first.

678
01:00:36,164 --> 01:00:38,257
I don't know. I guess I never
threw anything away.

679
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:43,737
- Neither do I.
- Oh.

680
01:00:43,804 --> 01:00:47,969
This is the worst fake I.D.
I've ever seen.

681
01:00:48,043 --> 01:00:49,976
Do you realize
you made yourself 68?

682
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:52,672
I know. I know.
I goofed it.

683
01:00:52,748 --> 01:00:54,978
What do you need
a fake ID. For?

684
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:57,746
So I can vote.

685
01:00:57,818 --> 01:00:59,753
You wanna see
what's in my bag?

686
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,755
No.

687
01:01:17,172 --> 01:01:19,106
Holy shit!

688
01:01:19,173 --> 01:01:21,733
What is all that stuff?

689
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:24,677
Do you always carry
this much shit in your bag?

690
01:01:24,746 --> 01:01:26,679
Yeah.

691
01:01:26,748 --> 01:01:30,342
I always carry
this much shit in my bag.

692
01:01:31,485 --> 01:01:34,284
You never know when
you may have to jam.

693
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:38,519
Are you gonna be,
like, a shopping bag lady?

694
01:01:38,592 --> 01:01:41,425
You know, like,
sit in alley ways...

695
01:01:41,496 --> 01:01:44,329
and talk to buildings
and wear men's shoes
and that kind of thing?

696
01:01:44,398 --> 01:01:46,958
I'll do what
I have to do.

697
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:50,333
Why do you have to
do anything?

698
01:01:50,405 --> 01:01:55,432
My home life...
is unsatisfying.

699
01:01:57,012 --> 01:01:59,242
So you're saying you'd subject yourself
to the violent dangers...

700
01:01:59,313 --> 01:02:02,806
of these Chicago streets
because your home life is unsatisfying?

701
01:02:02,884 --> 01:02:04,818
I don't have to run away
and live in the street.

702
01:02:04,885 --> 01:02:06,820
I can run away
and go to the ocean.

703
01:02:06,887 --> 01:02:08,822
I can go to the country,
to the mountains.

704
01:02:08,889 --> 01:02:12,485
I could go to Israel,
Africa... Afghanistan.

705
01:02:21,635 --> 01:02:23,797
Andy, wanna get in
on this?

706
01:02:23,871 --> 01:02:27,034
Allison here says
she wants to run away...

707
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:30,976
because her home life
is unsatisfying.

708
01:02:32,514 --> 01:02:34,708
Well, everyone's home life
is unsatisfying.

709
01:02:36,384 --> 01:02:39,478
And if it wasn't,
people would live
with their parents forever.

710
01:02:39,554 --> 01:02:42,784
Yeah, yeah, I understand,
but I think hers goes beyond...

711
01:02:42,858 --> 01:02:47,556
what, you know,
guys like you and me
consider normal unsatisfying.

712
01:02:47,628 --> 01:02:51,360
Never mind. Forget it.
Everything's cool.

713
01:02:51,432 --> 01:02:54,094
- What's the deal?
- No.

714
01:02:54,168 --> 01:02:56,534
There's no deal, sporto.

715
01:02:56,605 --> 01:02:59,335
Forget it.
Leave me alone.
Wait a minute.

716
01:02:59,407 --> 01:03:02,432
You're carrying all that crap
around in your purse.

717
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:06,003
Either you really wanna
run away, or you want people
to think you wanna run away.

718
01:03:06,081 --> 01:03:08,811
Eat shit!

719
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:14,782
The girl is an island
unto herself, okay?

720
01:03:24,231 --> 01:03:27,065
Hi.

721
01:03:27,135 --> 01:03:29,126
You wanna talk?
No.

722
01:03:29,204 --> 01:03:32,969
Why not?
Go away.

723
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:36,938
Where do you
want me to go?
Go away!

724
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:50,583
- You have problems.
- Oh, I have problems.

725
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:53,628
You do everything
everybody tells you to do.
That is a problem.

726
01:03:53,695 --> 01:03:56,391
Okay, fine.
But I didn't dump my purse
out on the couch...

727
01:03:56,463 --> 01:04:01,992
and invite people
into my problems, did I?

728
01:04:06,675 --> 01:04:08,608
So what's wrong?

729
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:11,945
What is it?

730
01:04:14,114 --> 01:04:17,277
Is it bad?

731
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:20,847
Real bad?

732
01:04:20,922 --> 01:04:22,856
Parents?

733
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:40,197
Yeah.

734
01:04:49,717 --> 01:04:51,811
What did they do to you?

735
01:04:54,088 --> 01:04:56,818
They ignore me.

736
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:00,126
Yeah.

737
01:05:02,864 --> 01:05:04,855
Yeah.

738
01:05:07,702 --> 01:05:10,193
What did you wanna be
when you were young?

739
01:05:11,907 --> 01:05:15,034
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be John Lennon.

740
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,509
Carl, don't be a goof.

741
01:05:18,579 --> 01:05:21,208
I'm trying to make
a serious point here.

742
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:24,150
Carl, I've been teaching
for 22 years.

743
01:05:25,954 --> 01:05:29,514
And each year, these kids
get more and more arrogant.

744
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:32,355
Oh, bullshit, man.
Come on, Vern.

745
01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:36,090
- The kids haven't changed,
you have.

746
01:05:36,164 --> 01:05:40,362
You took a teaching position
'cause you thought
it'd be fun, right?

747
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:43,597
Thought you could have
summer vacations off.

748
01:05:43,672 --> 01:05:47,505
And then you found out
it was actually work.
That really bummed you out.

749
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:52,235
These kids turned on me.

750
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:58,416
They think
I'm a big fucking joke.
Come on.

751
01:05:58,485 --> 01:06:03,253
Listen, Vern. If you were 16,
what would you think of you?

752
01:06:03,324 --> 01:06:08,057
Hey, Carl, you think
I give one rat's ass
what these kids think of me?

753
01:06:08,128 --> 01:06:10,528
Yes, I do.

754
01:06:10,597 --> 01:06:15,001
You think about this.
When you get old, these kids...

755
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:18,061
when I get old... they're gonna be
running the country.

756
01:06:18,139 --> 01:06:20,300
Yeah.

757
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:23,775
Now this is the thought
that wakes me up
in the middle of the night.

758
01:06:25,179 --> 01:06:28,740
When I get older,
these kids are gonna
take care of me.

759
01:06:30,085 --> 01:06:32,451
I wouldn't count on it.

760
01:06:35,856 --> 01:06:39,257
What would I do
for a million bucks?

761
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:42,193
I guess I'd do
as little as I had to.

762
01:06:42,262 --> 01:06:44,731
That's boring.
Well, how am I
supposed to answer?

763
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:49,099
The idea is to, like, search your mind
for the absolute limit.

764
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:53,469
Like, um... would you
drive to school naked?

765
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:59,603
Um... would I have to
get out of the car?

766
01:06:59,681 --> 01:07:03,617
- Of course.
- In the spring or winter?

767
01:07:03,684 --> 01:07:05,619
Doesn't matter. Spring.

768
01:07:05,686 --> 01:07:08,177
In front of the school
or in back of the school?

769
01:07:08,255 --> 01:07:11,157
- Either one.
- Yes.

770
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:13,592
I'd do that.

771
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:17,027
I'll do anything sexual.
I don't need a million dollars
to do it either.

772
01:07:18,565 --> 01:07:21,501
- You're lying.
- I already have.

773
01:07:21,568 --> 01:07:24,969
I've done just about
everything there is, except
a few things that are illegal.

774
01:07:26,373 --> 01:07:30,833
- I'm a nymphomaniac.
- Lie.

775
01:07:30,911 --> 01:07:32,971
Are your parents
aware of this?

776
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:35,880
The only person I told
was my shrink.

777
01:07:35,949 --> 01:07:38,110
What did he do
when you told him?

778
01:07:38,186 --> 01:07:40,210
He nailed me.

779
01:07:44,192 --> 01:07:46,126
Very nice.

780
01:07:46,193 --> 01:07:48,286
I don't think that
from a legal standpoint...

781
01:07:48,362 --> 01:07:51,355
what he did can be construed as rape
since I paid him.

782
01:07:51,432 --> 01:07:55,528
- He's an adult.
- Yeah. He's married too.

783
01:07:55,603 --> 01:07:59,800
Oh! Do you have any idea
how completely gross that is?

784
01:07:59,873 --> 01:08:03,139
Well, the first
few times...
The first few times?

785
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:05,543
You mean, he did it
more than once?
Sure.

786
01:08:05,612 --> 01:08:09,070
Are you crazy?
Obviously she's crazy
if she's screwing her shrink.

787
01:08:11,552 --> 01:08:13,543
Have you ever done it?

788
01:08:15,757 --> 01:08:17,850
I don't even have a psychiatrist.

789
01:08:17,926 --> 01:08:20,326
Have you ever done it
with a normal person?

790
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:24,524
- Didn't we already cover this?
- You never answered the question.

791
01:08:24,599 --> 01:08:28,796
Look. I'm not going to discuss
my private life with total strangers.

792
01:08:28,869 --> 01:08:30,929
It's kind of a
double-edged sword, isn't it?

793
01:08:31,005 --> 01:08:35,338
A what?
If you say you haven't,
you're a prude.

794
01:08:35,409 --> 01:08:39,470
If you say you have,
you're a slut. It's a trap.

795
01:08:39,546 --> 01:08:41,480
You want to,
but you can't.

796
01:08:41,548 --> 01:08:45,382
And when you do, you wish
you didn't, right?
Wrong.

797
01:08:45,453 --> 01:08:47,944
Or are you a tease?

798
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:52,315
She's a tease.
I'm sure.
Why don't you forget it?

799
01:08:52,393 --> 01:08:55,555
You're a tease
and you know it.
All girls are teases.

800
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:58,622
- She's only a tease if what
she does gets you hot.
- I don't do anything!

801
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:03,363
- That's why you're a tease.
- Okay, let me ask you
a few questions.

802
01:09:03,438 --> 01:09:05,632
I already
told you everything.
No.

803
01:09:05,707 --> 01:09:08,971
Doesn't it bother you to sleep
around without being in love?
Don't you want respect?

804
01:09:09,042 --> 01:09:11,738
I don't screw
to get respect.

805
01:09:11,813 --> 01:09:13,747
That's the difference
between you and me.

806
01:09:13,814 --> 01:09:15,908
It's not the only difference
I hope.

807
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:18,578
Face it, you're a tease.
I'm not a tease.

808
01:09:18,653 --> 01:09:20,847
Sure you are.
Sex is your weapon.

809
01:09:20,921 --> 01:09:23,823
You said it yourself.
You use it to get respect.

810
01:09:23,891 --> 01:09:27,658
No, I never said that.
She twisted my words around.

811
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:30,823
- What do you use it for then?
- I don't use it, period!

812
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:34,426
Are you medically frigid
or is it psychological?

813
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:37,903
I didn't mean it that way.
You guys are putting words
into my mouth.

814
01:09:37,971 --> 01:09:40,770
- Just answer the question.
-  - Why don't you just answer the question?

815
01:09:40,841 --> 01:09:43,708
Be honest.
No big deal.
Yeah, answer it.

816
01:09:43,778 --> 01:09:46,576
- Just answer the question.
- Talk to us.
- Answer the question!

817
01:09:46,648 --> 01:09:49,275
Don't be a jerk!
It's easy.
It's only one question.

818
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,750
No, I never did it!

819
01:09:56,323 --> 01:09:59,622
I never did it either.

820
01:10:01,128 --> 01:10:04,895
I'm not a nymphomaniac.
I'm a compulsive liar.

821
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,524
You are such a bitch!

822
01:10:08,603 --> 01:10:11,868
You did that on purpose
just to fuck me over!

823
01:10:11,939 --> 01:10:15,569
I would do it though.
If you love someone, it's okay.

824
01:10:17,278 --> 01:10:19,041
I can't believe you.
You're so weird.

825
01:10:19,113 --> 01:10:22,082
You don't say anything all day,
and then when
you open your mouth...

826
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:24,983
you unload all these
tremendous lies all over me.

827
01:10:25,052 --> 01:10:28,579
You're just pissed off because
she got you to admit something
you didn't want to admit to.

828
01:10:28,655 --> 01:10:31,021
Okay, fine.
But that doesn't make it
any less bizarre.

829
01:10:31,091 --> 01:10:35,188
What's bizarre?
I mean, we're all
pretty bizarre.

830
01:10:35,262 --> 01:10:37,560
Some of us are just
better at hiding it, that's all.

831
01:10:37,631 --> 01:10:39,657
How are you bizarre?

832
01:10:42,036 --> 01:10:43,970
He can't think for himself.

833
01:10:46,006 --> 01:10:48,600
She's right.

834
01:10:48,676 --> 01:10:52,737
Do you guys know what, uh,
what I did to get in here?

835
01:10:54,148 --> 01:10:56,514
I taped Larry Lester's
buns together.

836
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:58,574
That was you?

837
01:10:58,653 --> 01:11:02,612
- Yeah. You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

838
01:11:02,689 --> 01:11:05,351
Then you know how hairy
he is, right?

839
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:09,722
When they pulled
the tape off...

840
01:11:09,796 --> 01:11:13,288
most of his hair came off
and some skin too.

841
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:15,699
Oh, my God.

842
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:18,533
The bizarre thing is...

843
01:11:18,605 --> 01:11:20,698
is that I did it
for my old man.

844
01:11:22,577 --> 01:11:25,273
I tortured this poor kid...

845
01:11:25,345 --> 01:11:28,144
because I wanted him
to think that I was cool.

846
01:11:30,717 --> 01:11:35,177
He's always going off about,
you know, when he was in school.

847
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:38,713
All the wild things
he used to do.

848
01:11:38,792 --> 01:11:44,628
And I got the feeling that
he was disappointed that I never
cut loose on anyone, right?

849
01:11:47,034 --> 01:11:51,028
So, I'm sittin'
in the locker room...

850
01:11:51,104 --> 01:11:53,595
and I'm taping up my knee.

851
01:11:55,342 --> 01:12:00,144
And Larry's undressing
a couple lockers down from me.

852
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:04,850
And... he's kind of...

853
01:12:04,918 --> 01:12:06,853
he's kind of skinny.

854
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:09,582
He's weak.

855
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:13,524
And I started thinking
about my father...

856
01:12:13,594 --> 01:12:17,962
and his attitude about...
about weakness.

857
01:12:18,032 --> 01:12:21,934
And the next thing I knew...

858
01:12:22,002 --> 01:12:26,201
I jumped on top of him
and started wailing on him.

859
01:12:28,109 --> 01:12:31,670
And my friends, they just laughed
and cheered me on.

860
01:12:34,614 --> 01:12:38,210
And afterwards...

861
01:12:38,286 --> 01:12:41,345
when I was sitting
in Vernon's office...

862
01:12:43,957 --> 01:12:47,121
all I could think about...

863
01:12:47,194 --> 01:12:50,721
was Larry's father...

864
01:12:50,797 --> 01:12:54,791
and Larry
having to go home...

865
01:12:54,868 --> 01:12:59,271
and... and explain
what happened to him.

866
01:13:02,476 --> 01:13:06,936
And... the humiliation...

867
01:13:07,014 --> 01:13:10,141
fucking humiliation
he must have felt.

868
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:15,581
It must have been unreal.

869
01:13:18,192 --> 01:13:22,094
I mean, how do you apologize
for something like that?

870
01:13:25,899 --> 01:13:27,833
There's no way.

871
01:13:32,006 --> 01:13:34,667
It's all because of me
and my old man.

872
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,814
God, I fucking hate him.

873
01:13:43,417 --> 01:13:48,412
He's like this...
He's like this mindless machine
that I can't relate to anymore.

874
01:13:49,923 --> 01:13:55,157
Andrew!
You've got to be number one!

875
01:13:55,229 --> 01:13:57,753
I won't tolerate any losers
in this family.

876
01:13:57,832 --> 01:14:02,632
Your intensity is for shit!
Win! Win! Win!

877
01:14:04,037 --> 01:14:06,836
You son of a bitch.

878
01:14:09,743 --> 01:14:14,203
You know sometimes
I wish my knee would give...

879
01:14:14,282 --> 01:14:17,307
then I wouldn't be able
to wrestle anymore.

880
01:14:17,385 --> 01:14:21,515
Then he could forget
all about me.

881
01:14:21,588 --> 01:14:24,819
I think your old man
and my old man should get
together and go bowling.

882
01:14:31,097 --> 01:14:33,032
It's like me, you know,
with my grades.

883
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:37,502
Like when l... when l...
when I step outside myself...

884
01:14:37,572 --> 01:14:40,837
and like when I look in
at myself, you know.

885
01:14:43,578 --> 01:14:45,738
And l... And I see me.

886
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,984
I don't like what I see.

887
01:14:52,286 --> 01:14:54,550
I really don't.

888
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:59,685
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you like yourself?

889
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,751
Sounds stupid, but...

890
01:15:05,632 --> 01:15:07,567
because I'm failing shop.

891
01:15:09,403 --> 01:15:14,067
We had this assignment,
you know, to make this,
like, ceramic elephant...

892
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,439
and we had eight weeks
to do it.

893
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:20,072
And then, you know,
we're supposed to... It was like a lamp.

894
01:15:20,146 --> 01:15:24,082
And when, you know,
when you pull it, the trunk,
the light was supposed to go on.

895
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:29,182
But my light didn't go on.

896
01:15:29,256 --> 01:15:31,384
I got an "F" on it.

897
01:15:32,627 --> 01:15:34,560
I've never got an "F" in my life.

898
01:15:35,962 --> 01:15:38,556
When I signed up, you know,
for the course, I mean...

899
01:15:38,632 --> 01:15:40,658
I thought I was playing it
real smart, you know...

900
01:15:40,734 --> 01:15:42,760
'cause I thought, you know,
I'll take shop.

901
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:45,270
It'll be such
an easy way to maintain
my grade point average.

902
01:15:45,338 --> 01:15:47,273
Why'd you think
it'd be easy?

903
01:15:49,743 --> 01:15:51,871
Have you seen some of the dopes
that take shop?

904
01:15:51,945 --> 01:15:55,881
I take shop.
You must be a fuckin' idiot.

905
01:15:55,949 --> 01:15:57,747
I'm a fuckin' idiot
'cause I can't make a lamp?

906
01:15:57,818 --> 01:16:00,377
No, you're a genius 'cause
you can't make a lamp.

907
01:16:00,453 --> 01:16:03,149
What do you know
about trigonometry?

908
01:16:03,224 --> 01:16:04,987
I could care less
about trigonometry.

909
01:16:05,059 --> 01:16:07,960
Bender, did you know
without trigonometry,
there'd be no engineering?

910
01:16:08,029 --> 01:16:09,894
Without lamps,
there'd be no light.

911
01:16:09,963 --> 01:16:13,729
Okay, so neither one of you
is any better than the other one.

912
01:16:13,801 --> 01:16:16,132
I can write with my toes.

913
01:16:16,203 --> 01:16:19,604
I can also eat,
brush my teeth...

914
01:16:19,673 --> 01:16:21,835
With your feet?

915
01:16:21,908 --> 01:16:25,002
- Play "Heart And Soul" on the piano.
- I can make spaghetti.

916
01:16:26,146 --> 01:16:28,979
What can you do?

917
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:32,314
I can, uh, tape
all of your buns together.

918
01:16:32,386 --> 01:16:35,287
I wanna see
what Claire can do.

919
01:16:35,355 --> 01:16:38,086
- I can't do anything.
- Everybody can do something.

920
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,824
There's one thing I can do.

921
01:16:42,896 --> 01:16:46,195
- No, forget it.
It's way too embarrassing.
- You ever seen Wild Kingdom?

922
01:16:46,266 --> 01:16:48,201
That guy's been doing
that show for 30 years.

923
01:16:49,502 --> 01:16:54,202
Okay. But you have to swear
to God you won't laugh.

924
01:16:57,377 --> 01:16:59,311
Okay.

925
01:17:01,215 --> 01:17:05,117
I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

926
01:17:15,796 --> 01:17:19,027
Yea!

927
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:23,627
All right. That's great!
Where'd you learn to do that?

928
01:17:23,703 --> 01:17:25,637
Camp.
Seventh grade.

929
01:17:31,278 --> 01:17:33,212
That was great, Claire.

930
01:17:34,515 --> 01:17:36,813
My image of you
is totally blown.

931
01:17:36,884 --> 01:17:41,014
You're a shit.
Don't do that to her. You swore
to God you wouldn't laugh.

932
01:17:41,087 --> 01:17:43,886
- Am I laughing?
- You fuckin' prick!

933
01:17:46,726 --> 01:17:49,695
What do you care
what I think anyway?

934
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:54,422
I don't even count,
right?

935
01:17:54,502 --> 01:17:57,231
I could disappear forever
and it wouldn't make any difference.

936
01:17:59,172 --> 01:18:03,667
I may as well not even exist
at this school, remember?

937
01:18:06,947 --> 01:18:09,779
And you...
don't like me anyway.

938
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:12,819
You know, I have
just as many feelings
as you do...

939
01:18:12,886 --> 01:18:15,412
and it hurts just as much
when somebody steps
all over them.

940
01:18:15,488 --> 01:18:17,457
God, you're so pathetic.

941
01:18:17,524 --> 01:18:22,622
Don't you ever,
ever compare yourself to me, okay?

942
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:24,688
You got everything,
and I got shit.

943
01:18:24,765 --> 01:18:27,824
Fuckin' Rapunzel, right?

944
01:18:27,902 --> 01:18:31,132
School would probably shut down
if you didn't show up.

945
01:18:31,204 --> 01:18:33,832
Queenie isn't here.

946
01:18:33,908 --> 01:18:37,469
I like those earrings,
Claire.
Shut up.

947
01:18:37,545 --> 01:18:39,979
Are those real diamonds,
Claire?
Shut up!

948
01:18:40,046 --> 01:18:43,983
I bet they are.
Did you work for the money...

949
01:18:44,051 --> 01:18:46,747
Shut your mouth!
For those earrings?

950
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:49,551
Or did your daddy
buy those for you?
Shut up!

951
01:18:49,622 --> 01:18:51,853
I bet he bought those
for you.

952
01:18:51,926 --> 01:18:55,862
I bet those were
a Christmas gift, right?

953
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:57,898
You know what I got
for Christmas this year?

954
01:18:57,965 --> 01:19:02,800
It was a banner fucking year
at the old Bender family.
I got a carton of cigarettes.

955
01:19:02,869 --> 01:19:06,362
The old man grabbed me and said,
"Hey, smoke up, Johnny."

956
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:09,170
Okay, so go home
and cry to your daddy.
Don't cry here, okay?

957
01:19:22,355 --> 01:19:24,846
My God, are we gonna
be like our parents?

958
01:19:24,925 --> 01:19:26,984
Not me.

959
01:19:29,764 --> 01:19:31,698
Ever.

960
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,768
It's unavoidable.

961
01:19:36,837 --> 01:19:39,965
It just happens.

962
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:42,007
What happens?

963
01:19:43,444 --> 01:19:47,380
When you grow up,
your heart dies.

964
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:51,885
- Who cares?
- I care.

965
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:56,519
Um, I was just thinking,
I mean...

966
01:19:56,590 --> 01:20:01,458
I know it's kind of a weird time,
but I was just wondering, um...

967
01:20:04,131 --> 01:20:06,064
what is going to happen
to us on Monday...

968
01:20:06,132 --> 01:20:08,363
when we're all
together again?

969
01:20:09,936 --> 01:20:12,497
I mean, I consider
you guys my friends.

970
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:18,139
- I'm not wrong, am I?
- No.

971
01:20:18,212 --> 01:20:21,738
So... So on Monday,
what happens?

972
01:20:21,815 --> 01:20:24,613
Are we still friends,
you mean?

973
01:20:24,685 --> 01:20:27,346
- If we're friends now, that is.
- Yeah.

974
01:20:28,855 --> 01:20:32,314
- Do you want the truth?
- Yeah, I want the truth.

975
01:20:32,393 --> 01:20:34,884
I don't think so.

976
01:20:37,331 --> 01:20:42,199
- With all of us or just John?
- With all of you.

977
01:20:42,269 --> 01:20:46,171
That's a real nice
attitude, Claire.
Oh, be honest, Andy.

978
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:50,369
If Brian came walking up to you
in the hall on Monday,
what would you do?

979
01:20:50,444 --> 01:20:53,537
I mean, picture this.
You're there with all the sports.

980
01:20:53,613 --> 01:20:56,777
You know exactly what you'd do.
You'd say hi to him,
and when he left...

981
01:20:56,850 --> 01:21:00,184
you'd cut him all up
so your friends wouldn't think
you really liked him.

982
01:21:00,253 --> 01:21:03,417
- No way.
- Okay.

983
01:21:03,489 --> 01:21:07,358
- What if I came up to you?
- Same exact thing.

984
01:21:07,427 --> 01:21:10,295
You are a bitch!

985
01:21:10,363 --> 01:21:13,697
Why, 'cause I'm telling the truth?
That makes me a bitch?

986
01:21:13,766 --> 01:21:15,792
No, you know how shitty
that is to do to someone.

987
01:21:15,869 --> 01:21:18,270
And you don't got the balls
to stand up to your friends...

988
01:21:18,338 --> 01:21:20,466
and tell them you're gonna like
who you wanna like.

989
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:22,940
Okay, what about you,
you hypocrite?

990
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,944
Why don't you take Allison
to one of your heavy metal
vomit parties?

991
01:21:26,012 --> 01:21:28,573
Or take Brian out
to the parking lot
at lunch to get high?

992
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:31,117
Or what about Andy
for that matter?
What about me?

993
01:21:31,185 --> 01:21:34,211
What would your friends say
if we were walking
down the hall together?

994
01:21:34,287 --> 01:21:37,154
They'd laugh their asses off,
and you'd tell them
you were doing it with me...

995
01:21:37,224 --> 01:21:39,158
so they'd forgive you
for being seen with me.

996
01:21:39,225 --> 01:21:41,159
Don't you ever
talk about my friends!

997
01:21:41,228 --> 01:21:44,220
You don't know any of my friends
you don't look at any of my friends...

998
01:21:44,297 --> 01:21:46,960
and you certainly
wouldn't condescend
to speak to any of my friends...

999
01:21:47,033 --> 01:21:48,967
so you just stick
to the things you know...

1000
01:21:49,036 --> 01:21:51,560
shopping, nail polish,
your father's BMW...

1001
01:21:51,639 --> 01:21:54,801
and your poor, rich,
drunk mother in the Caribbean.
Shut up!

1002
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:58,435
As far as being concerned about
what's gonna happen when you
and I walk down the hallways...

1003
01:21:58,511 --> 01:22:00,844
you can forget it,
'cause it's never gonna happen.

1004
01:22:00,914 --> 01:22:04,475
Just bury your head in the sand
and wait for your fuckin' prom!

1005
01:22:04,551 --> 01:22:07,610
I hate you!
Yeah? Good!

1006
01:22:13,894 --> 01:22:16,863
Okay, then I assume
Allison and I are better people
than you guys, huh?

1007
01:22:18,364 --> 01:22:20,492
Us weirdos.

1008
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:24,662
Would you...
Would you do that to me?

1009
01:22:24,738 --> 01:22:27,206
I don't have any friends.

1010
01:22:29,243 --> 01:22:32,609
- Well, if you did.
- No.

1011
01:22:34,981 --> 01:22:37,779
I don't think the kind of friends
I'd have would mind.

1012
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:41,014
Well, I just wanna tell...

1013
01:22:41,087 --> 01:22:43,954
each of you
that I wouldn't do that.

1014
01:22:44,024 --> 01:22:46,890
I wouldn't and I will not.

1015
01:22:48,628 --> 01:22:50,563
'Cause I think
that's real shitty.

1016
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,159
Your friends wouldn't mind
because they look up to us.

1017
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:03,032
You're so conceited, Claire.

1018
01:23:03,109 --> 01:23:05,340
You're so conceited.

1019
01:23:05,412 --> 01:23:07,641
You're so, like, full of yourself.
Why are you like that?

1020
01:23:07,715 --> 01:23:11,445
I'm not saying that
to be conceited.

1021
01:23:11,518 --> 01:23:14,850
I hate it.
I hate having to go along
with everything my friends say.

1022
01:23:14,921 --> 01:23:17,015
Well, then why do you do it?

1023
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:21,418
I don't know.
I don't...

1024
01:23:21,494 --> 01:23:24,622
You don't understand.
You don't...

1025
01:23:24,698 --> 01:23:28,759
You're not friends
with the same kinds of people
Andy and I are friends with.

1026
01:23:28,836 --> 01:23:33,500
You know, you just
don't understand the pressure
they can put on you.

1027
01:23:33,573 --> 01:23:35,542
I don't understand what?

1028
01:23:35,609 --> 01:23:39,045
You think I don't understand
pressure, Claire?

1029
01:23:39,113 --> 01:23:42,014
Well, fuck you!
Fuck you!

1030
01:23:50,056 --> 01:23:51,990
You know why I'm here today?

1031
01:23:54,094 --> 01:23:56,028
Do you?

1032
01:23:57,530 --> 01:24:01,261
I'm here...

1033
01:24:01,335 --> 01:24:06,466
because Mr. Ryan...
found a gun in my locker.

1034
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:12,569
Why'd you have
a gun in your locker?

1035
01:24:12,645 --> 01:24:14,613
I tried.

1036
01:24:16,315 --> 01:24:21,219
When you pull
the fuckin'... trunk on it,
the light's supposed to go on.

1037
01:24:21,287 --> 01:24:23,984
It didn't go on.

1038
01:24:27,226 --> 01:24:30,127
What's the gun for, Brian?
Just forget it.

1039
01:24:30,197 --> 01:24:32,323
You brought it up, man.

1040
01:24:34,435 --> 01:24:36,368
I can't have an "F."

1041
01:24:39,706 --> 01:24:44,404
I can't have it,
and I know my parents can't have it.

1042
01:24:47,914 --> 01:24:52,011
Even if I ace the rest of the semester,
I'm still only a "B. '

1043
01:24:52,086 --> 01:24:54,782
Everything's ruined for me.

1044
01:24:54,854 --> 01:24:57,585
Brian...
What?

1045
01:25:02,996 --> 01:25:05,623
Considering
my options, you know.

1046
01:25:05,698 --> 01:25:07,667
No, killing yourself
is not an option.

1047
01:25:07,734 --> 01:25:10,998
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
No, I don't think so.

1048
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:13,130
It was a handgun?

1049
01:25:13,207 --> 01:25:18,270
No, it was a flare gun.
It went off in my locker.

1050
01:25:18,345 --> 01:25:22,509
Really?

1051
01:25:22,582 --> 01:25:27,282
It's not funny.

1052
01:25:36,563 --> 01:25:41,193
Yes, it is.

1053
01:25:43,136 --> 01:25:45,662
Fuckin' elephant was destroyed.

1054
01:25:46,974 --> 01:25:50,501
You wanna know what I did
to get in here?

1055
01:25:52,779 --> 01:25:55,338
Nothing.

1056
01:25:55,414 --> 01:25:57,814
I didn't have
anything better to do.

1057
01:26:03,657 --> 01:26:05,818
You're laughing at me.

1058
01:26:05,893 --> 01:26:08,828
No!
Yeah, you are.

1059
01:26:33,186 --> 01:26:35,917
It seems so clear
in black and white

1060
01:26:35,988 --> 01:26:39,447
The living color tends
to dull our sight

1061
01:26:39,525 --> 01:26:42,859
Like dynamite

1062
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:47,560
Just imagine my surprise
when I looked into your eyes

1063
01:26:47,634 --> 01:26:52,832
And saw
through your disguise

1064
01:26:52,905 --> 01:26:57,137
If we dare expose
our hearts and just reveal
the purest thoughts

1065
01:26:57,211 --> 01:27:02,148
That's when strange sensations
start to grow

1066
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:05,310
Oh, we are not alone

1067
01:27:05,385 --> 01:27:07,579
You find out where
you're coming from

1068
01:27:07,654 --> 01:27:13,251
There'll be somebody there
to break your fall

1069
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:15,295
We are not alone

1070
01:27:15,362 --> 01:27:18,057
'Cause when you come down
through the fold

1071
01:27:18,131 --> 01:27:22,430
We're really not
so different after all

1072
01:27:54,501 --> 01:27:57,527
Brian?
Hmm.

1073
01:27:57,604 --> 01:28:00,970
Are you gonna
write your paper?
Yeah. Why?

1074
01:28:03,109 --> 01:28:07,011
Well, it's kind of a waste
for all of us to write
our paper, don't you think?

1075
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:09,014
Well, that's what Vernon
wants us to do.

1076
01:28:09,082 --> 01:28:13,347
True.
 But I think we'd all kind of say the same thing.

1077
01:28:14,755 --> 01:28:17,849
You just don't wanna
write your paper, right?

1078
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:21,882
True, but you're
the smartest, right?

1079
01:28:21,962 --> 01:28:25,921
Well. Um...
We trust you.

1080
01:28:29,101 --> 01:28:31,161
Yeah.

1081
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:37,176
All right.
I'll do it.

1082
01:28:38,278 --> 01:28:40,212
Great.

1083
01:28:52,525 --> 01:28:54,551
Come on.

1084
01:28:54,627 --> 01:28:57,596
Where we going?
Come on.

1085
01:28:59,599 --> 01:29:03,432
Don't be afraid.

1086
01:29:03,502 --> 01:29:05,595
Don't stick that
in my eye.
I'm not sticking...

1087
01:29:05,671 --> 01:29:08,402
Just close it. Wait a minute.
Just go like... go like that.

1088
01:29:10,444 --> 01:29:15,006
Good.

1089
01:29:15,082 --> 01:29:18,108
You know, you really do
look better without all
that black shit on your eyes.

1090
01:29:18,185 --> 01:29:20,881
Hey, I like
that black shit.

1091
01:29:22,221 --> 01:29:24,417
This looks a lot better.

1092
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:26,425
Look up.

1093
01:29:34,835 --> 01:29:38,703
Please. Why are you
being so nice to me?

1094
01:29:38,771 --> 01:29:40,706
'Cause you're letting me.

1095
01:29:58,492 --> 01:30:00,721
You lost?

1096
01:30:51,545 --> 01:30:54,207
Thank you.

1097
01:31:01,755 --> 01:31:04,154
Why'd you do that?

1098
01:31:04,224 --> 01:31:07,386
'Cause I knew
you wouldn't.

1099
01:31:07,461 --> 01:31:11,726
You know how you said before
how your parents use you
to get back at each other?

1100
01:31:11,797 --> 01:31:14,323
Wouldn't I be outstanding
in that capacity?

1101
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:19,899
Were you really disgusted
about what I did
with my lipstick?

1102
01:31:21,006 --> 01:31:24,670
Truth?
Truth.

1103
01:31:24,743 --> 01:31:26,677
No.

1104
01:31:36,722 --> 01:31:39,555
What happened to you?

1105
01:31:39,626 --> 01:31:43,391
Why?
Claire did it.

1106
01:31:47,067 --> 01:31:49,557
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

1107
01:31:49,636 --> 01:31:55,198
It's just... you're just
so different, you know.

1108
01:31:55,274 --> 01:31:58,368
I can see your face.

1109
01:31:58,444 --> 01:32:00,378
Is that good or bad?

1110
01:32:01,814 --> 01:32:04,010
That's good.

1111
01:32:18,832 --> 01:32:20,958
See ya, Brian.
Hey, Carl.

1112
01:32:22,269 --> 01:32:24,828
See ya next Saturday.
You bet.

1113
01:32:34,146 --> 01:32:38,015
Won't you
come see about me

1114
01:32:38,083 --> 01:32:42,817
I'll be alone, dancing
you know it, baby

1115
01:32:42,889 --> 01:32:46,756
Tell me
your troubles and doubts

1116
01:32:46,826 --> 01:32:51,819
Giving me everything
inside and out and

1117
01:32:51,898 --> 01:32:55,628
Love's strange
so real in the dark

1118
01:32:55,702 --> 01:33:00,537
Think of the tender things
that we were working on

1119
01:33:00,606 --> 01:33:04,565
Slow change
may pull us apart

1120
01:33:04,644 --> 01:33:09,274
When the light
gets into your heart, baby

1121
01:33:09,349 --> 01:33:11,817
Don't you

1122
01:33:11,885 --> 01:33:15,752
Forget about me

1123
01:33:15,822 --> 01:33:18,381
Don't, don't, don't, don't

1124
01:33:18,457 --> 01:33:20,756
Don't you

1125
01:33:20,827 --> 01:33:22,920
Forget about me

1126
01:33:26,099 --> 01:33:30,865
Will you stand above me

1127
01:33:30,936 --> 01:33:35,373
Look my way
but never love me

1128
01:33:35,442 --> 01:33:40,243
Rain keeps falling
Rain keeps falling

1129
01:33:40,313 --> 01:33:44,373
Down, down, down

1130
01:33:44,451 --> 01:33:48,581
Will you recognize me

1131
01:33:48,654 --> 01:33:52,318
Call my name
or walk on by

1132
01:33:52,391 --> 01:33:57,853
As the rain keeps falling
Rain keeps falling

1133
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:00,797
Down, down, down

1134
01:34:04,037 --> 01:34:07,631
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1135
01:34:07,707 --> 01:34:10,198
Ooh

1136
01:34:10,275 --> 01:34:13,301
"Dear Mr. Vernon...

1137
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:16,177
"We accept the fact that
we had to sacrifice a whole
Saturday in detention...

1138
01:34:16,248 --> 01:34:18,682
"for whatever it was
we did wrong...

1139
01:34:18,752 --> 01:34:22,779
"but we think you're crazy to
make us write an essay telling
you who we think we are.

1140
01:34:22,855 --> 01:34:25,221
"You see us
as you wanna see us...

1141
01:34:25,291 --> 01:34:28,920
"in the simplest terms
with the most convenient
definitions.

1142
01:34:28,994 --> 01:34:33,454
"But what we found out
is that each one of us is a brain...

1143
01:34:33,533 --> 01:34:35,466
"And an athlete...

1144
01:34:35,534 --> 01:34:37,469
"And a basket case...

1145
01:34:37,537 --> 01:34:40,164
- princess...
- And a criminal.

1146
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:43,470
"Does that answer your question?

1147
01:34:43,542 --> 01:34:48,344
Sincerely yours,
The Breakfast Club. '

1148
01:34:48,414 --> 01:34:51,077
Don't, don't, don't, don't

1149
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:53,448
Don't you

1150
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,216
Forget about me

1151
01:34:57,856 --> 01:35:00,552
As you walk on by

1152
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,112
