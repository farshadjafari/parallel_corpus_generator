1
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,168
Dahlia, let's go inside now.

2
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,616
She'll come soon,
but let's go inside now.

3
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,416
What are we gonna do,
Dahlia?

4
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,254
What are we gonna do
about your mother always being so late?

5
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,690
- Hi.
- Hi.

6
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,536
Did you ring?

7
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,690
It's not 11.

8
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,896
You didn't ring.

9
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,653
Good. You're early.
You can come right in.

10
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,934
- You've been subletting?
- Right.

11
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,217
When my construction company moved
to New York, the rents were outta sight,

12
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,370
so we only took
a one-year lease.

13
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,575
And when my wife
asked me to leave,

14
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,220
I got a small one-bedroom
in Jersey City that's cheap.

15
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,575
- How much?
- 800.

16
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,173
Where will Cecilia sleep then?

17
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,979
There's a pullout couch in the living room,
so when she comes to stay with me,

18
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,416
I'll sleep there.
I can't afford two bedrooms.

19
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,968
How 'bout you, Dahlia? We need to know
what your situation is gonna be.

20
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,893
Any luck in finding a suitable place
for you and Cecilia?

21
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,858
- I'm looking at apartments today.
- Where?

22
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,454
- Where?
- I told you, I'm moving to Jersey City.

23
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,850
There's a school there, it's great. And
there's plenty of cheap places to rent, so...

24
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,489
You got an apartment near me, it would
make the shared custody easier.

25
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,933
Why do you want her, Kyle?

26
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,773
- What do you mean, "Why do I want her?"
- You were never interested in her before.

27
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,294
- What?
- You know, he forgot her fifth birthday.

28
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,018
- No. No, I didn't.
- No?

29
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,888
No, I didn't. The plane was stuck
on the tarmac, and we didn't have a gate.

30
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,938
I told you a million times,
the phones didn't work.

31
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,488
No one believes you, cos everyone
knows what you were doing.

32
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,616
- "Everyone"? No, you. Only you.
- OK.

33
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,214
You see? She's crazy.
You live in a world of your own.

34
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,177
I make one mistake,
and I don't care about Ceci?

35
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,251
- You don't like playing with her.
- You're insane. You're insane.

36
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,936
Be honest with yourself. You can't raise
Ceci alone. You can't handle it.

37
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,853
Just be honest with yourself.

38
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,936
Isn't it funny
how small the cars look?

39
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,454
- Yeah.
- If you look at them from up here.

40
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,100
Fit them between your fingers,
if you squint.

41
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,932
Yeah.

42
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,412
Oh, look.
There's a tram.

43
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,857
And that's where we're going,
Roosevelt Island.

44
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,578
Mommy, that's not the city.

45
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,696
Sure it is.
Just a different part of the city.

46
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,739
No, that's the city over there.
That's not the city.

47
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,334
- She's right.
- Mm-hm.

48
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,450
Here we are.

49
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,451
It is chilly, though, isn't it?
Are you cold?

50
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,655
Yeah, a little bit.

51
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,050
Yeah? Hey, look,
that's where you'd go to school.

52
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,495
I don't want
to go to school here.

53
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,899
Why not?

54
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,175
It's too small.

55
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,615
Oh, I see.

56
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,815
Mm-hm.

57
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,414
- You know, I got your snack for ya.
- You do?

58
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,411
Yeah. Are you hungry now?
Do you want it now?

59
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,934
- Maybe I'll wait.
- OK.

60
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,659
Let's just check.

61
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,458
Let's see.

62
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,734
540...

63
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,095
Just...

64
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,899
40...

65
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,255
That way.

66
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,888
OK.

67
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,136
It's nice here.
It's like a small town.

68
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,256
I like the big city better.

69
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,093
Why didn't we rent that last place?
That was really nice.

70
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,729
It was. It was too expensive for us, honey.
We need something that's a better price.

71
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,459
But I don't want
to live here, Mommy.

72
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,100
Why not, Ceci?

73
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,297
It's all the same.
And it's small. Too small.

74
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,496
"It's too small"?
I think you're too small.

75
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,377
- No, I'm not. I'm big.
- Small.

76
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,973
- I'm big.
- OK, good.

77
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,016
Then are you gonna be a big girl,
and give this one a chance?

78
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,818
Yeah? Cos otherwise
you know what happens?

79
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,252
What?

80
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,858
My itsy-bitsy muffin. I cover you all up
with jam like this, and then...

81
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,976
And then eat you up.

82
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,498
OK. That's us.

83
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,492
We are a little bit early.

84
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,333
We need...
Oh, golly. Five...

85
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,611
- Hi.
- Hi.

86
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,772
- Are you Mrs. Bernstein?
- No, I'm Ms Williams.

87
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,489
Ah, Ms Williams. Oh, you're early.
Mr. Murray. We spoke on the phone.

88
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,174
Listen, since the Bernsteins aren't here,
I can show you the apartment now.

89
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,613
You're lucky to get
a jump on them, actually.

90
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,769
OK, that'd be great.

91
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,259
- So we'll just go up, and...
- Thanks.

92
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,729
- Hello.
- Hi.

93
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,212
These tend to go pretty quick.

94
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,372
You know, Manhattan is so expensive,
and this is practically in Manhattan.

95
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,011
- I mean, it's five minutes away.
- Yucky. This is yucky.

96
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,855
It is yucky down here, which is why we are
repainting all these lobbies this summer.

97
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,774
And I think they're replacing all the doors, if
I'm not mistaken. It'll make it a lot brighter.

98
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,499
This is Mr. Veeck.
He is the super for building C.

99
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,172
Hello.

100
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,694
Mr. Veeck,
can you say hello?

101
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,008
- Hello.
- This is... What's your name?

102
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,614
- Dahlia. This is Ceci.
- I'm sorry. Dahlia and Ceci.

103
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,294
Uh... Mr. Veeck lives in 1 A.
He's been here for 20 years.

104
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,779
He'll fix anything
that goes wrong.

105
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,373
- Oh, that's good.
- Which is a big savings,

106
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,530
cos he does it for free.

107
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,134
There's also a doorman on duty
from four to midnight here,

108
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,372
so you don't have to worry about
coming in late. And that is the lobby.

109
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,294
Mr. Veeck, if the Bernsteins show up,
just send them right up to 9F.

110
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,654
- OK.
- 9F.

111
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,412
OK.

112
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,173
OK, so,
we'll just head up here.

113
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,410
- Did you take the Tram?
- Yeah.

114
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,809
- Oh, you did. Did you like that?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,018
You get to do that every day
when you live in this building.

116
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,814
Oh, yeah. There's the camera.
Say hi. Mr. Veeck is watching us.

117
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,132
I'm gonna take you up to nine. Almost our
top floor. I call it the lower penthouse level.

118
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,892
Um...
You get some city views up there.

119
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,292
A little cut off,
but you can still see the city lights, at night.

120
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,814
Oh, you know,
we're two blocks from the school,

121
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,049
which is one of the best
in the city.

122
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,653
Yeah, I was just reading that.

123
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,617
- Isn't that great?
- No.

124
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,339
- I don't like it here, Mommy. I wanna...
- Ceci, please.

125
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,218
- Sorry, Mommy.
- That's OK.

126
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,938
It's OK.
You're gonna love it up here.

127
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,491
And they just opened a pizza place on
the island. Do you like pizza? I bet you do.

128
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,970
I like pizza, too.
I like it a little bit too much.

129
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,449
Wait, sweetie.
Don't run. Don't run.

130
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,896
What the...

131
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,891
Get stuck in here, huh?

132
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,529
- Mommy, what happened?
- Sorry. It's all right.

133
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,817
Dammit.
Another puddle.

134
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,688
Sorry about that. I keep telling Mr. Veeck
he's gotta mop in there every morning.

135
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,577
You know,
with all this rain we're having,

136
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,174
you can't stop some of it
coming down that elevator shaft.

137
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,969
There's just no way to stop it.
Anyway, here's 9F down here.

138
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,655
The building was built in 1976
by Stern-Jackson and associates,

139
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,412
in the brutalist style.

140
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,493
Um... Now, what they were trying to create,
as you can see, was kind of a little village,

141
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,935
kind of a Utopia, actually,
is what they had in mind.

142
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,534
And some of those ideas
have come together.

143
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,740
Some of their original plans for the place
were a little crazy, if you ask me, actually.

144
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,811
Hello.

145
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,494
Yeah, I just do that
just in case. It's vacant.

146
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,899
- Come on in.
- Shall I close this?

147
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,256
Yeah. Let me just apologize in advance.
The place is in a little bit of a mess.

148
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,489
Our last tenant
was a little messy,

149
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,458
but we're gonna put a fresh new
coat of paint on this whole place.

150
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,657
It's gonna brighten it up quite a bit.
Let's take a look at your bedroom, sweetie.

151
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,334
This could be your room
if Mommy wants it to be.

152
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,015
- What do you think? Isn't that great?
- There's no air in here.

153
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,570
Of course there's air in here. If there
wasn't air, we wouldn't be able to breathe.

154
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,369
Uh... That window does not open, but it lets
a lot of natural light in in the afternoons.

155
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,018
- It's really great.
- Strange.

156
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,570
I kinda like it. In the afternoon,
it brightens the place up quite a bit.

157
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,457
Anyway, here's the closet.

158
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,251
You could put your dollies in there,
or, you know, Mom could use it for storage.

159
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,170
- Lemme show you the bathroom. OK?
- OK.

160
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,933
Come on, honey.
Is this another closet here?

161
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,978
Yeah, that's the foyer closet.

162
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,497
The bathroom's pretty self-explanatory.
It's in decent shape. Once we clean it up.

163
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,571
You got the toilet, of course,
the sink, bathtub.

164
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,015
This glass is safety glass.

165
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,695
I mean, you could hit that
as hard as you want, it will not break.

166
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,692
And that is great for your peace of mind,
you know, when Ceci's taking a bath.

167
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,651
Hey, Ceci.
Come look in here.

168
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,773
Ah, you're right. That's much better.
You can smell the river. Can you smell it?

169
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,852
- Yeah.
- Let me show you the other bedroom here.

170
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,249
You know, it's tough
to get two bedrooms in Manhattan,

171
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,218
any of the boroughs,
for under a thousand dollars.

172
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,372
OK, that's a closet.
Scratch that. That's a closet.

173
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,611
Um... Kitchen.

174
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,817
Got the refrigerator,
sink, stove,

175
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,610
and this is kind of
a country eat-in dining room.

176
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,533
You see this.
It's just really smart how they did this.

177
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,373
See that little thing?
Boom - dining room.

178
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,337
You can put your stools around it,
and when you're done -

179
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,297
out of the way, no clutter.

180
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,419
The dishwasher, if you're entertaining,
very convenient to have.

181
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,616
Kitchen. OK.

182
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,373
And then here
is the other bedroom.

183
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,171
So, where's the living room?

184
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,693
Well, it's kind of
a living room slash bedroom.

185
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,489
It's called a dual-use room. You can see
it's the size of two rooms. It's huge.

186
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,174
Anyway, did you see the view?
Did you see that?

187
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,252
Look at that. That is a million-dollar view
for $900 a month.

188
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,251
I mean,
I don't even have that where I live.

189
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,855
You're not gonna do better than that,
I guarantee it.

190
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,055
Listen, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase here.

191
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,530
We could have this painted this weekend.
You could move in on Monday,

192
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,736
and, you know,
we could just fill out the forms right now.

193
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,176
I understand - you want some time
to walk around, think about it.

194
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,171
- Let me just check on Ceci.
- Sure, sure. Yeah.

195
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,852
Ceci.

196
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,171
She's just making herself at home.
That's OK, Mom.

197
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,376
Ceci.

198
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,735
You know how they are.
She's just exploring.

199
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,010
- Mr. Veeck. Mr. Veeck.
- Did my daughter come down here?

200
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,930
- What?
- My daughter.

201
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,375
- The little girl I came in with.
- The little girl. Did she get on the elevator?

202
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,815
No. I see no one.
Just him.

203
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,097
Yeah, there was a little girl
in the stairwell.

204
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,134
Ceci.

205
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,171
Ceci.

206
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,576
Ceci.

207
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,929
Ceci.

208
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,250
Are you in there?

209
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,854
- Hello.
- Yeah?

210
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,135
- What are you doing down here?
- I saw someone go in.

211
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,099
Did you check the stairs
all the way to the roof?

212
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,133
Ceci.

213
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,536
Look, Mommy.
Hello Kitty. I got a Hello Kitty bag.

214
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,578
Ceci. Don't you ever do that again.
Do you understand?

215
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,369
Don't you ever run away from me,
and you never come up on the roof.

216
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,772
- Sorry.
- Do you understand me?

217
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,658
It's not safe for you up here.
You could have fallen.

218
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,651
- Sorry, Mommy.
- OK?

219
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,255
How can you leave this unlocked? There's
no railing here. It's totally irresponsible.

220
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,298
- It's supposed to be locked.
- Well, it wasn't.

221
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,098
Yeah. Sorry.

222
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,296
- Are you OK, honey?
- Yeah.

223
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,660
You're so lucky you found that.

224
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,176
My niece loves Hello Kitty.
Did you look inside it?

225
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,820
- No. Mommy, can I look?
- It's not yours, sweetie.

226
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,972
Oh, I'm sure she can keep it. There's no
other children in the building. Someone...

227
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,257
No children?
Why? It's so close to the school.

228
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,173
They all grew up.
You know, they're all teenagers now.

229
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,218
You know, hardly anybody
ever moves out cos of rent control.

230
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,258
Oh, there are other children on the island.
You know, in the other buildings.

231
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,174
You would have
many, many friends.

232
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,216
So cute.

233
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,451
Mr. Veeck, why was the door
to the roof open?

234
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,689
- What?
- The roof.

235
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,816
My daughter
found this on the roof.

236
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,539
- The roof? Where?
- Just lying there.

237
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,612
Mr. Veeck. Why didn't you
lock the door to the roof?

238
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,179
- I did.
- No.

239
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,615
She opened it and walked right out.
Now, what if she'd gotten hurt?

240
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,498
That's negligence, Mr. Veeck,
and I'll call the union myself.

241
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,889
You get fired for cause,
and you can kiss that pension goodbye.

242
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,450
What do you talk about?
I check it. Hour ago, it was locked.

243
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,258
- Someone else open it.
- Well, whose bag is this?

244
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,730
- What do I know?
- Well, look inside it, please.

245
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,299
I'm so sorry about this.

246
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,736
As you can see, we're having a little bit of a
communication problem. We'll work it out.

247
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,572
I was wondering
if you have a card, so...

248
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,855
Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.

249
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,658
- Just don't wait too long.
- Hey. Hey.

250
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,812
Ceci.
That's not yours. OK?

251
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,131
You can't keep that. Look, it's brand-new.
Someone's gonna come back for it.

252
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,450
Can you give it back,
please?

253
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,019
- Doll.
- Ceci.

254
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,978
- Aw. Poor thing.
- Good girl. Thank you.

255
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,133
I'll tell you what. Mr. Veeck will hold onto it
for a week, and if no one comes,

256
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,131
then you can come by
and get it. OK?

257
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,290
- In one week.
- No one comes, it's yours.

258
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,893
You see? You'll see,
no one will come.

259
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,540
Thank you, Mr. Veeck.
Please check on that lock again.

260
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,178
Thank you.

261
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,978
We're gonna live here,
right, Mommy?

262
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,528
- What?
- We're gonna move here, right?

263
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,736
I want to.
I really wanna move here.

264
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,209
See?
From the mouths of babes.

265
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,259
- Excuse me just one moment.
- OK.

266
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,568
Talk about it, I guess.

267
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,448
Now, we don't have to move here
for you to get a Hello Kitty backpack.

268
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,689
- I know that.
- You know that?

269
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,056
I really like this place, Mommy.
I wanna live here.

270
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,859
You said it was
the right kind of price for us.

271
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,535
I did say that.
It's a little bit smaller than I hoped.

272
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,214
Please, Mommy.
Can we live here?

273
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,814
I'm over here.
Over here.

274
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,379
Over here.

275
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,776
- We'll take it.
- Oh, I have the Bernsteins...

276
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,454
I'll give you a deposit right now.

277
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,931
- You're sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

278
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,658
- OK.
- OK.

279
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,812
Yeah. I have the forms here, if you want.
We can go in... Let's go back in the office.

280
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,539
OK. Ceci,
you wanna come?

281
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,057
I'll be right back. I can explain to them.
That's all right. They have a lot of choices.

282
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:31,538
Come on.

283
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,973
Cos it's insanely inconvenient,
that's why.

284
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,416
I gotta drive through the tunnel, get uptown
to cross the 59th Street Bridge to Queens,

285
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,695
so I can cross another goddamn bridge
to get to the island.

286
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,179
- You could take the subway.
- The subway?

287
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,616
You want me to take the PATH to the F?
Are you kidding me? It’ll take an hour.

288
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,416
I'm suing.

289
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,252
- What?
- You move there, I'll sue for full custody.

290
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,252
Mr. Williams.
Threats are not appropriate.

291
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,490
- Ms Williams has a right to rent...
- Are you moving to Roosevelt Island?

292
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,808
- Look at this.
- I want an answer.

293
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,892
Look at this. The elementary school there
is one of the best in the city,

294
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,575
and it's practically next door, so all Ceci
would have to do is walk two blocks.

295
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,094
Just look at it.

296
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,648
If this is really about Ceci, maybe
you could move to Roosevelt Island,

297
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,970
cos there are
lots of places for rent there.

298
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,937
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it? Why?

299
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,375
- I already signed a lease.
- You're lying.

300
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,939
- I'm not listening to this.
- She's there.

301
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,409
She's in Jersey City,
and that's what this is really about.

302
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,298
I'm done talking.
Better get yourself a lawyer.

303
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,450
A good one.

304
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,099
I'm sorry to say
that's good advice.

305
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,817
- Nobody came, right?
- What?

306
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,095
The Hello Kitty bag.
Nobody came, right?

307
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,776
It's only been four days, kid.
Don't get your hopes up.

308
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,169
Hey.

309
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,216
- Hello.
- Hello.

310
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,292
- After you, my love.
- Thank you.

311
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,295
Let's try...

312
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,178
- In here?
- No.

313
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,290
I'm ready for something to drink.
How about you?

314
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,178
Or maybe something to eat.

315
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,694
Ooh, let's put you in the box.

316
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,092
Can you
hold your breath underwater?

317
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,216
- Yeah.
- You can?

318
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,575
How long do you think
you can hold it for?

319
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,218
- Seven.
- Really?

320
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,777
Uh-huh.

321
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,294
Look, Mommy.
Look how high I can jump.

322
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,894
Are you trying to break your new bed
on the first night?

323
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,652
- No.
- Don't break your bed.

324
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,096
OK. Look, Mommy.
I'm gonna reach the ceiling.

325
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,973
What is that?

326
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,176
Looks like a leak.

327
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,818
How?

328
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,656
I'll have to tell them about that
in the morning.

329
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,168
Horrible.

330
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,854
Anyway, what shall we read?

331
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,571
Wow.

332
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,776
The sound really carries.

333
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,293
Yeah.

334
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,929
- Mommy.
- Hm?

335
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,773
- Can you fix my hair?
- I'd love to fix your hair.

336
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,892
What do you want?
Do you want a ponytail? Or a braid?

337
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,090
- A braid.
- OK.

338
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,695
You wanna practice for today?

339
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,771
OK.

340
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,055
Boys and girls,

341
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,610
today I want you to meet
your new classmate.

342
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,979
Her name is Cecilia Williams.
Everyone say hello to Cecilia.

343
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,018
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi.

344
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,133
I think
you can do better than that.

345
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,495
Do you wanna try again?

346
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,218
OK.

347
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,011
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi, everybody.

348
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,011
That's my girl.

349
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,335
That's my smart,
beautiful, beautiful girl.

350
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,935
How's that?

351
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,488
It's perfect.
You do it perfect.

352
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,292
You get your shoes on,
which are right there.

353
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,974
Keys, which are...

354
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,135
I know where they are.

355
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,695
Shit. Shit!

356
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,452
- Mommy.
- What?

357
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,929
- You cursed.
- Put your shoes on, OK?

358
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,453
OK.

359
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,218
- Do you need help with those?
- Yeah.

360
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,815
Pick up your finger paints
from the back of the room.

361
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,131
Remember to mix the colors.
Red and yellow make...

362
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,098
- Orange.
- Great.

363
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,648
Good morning. Hi.

364
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,289
Hi, Cecilia. You know what?
We are gonna have so much fun today.

365
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,655
We're finger-painting,
so we're gonna get all messy. Look. See?

366
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,493
- The messier the better.
- That's fine.

367
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,775
Are you ready to come
meet all your new friends?

368
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,818
Great. Why don't you come with me,
sweetheart?

369
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,050
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Wanna say goodbye to your mama?

370
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,210
Bye, darling girl.

371
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,572
- I'll be here at 3:30 to pick you up.
- Love you, Mommy.

372
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,493
Oh, I love you so much.
Go have fun.

373
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,650
Come on, sweetheart.

374
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,731
OK, everybody.
Listen up, now.

375
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:13,168
I want you to give a big, warm, huge
welcome to our new friend Cecilia.

376
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:18,971
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi, everybody. I'm Cecilia.

377
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,018
Hi, Cecilia.

378
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,455
Wow, that was great.

379
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,252
- You want the elevator?
- Uh... Actually, I was looking for you. Um...

380
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,900
There's a leak
in my bedroom ceiling.

381
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,096
Breaking news, huh?

382
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,059
Pipes is 30 years old.
Leaks all over the building.

383
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,454
So does that mean
you won't fix it?

384
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,091
Fix a leak? Look,
all I can do is patch up the ceiling.

385
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,172
If you wanna fix the leak,
you gotta get Murray to call a plumber.

386
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,251
- Mr. Murray.
- Mr. Murray.

387
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,490
OK. I'll call him.

388
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,855
Do.

389
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,532
OK.

390
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,016
So, you worked
as a copy editor?

391
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,775
Yeah. Back in Seattle,
I did copy editing and some fact checking.

392
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,375
Why do you want this job? Pay's
not that good, sure as hell ain't interesting.

393
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,294
Oh, I'd try something different, you know?
I've always been interested in medicine.

394
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,452
Medicine?
Oh, honey, this ain't medicine.

395
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,691
See, what you do is you Xerox
their insurance card, hand them a form,

396
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,819
and give them
a pitcher of bug-juice to drink.

397
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,175
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

398
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,850
Come on, you can tell me.
I'm not exactly a model citizen.

399
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,809
I'm separated from my husband.

400
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,097
My daughter and I
just moved to Roosevelt Island.

401
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,489
You're a five-minute subway ride,

402
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,778
the hours are perfect,
and you have a medical plan.

403
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,657
Well, you're hired, honey.
But you gotta promise me one thing.

404
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,138
What?

405
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,098
In six months' time,
when you find a better job,

406
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,489
please take me with you.

407
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,253
OK. Thank you.

408
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,659
- Hello.
- Hi. Mr. Murray?

409
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,935
- Yeah.
- Hi. It's Dahlia Williams.

410
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,976
- Dahlia Williams.
- From 9F.

411
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,334
- 9F.
- Yeah.

412
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,569
Hey,
how was that paint job?

413
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,729
- Yeah...
- Great work, right?

414
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,177
Thank you, but, um... Actually,
I have a leak in my bedroom ceiling.

415
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,693
- A leak?
- Yeah.

416
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,895
Did you tell Mr. Veeck?

417
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,653
I did, I told him.
He said that he could patch the ceiling,

418
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,334
but that to repair the leak,
you would need to call a plumber.

419
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,853
I don't know
what he's talking about.

420
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,010
If he needs to open the ceiling
and fix the pipe, he can do it.

421
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,853
He doesn't need a plumber.
Listen up.

422
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,219
Just tell him I said... Just tell him
Mr. Murray said that he should fix the leak.

423
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,018
OK. I'll... I'll try.

424
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,933
Listen, say hello
to little Cathy for me, too, OK?

425
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,214
Ceci.

426
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,528
Ceci. I'm sorry.

427
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,450
OK.

428
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,373
OK. Bye-bye.

429
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,209
Yes!

430
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,729
- Hi.
- It's lunch hour.

431
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,731
Just quickly.
I spoke to Mr. Murray,

432
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,288
and he said that you should
fix that leak that I told you about.

433
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,770
Look, I'm not a plumber.
I keep telling him.

434
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,816
I'm not responsible
for building's plumbing.

435
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,936
My job is make sure
boiler's working,

436
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,250
mop floors, put out the garbage,
but I'm not a plumber.

437
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,810
No, I understand. It's just Murray said
that you could fix it.

438
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,970
Well, I can't.

439
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,534
- Hello.
- Wouldn't stop, right? Took you up to ten?

440
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,259
Yeah, it does that sometimes. It just
goes up to ten, no one's even called for it.

441
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,457
I think when it rains a lot, it messes with
the contacts or something. Which floor?

442
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,292
- Nine, please.
- OK, we'll take you back up,

443
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,415
and then I'll go down.

444
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,013
OK. Thank you.

445
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,091
Shit. Come on.

446
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,650
Who did this?

447
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,816
This building is falling apart.

448
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,575
- Bye.
- See ya later.

449
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,292
I've talked to Veeck
twice now,

450
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,610
and he says he's not a plumber
and he can't fix it,

451
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,329
so I'm wondering, is there a super from
one of the other buildings who could do it?

452
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,457
I can't do that.
See, C is Veeck, and Veeck is C.

453
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,250
If I do that, then I have the union screaming
at me about violating work rules.

454
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:54,050
It's really coming down now, and I can
hear there's running water upstairs, so...

455
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,893
You know, it might not even be a leak.
It might be flooded or something.

456
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,778
- Did you say "upstairs"?
- Right above me.

457
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,498
- In 10F?
- Upstairs.

458
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,617
You know, maybe it's their tub that's
overflowed or something, I don't know.

459
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,849
No, that can't be right.

460
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,898
Listen, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna call Mr. Veeck personally, OK?

461
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,049
I'm gonna take care of this.

462
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,290
So don't worry about it.
I'm gonna get right on it.

463
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,168
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now. I'll call
you later, as soon as I take care of it, OK?

464
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,138
- Thank you.
- OK. No problem. Bye-bye.

465
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,777
Mommy, wake up.

466
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,296
Ceci?

467
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,411
Hello.

468
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,731
Hello.

469
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,134
Hello.

470
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,053
Oh, God.

471
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,171
Oh, God.

472
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,013
What are you doing here?

473
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,295
Take it easy.

474
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,018
It's flooded.

475
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,092
The fuckin' brats.
I'm gonna kill 'em.

476
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,091
- You see them coming outta here?
- Who?

477
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:34,810
Asshole Steve. 3F.
And his buddy, dumb Billy, 7E.

478
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,299
- You don't know them?
- No.

479
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,450
Look.
Here's the story.

480
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,294
10F's away.
Father's left the country.

481
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,814
Where the mother is,
God knows.

482
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,375
They've been away for months.
Probably not coming back.

483
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,416
Those punks have stolen a key
and get in here.

484
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,297
- Why?
- What do I know?

485
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,929
Drugs.
Wacky baccy, you know.

486
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,979
Look, I clean up this place, and then...
Then I come down to your place, huh?

487
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,416
Murray called me.
I tell him I take care of it.

488
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,290
Yeah. I patch it up tomorrow,
when it's dry.

489
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,336
- No extra charge, you know?
- Thank you.

00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,297
<i>- Went up the waterspout
- Then what?</i>

492
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,336
<i>Down came the rain</i>

493
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,456
<i>- And it washed the spider out
- OK.</i>

494
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,416
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

495
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,536
You can be 10,
even 15 minutes late.

496
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,817
We have this after-school program
that runs until 5:30, so...

497
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,858
- Many of the kids stay for it.
- Uh... Is there a charge for that?

498
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,613
It's $30 a week.

499
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,260
- Which is actually quite reasonable.
- No, that's good. That's good.

500
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,377
I think I'll have to do that,
cos I'll be working till five every day.

501
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,371
- OK. Well, we can set that up.
- OK.

502
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,976
Surprise, surprise, there's another form
you have to fill out, but we can do that now.

503
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,618
This will be good for Cecilia.

504
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,932
It will help her fit in faster, and she could
use some real friends, don't you think?

505
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,896
What do you mean?

506
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,131
Well, it's not unusual
to have imaginary friends at this age.

507
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,017
Nowadays we know
not to bug them about it,

508
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:13,332
but it isn't so great
that she's playing with an imaginary friend

509
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,775
when there are real children
for her to play with here.

510
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,613
Are you saying
that Ceci has an imaginary friend?

511
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,895
<i>And washed the spider out</i>

512
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,610
<i>Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain</i>

513
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,772
<i>And the itsy-bitsy spider</i>

514
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,819
<i>Went up the spout again</i>

515
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,937
I made you a snack for after school.
I had it all wrapped up and ready to go,

516
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,817
and then I was rushing,
and I forgot it.

517
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,856
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

518
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,530
- What did you think of your teacher?
- She was very nice.

519
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,975
- Did you make any friends today?
- Uh-huh.

520
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,812
Who?

521
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,298
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

522
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,052
Very funny name
for a friend, "Nobody. "

523
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,529
- Mommy.
- Nobody. "My name is Nobody. "

524
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,497
- Did anyone come?
- What?

525
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,650
For Hello Kitty.
Did anyone come?

526
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,412
No. Not yet.

527
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,809
Thanks for taking care of the ceiling
tomorrow. I appreciate it.

528
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,175
It looks really ugly now.

529
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,818
Good.

530
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,256
Are you gonna stay
in my bed tonight?

531
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,776
Close your eyes.

532
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,129
I'm very proud of you
for today.

533
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,376
Sweet dreams, honey.

534
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:41,893
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider</i>

535
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,053
<i>Went up the waterspout</i>

536
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,655
<i>Down came the rain</i>

537
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,176
<i>And washed the spider out</i>

538
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,616
<i>Out came the sun</i>

539
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,976
<i>And dried up all the rain</i>

540
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:05,690
<i>- The itsy-bitsy spider
- Itsy-bitsy spider...</i>

541
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,410
<i>- Went up the spout again
- ... the spout again</i>

542
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,698
Well, I still don't really know anyone here,
so I'm not really sure who to ask.

543
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:22,457
Except Bill and Stacy, but he's
Kyle's friend from work, so I can't ask him.

544
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,293
I think it'd be a lot easier for her
back there in Seattle, you know?

545
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,577
Well, what about the mediators?
Maybe they can recommend somebody.

546
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,049
Yeah, I asked them,
but they're supposed to be impartial

547
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,371
- so they can't recommend anyone.
- Oh.

548
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,738
<i>I don't know. I guess maybe I'll try and
find someone out of the Yellow Pages.</i>

549
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,053
Dahlia, you can't pick some
random lawyer out of a phone book.

550
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,608
I can't believe it.
Those kids are up there again.

551
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,338
What?

552
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,172
Mary, I'm gonna have
to call you back later, OK?

553
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,569
I have to go downstairs
and deal with this.

554
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,378
- All right. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
- Bye.

555
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,338
Stop it. She'll catch you.

556
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,218
No, I'm not allowed to go to the roof.

557
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,612
Cos it's dangerous,
and by the ways, it's spooky at night.

558
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,777
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody.

559
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,777
Is it your friend Nobody again?

560
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,895
Do you have an invisible friend
only you can see?

561
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,690
Is it a boy or a girl?

562
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,736
Girl.

563
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,813
- How old is she?
- My age. Almost exactly.

564
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,813
She was born a month before me.
So she's older.

565
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,892
Wow. What's her name?

566
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,177
- Natasha.
- Natasha?

567
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,615
That's a really interesting name.
Where'd you get that name from?

568
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,770
It's just her name.

569
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,896
Night, Mom.

570
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,814
I can't go up to 10F now. If I leave my post
and Mr. Murray finds out, I'm dead.

571
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,256
OK, but if they leave the water running
then my bedroom ceiling could collapse.

572
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,251
- Understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

573
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,137
But what you gotta understand
is if I leave now

574
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,575
I might as well go straight to
Unemployment. That's not gonna happen.

575
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,891
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know if
you want me to call the cops or something.

576
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,211
- Just give me a second. Hang on.
- It's all right, never mind.

577
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,451
I'll deal with it. And thanks for your help.

578
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,371
All right.

579
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,579
Mommy, come.

580
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,534
Are you OK?

581
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,895
Can I help you?

582
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,497
I told you. I told you to leave me alone.

583
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,974
Mom?

584
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,848
- Get away from me, you little bitch.
- Mommy?

585
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,091
- I hate you.
- Let me help you.

586
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,694
I hate you.

587
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,932
- Do you hear me? I hate you.
- No.

588
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,255
Just go! Go!

589
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,016
Mommy.

590
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,328
Wh...

591
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,695
- What?
- You're scaring me.

592
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,376
- What's wrong?
- You were having a bad dream again.

593
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,735
Again?

594
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,493
You always make that sound
when you sleep.

595
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,093
I do?

596
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,136
Ever since Daddy left.

597
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,336
- Stop doing that, OK?
- OK.

598
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,891
- It scares me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

599
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,050
It's OK.

600
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,130
There's nothing to be scared of.

601
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,934
- Have a good day. See you later.
- OK. Bye, Mommy.

602
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,055
Yeah, he was a frat brother
of Joe's at Wash U.

603
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,778
Joe says he's as smart as a whip.

604
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,135
If he was at college with Joe
I guess he's been practicing for a while.

605
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,575
Well, actually, he got a late start
on being a lawyer.

606
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,890
- He lost a decade to partying.
- A decade?

607
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,811
No, seriously, Joe says he's really good

608
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,652
and he won't charge you
an arm and a leg.

609
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,049
- His name is Platzer.
- OK.

610
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,176
- P-L-A...
- Right.

611
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,739
...T-Z-E-R.

612
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:29,093
Come on, Platz.
This mess was sloppy, unprofessional.

613
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,695
I mean, I know I get caught,
but my work? My craft?

614
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,374
My craft ain't sloppy.

615
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,291
That much is true.

616
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,018
- Thank you.
- Hello?

617
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,091
Mr. Platzer, hi.
My name is Dahlia Williams.

618
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,411
Hi, Mrs. Williams.
John told me you'd be calling.

619
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,379
I can't meet till next week, so you give me
opposing counsel's name and number

620
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,054
and I'll give him a call
and get up to speed on their issues.

621
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,700
Sure. My husband's lawyer's name
is Carrie Simmons.

622
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,011
That's OK, I know Carrie's number.
This is not gonna be so easy.

623
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,217
We should meet Monday. Where do you
work? I'll come by in your lunch hour.

624
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,657
It's Sutton Place Radiology.
585 East 58th Street.

625
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,937
You're being very nice,
but I'm sorry, I just have to ask.

626
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,932
- How much is that gonna cost me?
- We'll figure the money out.

627
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,978
I'll call Carrie, get up to speed,
then we'll go over everything Monday,

628
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,132
- including my fee, OK?
- OK. Thanks so much.

629
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,450
- OK. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

630
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:23,374
Figure the money out? That's some
sweet thing you're figuring money for.

631
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:28,136
- You gonna figure my money too?
- You're lucky I don't charge you double.

632
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:31,018
OK, so everyone looking at me.
And do you all have a piece of tape?

633
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,455
Show me, show me. Put it somewhere silly.

634
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,338
Somewhere silly. Your forehead,
your nose. Make a beard. OK.

635
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,456
Now put it on the back of your picture

636
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,134
and then you're gonna follow me into the
hallway cos we're gonna put them up.

637
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:46,692
Ten, nine, eight, a-seven, a-six,
five, four, three, two, one.

638
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,340
Beautiful.

639
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,376
- Anyone else need tape?
- I do.

640
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,018
If it's not sticking...

641
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,136
- Mom, you're early.
- I know.

642
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,450
The subway was so much faster
than the Tram.

643
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,849
I was at work ten minutes ago.
Isn't that amazing?

644
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,728
- I think we picked the perfect place to live.
- Daddy doesn't like it here.

645
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,732
He wants me to move with him
to that other city.

646
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:07,855
Oh.

647
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,498
- When did Daddy say that?
- Today.

648
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,255
He came to see
what my new school was like.

649
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,295
Hm.

650
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,575
- I gotta go.
- OK. I'll be waiting for you.

651
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,810
OK.

652
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,375
Yeah, he came by to give us his cell phone
number in case of an emergency.

653
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:29,012
He was with Cecilia for a few minutes.
He said hi, he looked at the room.

654
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,660
Is there some problem?
Is he not allowed to?

655
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,651
Is there some restraining order
against him?

656
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,016
No. No.

657
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,490
I was just... wondering if Ceci was...

658
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,969
Still imagining things?

659
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:48,258
Actually, I'm glad you brought that up.
Her imaginary friend hasn't gone away.

660
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,696
In fact, she threw somewhat of a tantrum
during circle time

661
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,930
when we wouldn't let her "friend"
sing along.

662
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,454
I had to have her take a time-out.

663
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:01,534
I'm sorry. I'll certainly
talk to Ceci about that.

664
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,578
You know, the PTA provides
a psychologist, Katie Shoettle.

665
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,653
She's very nice. She comes every
Wednesday. It's absolutely no charge.

666
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,779
I'll talk to Ceci about it. It'll stop.
I'm really sorry about that.

667
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,573
You'll see. Couple of days, blend right in.

668
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,015
You won't see the difference.

669
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,852
I'm sure you're right. Thank you.

670
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,776
You know, those kids were up there
again last night, running around,

671
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,499
and I could hear them running water. So...

672
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,979
You know what I'm gonna do?

673
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,609
I'm gonna speak with Murray
about changing the lock on 10F.

674
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,533
You know what he told me?
Rimsky paid no rent this month.

675
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,975
- He's probably not coming back anyway.
- OK.

676
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,494
Well, that would be great
if you could change the lock.

677
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,969
Starting to have nightmares
about what's going on up there.

678
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,530
- Really? You gotta relax, huh?
- Can I get you something before you go?

679
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,532
Yeah. Get me a reward
for all this hard work I've been doing.

680
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,054
Yeah? I think I have beer.

681
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,370
- You want a beer?
- I don't drink beer.

682
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,530
Coffee? I could make a pot of coffee
if you want.

683
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,976
Oh, forget it. I've been working hard today.
I'm tired. I'm going.

684
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,254
OK. Well, thank you.

685
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,570
What about Hello Kitty? Can I have it now?

686
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,652
Oh, so sorry, kid.
Somebody came by for it today.

687
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,493
They were visiting town,
left it there by accident.

688
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:16,050
Oh, that little girl,
she was so happy to have it back.

689
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,132
- You're lying.
- Ceci.

690
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,814
He's lying, Mommy. Nobody came.

691
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,130
You want to teach that goddamn brat
some manners, lady.

692
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,529
Sorry.

693
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,370
What is the matter with you?

694
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,336
Mm.

695
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,174
Mac and cheese. My favorite.
I love you, Mommy.

696
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,535
I love you too, sweetheart.
I love you very much.

697
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,373
But, you know, it was very wrong of you
to call Mr. Veeck a liar.

698
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:42,089
- You know that, don't you?
- He is a liar.

699
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,331
Ceci. You don't know that he's a liar.

700
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,729
- Yes, I do.
- How? How do you know that?

701
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:52,655
Natasha told me he still had
the Hello Kitty backpack in his desk.

702
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,095
I want to talk to you
about your imaginary friend, OK?

703
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,729
- She's not imaginary.
- She's not?

704
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:03,177
She's lost. Her mommy forgot about her
and now she's lost.

705
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,449
Like you.

706
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:12,251
- What are you talking about?
- Your mommy forgot about you, right?

707
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,256
Did someone tell you that?

708
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,939
- You did.
- No.

709
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,171
I didn't tell you that, Ceci.

710
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,979
Who told you that?

711
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,856
Are you gonna answer me?
I'm asking you a question.

712
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,215
- Who told you?
- Natasha told me.

713
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,656
Stop it. You stop lying to me.

714
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,856
Who told you?

715
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,212
Who told you?

716
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,768
Who told you?

717
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,815
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm just calling to arrange...

718
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,735
What are you trying to do? Sneaking into
her school, telling her it isn't any good?

719
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,937
Talking to her about my mother?
How dare you talk to her about my mother.

720
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,615
Look, I don't know who or what pressed
your wacko button today, and I don't care,

721
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,294
I'm calling to tell you I'm picking up Ceci
Saturday at nine.

722
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,895
I'll bring her back Sunday at six.
Don't play any games.

723
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,175
Have her there, 9am sharp.

724
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,328
- I tell you punks. No skating in here.
- Yeah, yeah.

725
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,653
She's cute.

726
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,530
Daddy's here!

727
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,576
Hey!

728
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,537
Look at you.

729
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,771
You shouldn't be smoking, Daddy.

730
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,896
I'm gonna quit real soon, honey. I promise.

731
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:07,371
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Satisfied?

732
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:10,452
As far as I'm concerned,
you can smoke as much as you like, Kyle.

733
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,417
Honey.

734
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,014
- I'll bring her back tomorrow at six.
- OK.

735
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,489
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, honey.

736
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,739
Hey, pretty lady. What's happening?

737
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,493
Laundry. Excuse me.

738
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:00,936
I got some dirty things I'd like you to clean.

739
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,090
Sorry.

740
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,575
I forgot my smokes.

741
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:08,610
Help!

742
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:15,618
Smart-ass kids.
Steve and Billy. They did this.

743
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,818
You'll see. Monday, the plumbers come.
They'll find something stuck in there.

744
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,050
They gum 'em up. Brats.

745
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,295
- Who's Natasha?
- What?

746
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,408
Who's Natasha Rimsky?

747
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,810
Little girl. 10F.

748
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,336
- Where is she now?
- How do I know? With her mother, I guess.

749
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,888
Couldn't stand living
with that crazy Russian husband of hers.

750
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:43,098
Took the little girl with her.
That Russki, he was a piece of work.

751
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,652
<i>Always "blyad".</i>

752
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,208
Look, there's a Laundromat
down the block.

753
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,976
I'll get you some garbage bags
so you don't get wet carrying them there.

754
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:04,052
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider
climbed up the water spout</i>

755
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,856
Hi, Mommy.

756
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,257
Glad you like spaghetti and meatballs.

757
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,889
- It's my favorite.
- Your favorite?

758
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,653
I love them, Mommy.

759
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,935
I'm glad.

760
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,817
Mm.

761
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,969
I love you, Mommy.

762
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,449
You haven't said anything
about what your dad's new place is like.

763
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,575
- I don't like it.
- Really?

764
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,695
Yeah.

765
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,657
Well, maybe it's just new
and you need to get used to it.

766
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,890
But I don't wanna get used to it.

767
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:10,849
I don't wanna stay with Daddy.
I only wanna stay with you.

768
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:16,409
Well, your dad loves you. He'll be happy
that you spent this time with him.

769
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:22,097
<i>Itsy-bitsy spider

770
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,489
<i>Down came the rain</i>

771
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:28,209
- Honey, can you stop singing that?
- Why? It happened.

772
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,894
I want to go to bed now, Mommy. I'm tired.

773
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,370
- Mommy?
- Mm?

774
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:46,816
I'm scared, Mommy.
I want to sleep with you.

775
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,936
Yeah.

776
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:06,372
I love you, Mommy.
Thank you for taking care of me.

777
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:34,771
Ceci?

778
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,337
- Hello?
- Mommy, where were you?

779
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:51,095
- I was napping.
- No, not now. Last night.

780
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:56,095
Where were you last night? I called
two times for you to say goodnight to me.

781
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,694
- Where were you?
- Last night?

782
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:03,774
OK, Daddy. Daddy says he's bringing
me home a half an hour early.

783
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:06,249
OK, Daddy. 5:30.

784
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,808
He says to be there in the lobby at 5:30.

785
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,970
- Don't fall asleep again, Mommy.
- OK.

786
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:13,654
I gotta go. I'm getting chocolate cake.

787
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,332
- Bye.
- Bye.

788
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,930
Dahlia, where have you been?
I left two messages.

789
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,329
I lost a day, Mary.

790
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:25,369
I took a pill, just one pill,
and it knocked me out for 24 hours.

791
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,212
That's never happened before.

792
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:32,579
And I'm tired, really tired.
It's like I haven't slept at all.

793
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:36,539
Dahlia, are you OK? Are you really OK?

794
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:40,056
My headache's gone. But the leak is back.

795
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:44,179
It's back?
I thought they were gonna fix that thing.

796
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,415
- Dahlia?
- Yeah?

797
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,732
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

798
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,611
You have five new messages.
First new message.

799
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,737
Long nap, huh? Call me.

800
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,050
Message erased.
Next message.

801
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:04,610
Hi, Jeff Platzer here. I got the preliminaries
from your husband's lawyer

802
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,851
and I need to touch base with you about
his accusations as soon as possible.

803
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:11,216
Believe it or not I'm actually available
on Sunday afternoon until five.

804
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,610
If you are, would you call my cell?
OK. Bye.

805
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,691
- Mrs. Williams?
- Yeah.

806
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:28,248
Hi. I'm your lawyer.

807
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,649
- Hi.
- Hi.

808
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,850
- I'm sorry it's such a mess.
- No, it's OK.

809
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,216
I just moved into a new office
and they've painted it.

810
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,768
I can't stand the smell so I'm improvising.

811
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,896
OK.

812
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,576
- Hi.
- Hi.

813
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,970
- So...
- OK.

814
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:58,371
Your husband's claiming
you're mentally unstable

815
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,894
because your father
was physically abusive

816
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:04,495
and your mother was an alcoholic
who abandoned you.

817
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:06,571
That's...

818
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,615
unbelievable.

819
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:14,659
- What do my parents have to do with this?
- That's my question exactly.

820
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:19,336
What's more relevant is that your husband
says you suffer from crippling migraines

821
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,536
and paranoid delusions.

822
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,939
He says he'll submit school reports

823
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:26,456
that show your daughter
is beginning to share your fantasy life.

824
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,019
"Cecilia is now having trouble

825
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,375
distinguishing between
what is real and what is not. "

826
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,337
It's a lie. It's a lie.

827
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,218
In child custody briefs, it's standard
to make these kinds of accusations.

828
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,653
Don't take it too seriously.

829
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:40,574
But I do need to know what, if anything,
in your husband's narrative

830
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:45,859
has some semblance, some shred of fact
that he might produce in court.

831
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:50,138
Well, I get migraines.
Yeah. That's true.

832
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:54,293
But they've never interfered
with my ability to do anything.

833
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:59,659
You can talk to my doctor about that. He'll
tell you they've certainly never crippled me.

834
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,173
Um...

835
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:06,129
As for Ceci, I think
she's a little bit lonely right now.

836
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:09,292
Her father's abandoned her and she was
forced to move from her neighborhood.

837
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,689
So...

838
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:16,217
she's developed an imaginary friend.
But that's normal.

839
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:22,735
That's fine. But for future reference, when
you're talking to, for example, a judge,

840
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,414
I would stay away from phrases like,
"her father's abandoned her".

841
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,412
It's important, when the other side
is being so melodramatic,

842
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,810
- to sound like we're the sane ones.
- Right.

843
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,414
- That's all I'm saying.
- OK.

844
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,808
- I'd like to notch that.
- Oh, yeah, man.

845
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,216
Hey, sweetheart.

846
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,210
- Mommy?
- Yeah.

847
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,656
- Look what Daddy gave me.
- Wow.

848
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:17,495
- That's great, You're so lucky.
- Listen, next Saturday's a problem.

849
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,491
Can we do Sunday and I'll bring her
first thing in the morning

850
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,775
for school on Monday?

851
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:24,658
Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.

852
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:29,655
- Come on, honey. Say bye to Daddy.
- Bye, Daddy. Thanks for the Barbie.

853
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,379
- Did you do that ponytail by yourself?
- Yeah.

854
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,815
- It's a good one.
- Thanks.

855
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,494
- I like the collar.
- Thanks.

856
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,574
Honey, you know what,
I forgot to do something.

857
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:51,776
I'm gonna be right back.
Will you wait right here for me?

858
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,896
- Don't go anywhere, OK?
- OK.

859
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,969
Be right back.

860
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:58,609
Two... one.

861
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,011
Ceci?

862
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,858
Ceci? Stay in the elevator.
I'm bringing you down.

863
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,650
Ceci, can you hear me?

864
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:53,330
Bake me a cake as fast as you can.
Roll it, pat it and mark it with a B.

865
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:56,935
- No more pretending to play with Natasha.
- She won't let me.

866
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:00,456
Well, then you stop talking to her.
You tell her I said so.

867
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,577
You tell her your mommy said
you can't play with her any more.

868
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,855
OK, Mommy.

869
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,532
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Platzer.

870
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:15,612
I'm sorry to call you late,
but I think my husband...

871
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,611
Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night.
I can't talk.

872
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,579
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I just need
to tell you this as soon as possible.

873
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,696
I think my husband
is trying to drive me crazy.

874
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,657
Either that or he's hoping
that I'm gonna act crazy.

875
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:29,335
- Hang on. Let me call you right back.
- OK.

876
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,130
You say neither of the Rimskys
are living there?

877
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,450
No, no one's there.
So Kyle's paying these kids.

878
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:37,132
I mean, he must be paying these kids

879
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,973
to mess around with the water
and the backpack. And the elevator.

880
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:43,416
I went into the elevator the other day
and the buttons were burned off.

881
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,492
Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night
and I'm at the movies with my family.

882
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:50,334
If I don't want to be handling
my own divorce, I gotta get back. So...

883
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,570
I'll call you tomorrow
and we'll sort this out. All right?

884
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,013
Yeah. Absolutely.

885
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,809
Get down!

886
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:28,172
This time make sure
you put it in the garbage truck.

887
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,296
- Where did you...
- Those kids have been playing games,

888
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,893
moving it around the building.

889
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:36,053
And they were upstairs again so now
there's water all over my bedroom floor.

890
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,131
- They're running the water again?
- Mm-hm.

891
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,176
I thought you were gonna
change the lock on 10F.

892
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:43,616
Murray didn't authorize it.
He has to send me a 112B form.

893
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:47,249
- Look, is the plumber here yet?
- No, no. It's only 8:15.

894
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:51,697
OK, look. I left a message for Mr. Murray.
I told him I need my problem fixed first.

895
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,340
So when the plumber gets here,
send him up to my apartment

896
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:58,299
or you and Murray
can both talk to my lawyer. OK?

897
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,849
Do you remember
what we talked about last night?

898
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:16,977
- Yes, Mommy.
- OK.

899
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,492
See you later, OK?

900
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,531
- Hello.
- Hi. Jeff Platzer here.

901
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:27,612
- Hi, Mr. Platzer.
- Listen, I did a little homework on Rimsky

902
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,373
and I think I turned up the missing mother
in a hospital in San Diego.

903
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,575
Why are you looking for her?

904
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:35,130
I figured the Rimskys might want to know
their apartment's being used by strangers.

905
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:38,098
Mrs. Williams, we're never gonna prove
your husband's behind this harassment.

906
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:42,139
And trying to do that is just playing
his game. He wants you to look paranoid.

907
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:44,256
We gotta deal with this straight,
as if it's all on the level.

908
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,535
So that's what we'll do,
we'll play it straight.

909
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:49,009
I'm due in court, I'll call you
when I get ahold of Mrs. Rimsky.

910
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,773
In the meantime, just sit tight.

911
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,294
- I will. Thanks so much.
- OK.

912
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,530
- Bye.
- Bye.

913
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:00,056
- Abigail's making a storm, sweetheart.
- Done!

914
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,132
Done? You remember you have
to sign your name so you know whose it is.

915
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:07,293
You don't want me to take that home
and say I did it, do you?

916
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:10,178
I like that. Pirates?

917
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,056
Stop it.

918
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,535
Stop it, I told you, leave me alone.

919
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,770
- We've got rainbows...
- Stop it!

920
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:22,769
Stop it!

921
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:25,056
Stop it!

922
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,256
Stop it!

923
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:33,772
You're gonna get cleaned up
and when you're done

924
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:37,739
you're gonna come back and sit with me
and we'll read a story together.

925
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,971
Then maybe we'll talk about your friend.

926
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,014
Go on.

927
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:15,008
Ceci!

928
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,214
Go away!

929
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,210
- Where is she?
- She passed out in the bathroom.

930
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,609
We don't know what happened.
There was water all over the place.

931
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,213
- We took her to the hospital.
- Hospital?

932
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:51,609
We just wanted to check her out.
It's school policy. We couldn't reach you.

933
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,692
I had an emergency at work,
I didn't get my messages for two hours.

934
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,975
We called her father
and he's gonna meet her at the hospital.

935
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:00,496
- OK. Which hospital?
- It's the one right here on the island.

936
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:03,174
Kyle took her.
They released her and he took her.

937
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:06,570
- Did they say what was wrong?
- They said, you know, it's nothing serious.

938
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:08,252
She fainted but...

939
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:13,050
I'm trying to find him. I called his home
number, I called his cell phone number,

940
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,529
I called his office number,
and he's avoiding me

941
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:18,214
so I need to know what to do.
Can I go to his apartment?

942
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,053
Mrs. Williams, I need you to calm down.
I need it, your daughter needs it.

943
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,334
Just calm down, OK?

944
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,570
I'm sorry. I know you don't know me,
but you have to believe me.

945
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,730
I'm not crazy, I'm really not.

946
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,492
- I believe you, Mrs. Williams.
- I'm really not.

947
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:32,334
Just go home. Your husband and your
daughter are probably waiting for you.

948
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:35,492
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

949
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,298
Ceci.

950
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,456
Ceci.

951
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:48,290
- No new messages.
- Oh, God.

952
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:52,657
- Hello?
- Hello? It's Jeff. Are they there?

953
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,729
- No.
- They're not there?

954
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:57,699
No. There's no message.

955
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,010
There's water everywhere.

956
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:04,013
Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Williams, calm down.
Calm down.

957
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,409
- She can't be here.
- What do you want me to do?

958
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,411
Oh, God.

959
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:12,413
I can't be her mother,
I don't know how to be myself.

960
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:15,251
Ceci!

961
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:26,574
I hate you.
Get away from me, you little bitch.

962
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:28,730
I hate you.

963
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:29,809
Fuck!

964
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:33,210
I hate you! I hate you!

965
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,256
Bitch!

966
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,410
Sorry about this. I really had no idea.

967
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,809
I would've come down myself
a long time ago.

968
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,412
Better open it.

969
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,690
Hello?

970
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,930
Hello?

971
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,570
Jesus.

972
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:25,655
Look at this. This is appalling.
This is appalling.

973
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:29,779
The plumber's on his way. I'm paying him
double overtime so he can get here tonight.

974
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,896
Hello?

975
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,653
- I'll get some of these lights on.
- Mrs. Williams?

976
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:41,817
- You OK?
- I'm awake.

977
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,209
The plumber will be here in 15 minutes.

978
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,973
- Mr. Murray?
- This is just a big misunderstanding. OK?

979
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:51,018
Mr. Veeck did not keep me informed.
This will be fixed tonight.

980
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:54,490
- Or she's staying at the Plaza, right?
- It will definitely be fixed tonight.

981
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:57,299
- And I want to talk to Veeck.
- I will get him.

982
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,251
You OK?

983
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:06,855
- Migraine, huh?
- Yeah.

984
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:13,617
- I'll keep my voice low.
- Thanks.

985
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,294
I spoke with your husband's lawyer
and Ceci's fine.

986
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,610
Kyle will bring her to school in the morning.

987
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,258
OK.

988
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,218
Now, this part is gonna piss you off.

989
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,053
They want Ceci to see a psychologist
to be evaluated.

990
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:31,658
There's nothing we can do about that
but say yes. So we're saying yes.

991
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:34,015
OK.

992
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:38,340
- Here we are.
- Mr. Veeck.

993
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,411
I had an interesting conversation
with Mrs. Rimsky today.

994
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,298
She was very surprised to hear
her daughter isn't living upstairs.

995
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,894
- In 10F?
- Mm-hm.

996
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,778
- You said they left together.
- That's what the Russian said.

997
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:51,738
No, she left without her daughter.
She didn't think she could take care of her.

998
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,175
Mrs. Rimsky's an alcoholic.
She claimed she was going for treatment,

999
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,820
and had to leave the girl behind
with the father.

1000
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,016
You knew that, didn't you?

1001
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:02,418
Only Mr. Rimsky didn't take Natasha
with him.

1002
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,297
I spoke with Grandma Rimsky
in Moscow today

1003
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,769
and she said her son
is living with her alone.

1004
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:10,614
- So he lied to me. What do I know?
- You had to know.

1005
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:15,137
Well, we'll find out tomorrow. I have
a phone appointment with Mr. Rimsky.

1006
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:19,372
- Why did you lie about the little girl?
- I didn't want to get involved, that's all.

1007
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:22,258
Did you see Natasha after her mother left?

1008
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,729
It's a simple question, Veeck.

1009
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:32,450
Yeah. I see her. I see her that afternoon.
I see her playing on the stairs.

1010
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:37,136
Then the next day the father tells me she
leave with the mother. I ask no questions.

1011
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:40,337
- Well, if he killed her, it's not my business.
- "Killed her"?

1012
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,888
"If he killed her"?

1013
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,132
Plumber!

1014
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:49,690
You got a lot more than a leak to fix,
Mr. Murray.

1015
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,691
Mr. Veeck.

1016
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:58,619
- If you could just...
- Come on in, just right inside.

1017
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,816
Thank you.

1018
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,850
Some kind of pipe or something.

1019
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:07,376
Yeah, well, see, that is a brand-new pipe.
So, this will all be patched tomorrow.

1020
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:10,133
- By professionals.
- By professionals. Good as new.

1021
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:14,930
It better be. I'm calling NYPD
to report a child is missing.

1022
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:19,059
OK. I mean, I'm sure there's
a simple explanation for that, but...

1023
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:24,294
So, goodnight.
And, again, I am so sorry about all this.

1024
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,136
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1025
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:31,978
- You gonna be OK?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

1026
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:37,491
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm feeling much better, actually.

1027
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:40,458
- I gotta go. Family.
- OK. Mm.

1028
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:45,259
I'll keep my cell on all night
and if you need me just call.

1029
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,490
- Any hour.
- Thanks.

1030
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,974
- Thanks again. Bye.
- OK. Bye.

1031
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,260
She left you behind.

1032
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:09,578
They both left you behind.

1033
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:11,735
Help me.

1034
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:46,571
Wait!

1035
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:25,618
I told Murray, I told him a million times.

1036
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:29,056
It's not my job. I'm not a goddamn plumber.

1037
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:39,376
How you feeling? You OK?

1038
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:41,530
- You warmed up?
- I'm OK.

1039
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:46,091
Cops think Veeck probably
left the tank open and somehow she fell in.

1040
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:49,013
They even think he might have discovered
she'd fallen in weeks ago.

1041
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,898
That's why he hadn't cleaned it in so long.

1042
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:54,255
They might have enough to charge him
with criminal negligence.

1043
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:59,368
They'd arrest the parents, but they're out
of state and there are no witnesses, so...

1044
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:03,976
The truth is, they'll probably
never know what happened.

1045
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:07,580
Her mother left her.

1046
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:11,658
The father assumed
that she was with her mom,

1047
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:16,454
and the mother assumed
she was with her father.

1048
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,968
Guess everyone just assumed.

1049
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:25,733
No one really cared what happened to her.

1050
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:28,653
That's what it looks like.

1051
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,411
I'll tell Mary you've been a prince.

1052
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,411
You just accomplished the impossible,
Mrs. Williams.

1053
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,015
You actually made me glad
I went to law school.

1054
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,089
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

1055
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:51,051
I can probably get you
a year's free rent out of Murray.

1056
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:53,893
Oh! No, it's OK.

1057
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:56,016
I'm moving.

1058
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:59,251
- Call me in the morning, OK?
- Yeah.

1059
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,656
- Come on, princess.
- Bye, Daddy.

1060
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,935
Bye.

1061
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,933
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

1062
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:32,170
Yeah?

1063
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:40,500
OK. I'll be here after school to pick you up.
See you after school.

1064
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,495
- Hey.
- Hi.

1065
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,729
Thank you for taking care
of Ceci yesterday.

1066
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:54,779
It's OK. I'm really worried
about her mental state.

1067
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:57,169
- I am too.
- You are?

1068
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,057
Yeah.

1069
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:02,450
So, I've been thinking...

1070
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:05,498
I don't want her
to have to choose between us.

1071
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:09,095
- What do you mean?
- I want to look for a place in Jersey City

1072
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:12,138
so that shared custody
will be easier for both of us.

1073
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:15,610
And we can do, you know,
one week with me, and one week with you.

1074
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,658
Or maybe split the week.
We can see what works best.

1075
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:23,817
- You serious?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1076
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:28,337
Hey, you know, you were right about the
school here. I checked it out. It's good.

1077
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,412
- Maybe I could get a place...
- No, it's fine.

1078
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:35,778
After this, we'll get a...
a place in Jersey City.

1079
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,610
I'll see you later.

1080
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:53,892
- When are we moving?
- Not until next week, sweetheart.

1081
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:58,496
This is winter stuff though
so we can pack it up now.

1082
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:01,538
You OK? Are you feeling OK?

1083
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:16,409
What are you thinking about?

1084
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,572
Why did her mommy forget about her?

1085
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:33,088
Do you know how much I love you?

1086
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:38,738
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

1087
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:42,608
- Do you know I would do anything for you?
- Yes.

1088
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:46,049
That's a promise.

1089
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:49,894
- Honey, do you want bubbles tonight?
- Uh-huh.

1090
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:54,934
There you are.

1091
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:59,810
- That's so great, Dahlia.
- Well, I think it's gonna be for the best.

1092
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:03,097
And moving out of here,
that is definitely for the best.

1093
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:06,968
What do you want to do? Be a chef? OK.

1094
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:10,132
Let's see if we can make you a chef hat.

1095
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:14,892
There.

1096
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:17,653
Now, what are you going to cook?

1097
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,812
Mac and cheese?

1098
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,051
Look, I should go get Ceci out of the tub
before she turns into a prune.

1099
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:26,415
- She's so cute.
- So... Oh!

1100
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:29,617
Here she is now.
Yeah. So I will talk to you tomorrow.

1101
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,099
- OK. Take care. Bye.
- OK. You too.

1102
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,374
Goodnight.

1103
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:36,738
- Mommy, can you read me a story?
- Course I can, honey.

1104
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:44,259
Let's see which one you picked.

1105
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:59,330
We haven't read this one
in a long time, have we?

1106
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:06,379
"There were once a man and a woman
who had long in vain wished for a child. "

1107
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,179
We need more snow, don't you think?

1108
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,574
Then let's get some more snow.

1109
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:19,978
...beautiful Rapunzel.

1110
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:35,695
Don't leave me.
I want you to be my mommy.

1111
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:38,248
- Don't leave me.
- Ceci!

1112
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,774
You can't leave me.

1113
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,331
Ceci!

1114
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,456
Ceci!

1115
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,178
Ceci!

1116
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:51,137
Ceci!

1117
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:55,856
Ceci!

1118
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:58,978
No!

1119
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:02,217
Ceci!

1120
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:10,250
Ceci!

1121
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,535
Ceci!

1122
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:14,731
Oh, God.

1123
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:18,017
Let her go! You let her go!

1124
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,812
No!

1125
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,775
No! Please!

1126
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:45,409
Natasha! Let her go! Please.

1127
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:49,133
We'll stay. We'll stay here with you.

1128
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,813
What do you want?

1129
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:57,488
I'll be your mother.

1130
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,730
- Please.
- Forever?

1131
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,649
Forever.

1132
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:06,810
Forever. Yes.

1133
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:10,051
I'll be your mother forever.

1134
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:13,018
Take me. Please, take me.

1135
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:19,335
Yeah, OK. So we got an 11-46,
Caucasian female, aged 30,

1136
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:22,696
no apparent cause of death,
and a six-year-old girl with shock.

1137
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:24,736
Trying to locate the father.

1138
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:38,456
Ceci.

1139
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:20,137
Let's go home, honey.
Would you get the door?

1140
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:03,489
We did a whole bunch of them.
A whole neighborhood.

1141
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:06,014
What was this one about?
Do you remember?

1142
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,058
That was me and then that was you.

1143
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:12,450
- That was a tree.
- A tree.

1144
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:18,297
- And then that's a little angel.
- Beautiful gold wings on the angel.

1145
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,411
Come on.

1146
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:46,974
OK, honey, let's walk.

1147
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:51,814
What's wrong with you?

1148
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:58,096
Come on.

1149
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:03,449
Ceci.

1150
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,093
Ceci?

1151
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:06,250
Ceci?

1152
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:08,570
Open the door.
Push the button, Ceci.

1153
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:11,413
Open it. Open the door. Ceci!

1154
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:41,695
My beautiful girl.

1155
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:55,288
Whenever you need me, I'm here.

1156
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:01,379
OK, Daddy. Let's go.
