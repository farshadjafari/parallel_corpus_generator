1
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:11,560
TETE AND THE MOON

2
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:53,229
Don't worry, it won't collapse.

3
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:57,200
Tete, you have to climb
upwards, damn it!

4
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,267
Don't freeze!

5
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:02,028
You're doing just fine,
climb with both balls!

6
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:04,999
<i>My name is Tete</i>
<i>and I'm a ''crown''...</i>

7
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:07,659
<i>which means</i>
<i>I'm the little boy who climbs...</i>

8
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:10,826
<i>to the very top of the pyramids</i>
<i>we make in my country.</i>

9
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:13,526
<i>It frightens me</i>
<i>because sometimes we fall.</i>

10
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:16,623
<i>And people get hurt.</i>

11
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:50,361
<i>Jordi is one of my friends.</i>

12
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:54,368
<i>We call him Stallone</i>
<i>because he's the strongest of them all.</i>

13
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,196
<i>He really loves walnuts</i>
<i>and motorcycles.</i>

14
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,928
<i>He just bought</i>
<i>a Kawasaki 750.</i>

15
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,900
<i>This is Miguel,</i>
<i>he's also Catalan...</i>

16
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,830
<i>but his parents</i>
<i>are from the south...</i>

17
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:10,492
<i>his father jokingly says</i>
<i>he's a foreigner...</i>

18
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,262
<i>like me because my mother</i>
<i>is from Andalusia.</i>

19
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,500
<i>Vanesa has breasts firm as rocks...</i>

20
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,126
<i>she's Stallone's girlfriend</i>
<i>and every time I climb by her...</i>

21
00:03:35,232 --> 00:03:37,723
<i>I touch her breasts</i>
<i>as much as I can.</i>

22
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:51,093
Oome on, Tete,
with both balls, get up there!

23
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,598
Don't look down, eh?

24
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:57,602
Don't freeze!
Keep climbing!

25
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:00,497
Don't freeze, don't look down!
Damn, keep climbing!

26
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:07,857
<i>Sometimes I don't dare</i>
<i>climb back down...</i>

27
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:10,433
<i>'cause my father's there</i>
<i>and he's like an animal.</i>

28
00:04:10,532 --> 00:04:13,695
<i>I don't know which is worse,</i>
<i>falling or dealing with his anger.</i>

29
00:04:13,798 --> 00:04:16,426
<i>He always talks</i>
<i>about balls and Catalonia...</i>

30
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:19,797
<i>and honor</i>
<i>and all that stuff.</i>

31
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:23,390
Oome on, with balls,
we're almost there!

32
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:25,433
Don't freeze, don't freeze!

33
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,363
Keep climbing,
you're almost there!

34
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:56,769
<i>I was about to have a brother,</i>
<i>I didn't like it one bit.</i>

35
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:47,225
<i>The other problem I had</i>
<i>was my rival.</i>

36
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:51,063
<i>Everyone said he was a better</i>
<i>''crown'' than me.</i>

37
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:53,497
<i>That he climbed faster than me.</i>

38
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,090
<i>He always beat me.</i>

39
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,793
You have to do it better, Tete.

40
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:10,889
Think positive.

41
00:06:18,832 --> 00:06:20,493
<i>What really made me angry...</i>

42
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,726
<i>was to see</i>
<i>how they tossed him in the air...</i>

43
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:26,029
<i>it was like floating in the air,</i>
<i>like an astronaut.</i>

44
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:28,032
<i>I was so jealous.</i>

45
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:43,096
- When will my little brother be born?
- Very soon.

46
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,599
And he'll be a crown, like you.

47
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,529
Like me?

48
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:50,566
I don't want a brother.

49
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:53,361
Oome on, you'll soon like it.

50
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:56,867
I'm preparing
some bread for you...

51
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:58,899
you'll lick your fingers.

52
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,559
<i>My grandfather is the only one</i>
<i>who listens to me.</i>

53
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:03,895
<i>Everyone says</i>
<i>he's a bit crazy...</i>

54
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,661
<i>but I love him very much.</i>

55
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:24,832
What's wrong?

56
00:07:24,932 --> 00:07:27,230
Tete?

57
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:30,563
Hey, you have to see
your brother.

58
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:33,566
- I don't want to.
- What do you mean by that?

59
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:34,962
Oome on!

60
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:37,962
Oome on, walk.

61
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:43,897
<i>They all looked the same</i>
<i>and just as ugly.</i>

62
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:47,025
<i>But he was the worst one.</i>
<i>He was awful.</i>

63
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:50,067
<i>Besides, they gave him a little hat...</i>

64
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,430
<i>instead of a cap</i>
<i>like grandfather's.</i>

65
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:56,797
Do you want to see your brother?
Look.

66
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:58,832
Look, that's him,
he's so handsome.

67
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:04,131
<i>He was a monster</i>
<i>and wouldn't stop crying.</i>

68
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:06,757
You're heavy.

69
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:12,692
That baby is lucky,
he'll be a crown like you.

70
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:15,631
<i>Like hell he will,</i>
<i>and if he is, he won't be like me.</i>

71
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:18,030
<i>We'll see if he has balls.</i>

72
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:21,799
Tete!

73
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:27,492
Tete!

74
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:34,225
Tete!

75
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:36,698
Oome down and help me.

76
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:37,890
I can't right now.

77
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:41,560
What do you mean you can't?
Oome down right now!

78
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:44,156
<i>They scolded me all day long.</i>

79
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:46,825
<i>All they wanted me</i>
<i>for was errands.</i>

80
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:50,060
<i>It was clear</i>
<i>that now they loved only him.</i>

81
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:51,359
<i>He was a monster.</i>

82
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:53,229
He's very ugly.

83
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,358
He's all wrinkled
like an old man.

84
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,696
What? He's so handsome.
Yes.

85
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:01,665
No, no, no.
There, there, there.

86
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:04,962
<i>I couldn't understand</i>
<i>why I had to drink cow milk...</i>

87
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:07,260
<i>and the monster</i>
<i>suckled at her breast.</i>

88
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:10,893
Be careful, Tete.

89
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,899
Leave the bottle alone.

90
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:18,032
If you feed him so much,
won't you run out of milk?

91
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:43,591
Let me see your molars.

92
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:47,634
<i>All she cared about</i>
<i>were my molars.</i>

93
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:49,962
<i>She would always</i>
<i>check my teeth.</i>

94
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:51,657
No, no, no.

95
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:55,428
Tete, go play,
I have to feed your brother.

96
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:16,963
<i>He was a pig.</i>
<i>I could have strangled him.</i>

97
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,397
<i>My mother had her breasts</i>
<i>full of milk...</i>

98
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:21,523
<i>and he was drinking it all.</i>

99
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:25,761
<i>He was emptying her,</i>
<i>he wouldn't stop sucking.</i>

100
00:10:28,332 --> 00:10:32,496
<i>I decided I'd find</i>
<i>a breast just for me.</i>

101
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:41,466
Women are full of milk.

102
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:45,467
- It's in their breasts.
- How do you know?

103
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,157
Because I do.

104
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,930
Look.

105
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:56,491
<i>They weren't bad</i>
<i>but they were too big for me.</i>

106
00:10:56,598 --> 00:11:01,035
Look at those breasts!
They really are full.

107
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:03,726
<i>They had too much milk.</i>

108
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:07,859
<i>I'll bet that the guy who filled them</i>
<i>was an animal like my father.</i>

109
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:25,628
Yes, give me your milk,
fill me with your milk.

110
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:27,927
Here it comes,
here it comes.

111
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:42,226
<i>Every night, my father</i>
<i>would fill my mother with milk.</i>

112
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:45,232
<i>She would ask for it.</i>

113
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:48,994
Fill me with your milk!
Give me your milk!

114
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:54,230
Here it comes!
Here it comes!

115
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:56,060
<i>It was all my brother's fault.</i>

116
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:59,601
<i>My father had lots of milk.</i>

117
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:10,162
<i>On the beach</i>
<i>with my grandfather...</i>

118
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:13,257
<i>we'd spend hours and hours</i>
<i>gazing at the moon.</i>

119
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,299
<i>She understood me.</i>

120
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:23,028
<i>I'll visit you some day.</i>

121
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:26,829
<i>I'll take the European flag</i>
<i>with me, you'll like it...</i>

122
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:28,627
<i>it has lots of stars...</i>

123
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:31,166
<i>and the Catalonia flag,</i>
<i>which is my country...</i>

124
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:33,562
<i>it's very small but very pretty...</i>

125
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:36,691
<i>I'll bet the American flag</i>
<i>is old and dirty.</i>

126
00:12:57,932 --> 00:13:02,426
<i>I need a breast, just for me.</i>

127
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:21,668
<i>If you can get me one,</i>
<i>send me a sign.</i>

128
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:35,733
<i>The moon helped me out</i>
<i>and sent me a star.</i>

129
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:38,266
<i>Her name was Star.</i>

130
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:40,560
I can't.

131
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:42,326
I can't.

132
00:13:48,598 --> 00:13:51,795
I love you.

133
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,423
You're the king of fire.

134
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:20,959
When someone farts,
they feel embarrassed.

135
00:14:21,065 --> 00:14:22,555
You've become
an expert at it.

136
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:29,700
Tell me you love me.

137
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:33,930
I already did.

138
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,292
<i>They were foreigners...</i>

139
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:45,060
<i>she was Portuguese</i>
<i>and he was French.</i>

140
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:48,565
<i>They had just settled down</i>
<i>in the campsite.</i>

141
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:50,929
<i>The first to meet her</i>
<i>was Miguel...</i>

142
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:54,195
<i>who said that when he touched her,</i>
<i>he felt her electricity.</i>

143
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:58,234
<i>It was a holiday at the campsite,</i>
<i>that must have been why.</i>

144
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,765
Oan you give me
a hand, please?

145
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:03,527
I can't open the faucet.

146
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:09,227
I can't, it's stuck.

147
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:17,965
What's wrong?

148
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:21,057
I don't know...

149
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:22,131
it was like a spark.

150
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:33,397
Something incredible
just happened to me.

151
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:36,365
I touched a woman
and I felt an electric charge.

152
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:38,660
You touched a woman, electricity...

153
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:41,165
wait till we're in Oalifornia
with lots of girls...

154
00:15:41,264 --> 00:15:43,357
you'll blow your circuits.

155
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:48,025
Even the walnuts
are better there.

156
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:49,996
And we'll be able to surf.

157
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:52,896
Not like the Mediterranean,
it's too calm.

158
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:55,126
Oome, I want you to see her.

159
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:57,324
Oome on.

160
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,862
Hello, good morning.

161
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:08,899
Hello.

162
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:10,864
Yeah, she looks good.

163
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:13,160
Shake hands with her
and you'll see.

164
00:16:16,898 --> 00:16:18,525
Hello.

165
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:20,861
My name is Stallone.

166
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:23,627
- My hands are wet.
- I don't mind.

167
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:28,225
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

168
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:31,789
<i>Stallone didn't get a spark.</i>

169
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:33,058
My name is M iguel.

170
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:36,224
Yes, we've already met.

171
00:16:36,331 --> 00:16:37,457
Pleased to meet you.

172
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,464
<i>But Miguel did get a spark...</i>

173
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:44,194
<i>I think that was</i>
<i>when he fell in love.</i>

174
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:48,924
We live here together,
at the Surf School.

175
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:53,900
<i>Her husband farted</i>
<i>at the Cava Park show.</i>

176
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:55,261
<i>He had a pretty bike.</i>

177
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:59,358
Wow, it's a Harley.

178
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:02,559
<i>Stallone liked it right away.</i>

179
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:07,698
It's not yours, don't touch.

180
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:19,830
<i>He was so French...</i>

181
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:22,025
<i>that as soon as he arrived</i>
<i>at the campsite...</i>

182
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:24,224
<i>he removed the French flag.</i>

183
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:27,926
<i>He didn't like to see it so dirty.</i>

184
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:29,464
<i>And he would always say...</i>

185
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:03,565
Get out of here.

186
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:46,397
<i>I had to sneak into the tent</i>
<i>to watch Star rehearse.</i>

187
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:50,491
<i>Miguel and Stallone</i>
<i>had also gone to see her.</i>

188
00:18:50,598 --> 00:18:52,566
<i>She was so lovely.</i>

189
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:37,565
<i>She showed me her breast,</i>
<i>it was so pretty.</i>

190
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:39,292
<i>It had lots of milk.</i>

191
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:45,064
<i>I never thought there could be</i>
<i>a breast as pretty as my mother's.</i>

192
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:49,789
<i>I was falling in love, too.</i>

193
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:55,733
- Do you have Perrier?
- No, only Oatalan Vichy.

194
00:19:55,831 --> 00:20:00,029
All right, I want three large bottles,
a shampoo...

195
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:04,625
<i>Miguel had followed her</i>
<i>to M rs. Maria's shop...</i>

196
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:05,892
<i>Stallone's mother.</i>

197
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:09,900
<i>And she had great custards.</i>

198
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:12,330
- What are you doing here?
- And you?

199
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:15,696
- What do you want?
- The same as you.

200
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,460
Go back to the campsite.

201
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:19,793
Where are you going?

202
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:22,627
<i>I was getting sick</i>
<i>of seeing him everywhere.</i>

203
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:26,293
<i>He had no business</i>
<i>being there.</i>

204
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:41,028
<i>All the women in the shop</i>
<i>offered me their milk and breasts.</i>

205
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:46,761
<i>Hers were the best.</i>

206
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:02,697
<i>I went in, determined</i>
<i>to ask her for her breast.</i>

207
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,662
<i>But I was too embarrassed.</i>

208
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,927
H i, Tete, cutie.
What would you like?

209
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:08,998
Thank you.

210
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:14,266
<i>I'll bet her breasts were better</i>
<i>than M rs. Maria's custards.</i>

211
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:20,494
Do you hear me?
What do you want?

212
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:22,327
- M ilk.
- Goodbye.

213
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:24,456
M ilk.

214
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:25,623
Here.

215
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:28,326
Take your milk.

216
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:30,365
- H i.
- H i.

217
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:33,923
<i>He was still waiting for her,</i>
<i>he was such a jerk.</i>

218
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:35,931
<i>I had to get rid of him.</i>

219
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:40,223
I dream of you.

220
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,993
Each time I touch you,
I feel electricity.

221
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:45,362
Well, I don't.
Leave me alone.

222
00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:48,764
Besides, I'm married.

223
00:21:48,864 --> 00:21:51,799
Wait!
Listen!

224
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:57,426
The first streak
of morning light

225
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:01,258
<i>He started to sing</i>
<i>in the middle of the street...</i>

226
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:05,233
<i>and what was worse,</i>
<i>Star liked it.</i>

227
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:09,927
<i>If she liked it,</i>
<i>then I'd learn to sing too.</i>

228
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:25,466
The first streak
of morning light

229
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:44,728
Tete, be quiet.
Go to sleep.

230
00:22:59,764 --> 00:23:01,959
What song is that?

231
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:09,460
Today, a Spaniard sang a song,
just for me.

232
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:13,296
He says that when he touches me,
he gets a spark.

233
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:18,267
- He's a boy from the Surf School.
- Which one?

234
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:21,926
- The younger one.
- It better be.

235
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:24,192
He might fall in love with you.

236
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:26,163
That's silly.

237
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:29,995
I'm probably his first love.

238
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:32,999
He's so cute.

239
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:37,159
When I touch him,
he really does get a charge.

240
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:39,391
Now you'll feel my electricity.

241
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:42,695
You'll feel my electricity!

242
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:09,603
The first streak
of morning light

243
00:24:09,697 --> 00:24:16,364
I always awaken
wondering where you are

244
00:24:16,465 --> 00:24:23,394
With my breath,
I mist up my window

245
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:34,659
I've seen you dancing.

246
00:24:37,064 --> 00:24:41,091
I've been thinking,
we could do a show together.

247
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:44,187
What are you saying?

248
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:46,163
<i>Miguel was launching</i>
<i>a full attack.</i>

249
00:24:46,264 --> 00:24:48,232
<i>He stole her panties.</i>

250
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:50,561
<i>What a pig,</i>
<i>he'd wear them on his head.</i>

251
00:24:50,664 --> 00:24:55,727
What do you mean you can't?
Take them off.

252
00:24:55,831 --> 00:24:58,322
With those panties,
you look stupid.

253
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,956
Leave me alone, damn it.
I'll do as I like.

254
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:05,398
Oatch me!

255
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:15,099
<i>If he could take her panties,</i>
<i>I'd keep her bra.</i>

256
00:25:15,198 --> 00:25:18,656
<i>I was determined</i>
<i>to ask for her milk.</i>

257
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:54,064
I'm going.

258
00:25:58,198 --> 00:25:59,825
Give me a kiss.

259
00:26:18,597 --> 00:26:21,225
Don't forget
to buy cauliflower.

260
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:22,923
And the blue cheese!

261
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:39,965
H i.

262
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:41,691
<i>I brought her</i>
<i>the best thing I had.</i>

263
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:43,856
<i>Wally, my frog.</i>

264
00:26:43,964 --> 00:26:45,864
What do you want?

265
00:26:45,964 --> 00:26:48,364
What's your name?

266
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:51,365
Tete.
Here, this is for you.

267
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,365
- He's so pretty.
- H is name is Wally.

268
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:57,795
Yes.

269
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,331
- What is it?
- He likes to drink wine.

270
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,625
Oh, thank you.

271
00:27:07,731 --> 00:27:10,165
<i>She offered me her breast</i>
<i>and I touched it.</i>

272
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:11,788
What are you doing?

273
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,621
I want to drink milk
from one of your breasts.

274
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:20,528
What are you talking about?

275
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,064
It's that my mother
won't give it to me.

276
00:27:31,397 --> 00:27:34,730
Give me some milk, please.

277
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:41,193
<i>She pulled it out...</i>

278
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:45,758
<i>and said I could drink</i>
<i>as much milk as I pleased.</i>

279
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,122
It tastes so good.

280
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,098
Did you like it?

281
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:38,497
Do you want
to give me a kiss?

282
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:41,794
<i>J ust when it was in the bag,</i>
<i>Miguel showed up.</i>

283
00:28:41,897 --> 00:28:44,024
It's M iguel again.

284
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,319
Where are you going?

285
00:28:50,164 --> 00:28:53,190
<i>First, my brother</i>
<i>and now, him.</i>

286
00:28:56,831 --> 00:29:02,064
When dawn breaks

287
00:29:02,164 --> 00:29:06,794
When dawn breaks

288
00:29:06,897 --> 00:29:11,459
If I'm not with you

289
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:14,590
My heart breaks

290
00:29:14,697 --> 00:29:17,097
See?

291
00:29:17,198 --> 00:29:20,463
You feel the electricity too.

292
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:37,760
Tete!

293
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:39,126
Why aren't you at school?

294
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:41,290
Star is mine, only mine!

295
00:29:41,397 --> 00:29:42,694
What?

296
00:29:42,797 --> 00:29:44,059
She showed me her breast!

297
00:29:44,164 --> 00:29:47,565
<i>He wanted to steal her from me</i>
<i>and he was doing it.</i>

298
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:49,928
- It's full of milk.
- Don't start!

299
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:53,159
- She has a great tit!
- I'm sick of you!

300
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:54,230
So am I!

301
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,127
<i>Everybody was against me.</i>

302
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,597
<i>My father, always going on</i>
<i>about having balls...</i>

303
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,858
Oaballé called.

304
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:04,933
I'm sick and tired
of getting complaints about you.

305
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:07,761
- Give him a kiss.
- No.

306
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:10,492
<i>On top of everything,</i>
<i>they wanted me to kiss him.</i>

307
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:14,158
What?
Give him a kiss, damn it.

308
00:30:18,664 --> 00:30:20,427
There, there now.

309
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,657
<i>He disgusted me.</i>

310
00:30:22,764 --> 00:30:25,631
There, there now.

311
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:29,966
<i>The crap was not mine.</i>

312
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,655
Tete!

313
00:30:35,764 --> 00:30:37,095
Oome here.

314
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:44,425
<i>And at school, Caballe, my teacher,</i>
<i>blamed me for everything.</i>

315
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,861
<i>She was like a cow.</i>

316
00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:48,091
I'm sure this was your idea.

317
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:50,893
I'm calling your father
and then you'll see!

318
00:31:09,263 --> 00:31:11,697
<i>I had to get rid</i>
<i>of Miguel.</i>

319
00:31:11,797 --> 00:31:15,961
<i>I was going to live</i>
<i>at the campsite to be near her.</i>

320
00:31:53,731 --> 00:31:58,191
<i>She always appeared</i>
<i>after the boat number.</i>

321
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,192
<i>I wanted to see her</i>
<i>very much.</i>

322
00:33:23,897 --> 00:33:26,388
Did you see
how the mayor eats?

323
00:33:28,564 --> 00:33:29,963
It's hilarious.

324
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,167
I n English
the word is ''fart. ''

325
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:53,332
Maurice, the fartman,
the king of fire.

326
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:50,861
Go away, go away.

327
00:35:50,963 --> 00:35:53,932
If I can't have you...

328
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,088
I'll kill myself.

329
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:56,164
<i>He had gone crazy.</i>

330
00:35:56,263 --> 00:35:59,926
<i>He didn't know what to do</i>
<i>to get her attention.</i>

331
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:04,433
<i>He even told her</i>
<i>he'd commit suicide.</i>

332
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,498
You're crazy.

333
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,094
<i>He followed her everywhere.</i>

334
00:36:16,197 --> 00:36:18,461
<i>He would always be near them.</i>

335
00:36:18,564 --> 00:36:21,931
<i>He'd spend the night</i>
<i>hidden under the trailer.</i>

336
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,793
It's the Oatalan nightingale.

337
00:36:23,896 --> 00:36:27,229
Listen, it's so pretty.

338
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:32,267
- He's in love with me.
- I don't like flamenco music!

339
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:33,956
He must be crazy.

340
00:36:35,464 --> 00:36:37,227
When he looks at me,
he frightens me.

341
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:40,629
Then he really is
in love with you.

342
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,791
You could ask me
if I'm in love with him.

343
00:36:43,896 --> 00:36:46,387
Don't play with fire,
little one.

344
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:02,124
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>I liked about the man...</i>

345
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,722
<i>was that he was also getting</i>
<i>sick and tired of Miguel.</i>

346
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,424
I don't like flamenco music!

347
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,559
<i>Stallone was right...</i>

348
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,258
<i>he said the French</i>
<i>were very strange...</i>

349
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:19,265
<i>she loved to suck on his toes.</i>

350
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:20,558
What do they taste like?

351
00:37:22,263 --> 00:37:23,787
What do they taste like?

352
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:25,295
Oauliflower.

353
00:37:27,364 --> 00:37:30,663
Like a hot croissant, blue cheese.

354
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:37,761
It's better than blue cheese.

355
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,930
It's getting harder for me
to get it up.

356
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,022
I use up all my energy
with the farting.

357
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,327
I'll never get it up
like I used to.

358
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,058
It's the cauliflower
that wears you out, right?

359
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:55,494
No...

360
00:37:55,597 --> 00:37:58,930
it's the Oatalan Vichy.

361
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,727
If you look closely,
the bubbles aren't round.

362
00:38:08,731 --> 00:38:10,221
I love you.

363
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,355
Yes, you do now...

364
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:14,830
but someday you'll find
someone younger than me...

365
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,831
who will make love to you
like a god.

366
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,559
I'll never leave you.

367
00:38:24,097 --> 00:38:26,395
You're stronger than fire.

368
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:30,627
When you do the cannon,
you burn like the devil.

369
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:42,125
Are you going to start crying?
Do you want the jar?

370
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,021
<i>She also liked it</i>
<i>when he cried.</i>

371
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,691
<i>She collected tears</i>
<i>in a jar.</i>

372
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:04,229
Please, if you cry
you excite me even more.

373
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:16,331
I've never understood
why my tears excite you.

374
00:39:21,497 --> 00:39:24,557
It tastes
of the Mediterranean Sea.

375
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:33,423
Dark alley

376
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:37,864
there's no way out

377
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:41,797
<i>It was incredible,</i>
<i>Miguel sang to her every night.</i>

378
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:43,727
<i>He was a jerk.</i>

379
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,190
Dark alley

380
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:31,860
There's no way out

381
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:57,957
Even if it's not true

382
00:40:58,063 --> 00:41:03,365
Because I'm afraid

383
00:41:03,464 --> 00:41:14,807
Of daylight

384
00:41:42,863 --> 00:41:45,423
- I'll go check it out.
- No, stay with me.

385
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,260
We don't need electricity,
just us and the moon.

386
00:41:48,364 --> 00:41:50,423
It's so romantic.

387
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,221
<i>I went there to tell her...</i>

388
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,059
<i>I was going to live</i>
<i>on the campsite.</i>

389
00:42:08,163 --> 00:42:09,494
Go away.

390
00:42:10,563 --> 00:42:13,259
No, I've come to see Star.

391
00:42:23,364 --> 00:42:26,765
It must be the wires.

392
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:39,726
What's this?
It's disgusting.

393
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,288
Leave it, a little boy
gave it to me, he's so sweet.

394
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:45,558
I'm tired of kids and children...

395
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,756
- I don't want this here.
- No.

396
00:42:49,997 --> 00:42:52,761
<i>He was an animal,</i>
<i>he almost killed Wally...</i>

397
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:55,457
<i>who was blameless</i>
<i>in the whole thing.</i>

398
00:42:55,563 --> 00:42:59,590
<i>It's a good thing Star liked him</i>
<i>and gave him a home.</i>

399
00:43:00,963 --> 00:43:02,658
Now we're going
to play baguette.

400
00:43:02,763 --> 00:43:05,391
<i>He made her wash</i>
<i>the French flag every day...</i>

401
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:08,465
<i>and at night he'd force her</i>
<i>to eat bread.</i>

402
00:43:08,563 --> 00:43:09,996
<i>A baguette.</i>

403
00:43:10,097 --> 00:43:11,689
It's old bread.

404
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:13,730
<i>All she wanted</i>
<i>was for him to fill her.</i>

405
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,991
It'll be harder.

406
00:43:23,364 --> 00:43:26,026
Go home, don't make me angry
or I'll tell your dad.

407
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:30,533
If you tell my dad,
I'll tell Star you cut the power.

408
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,997
Slowly.

409
00:43:42,963 --> 00:43:44,760
Slowly.

410
00:43:47,629 --> 00:43:48,596
Go on.

411
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:55,030
J ust one hand.

412
00:44:03,496 --> 00:44:07,865
- What's going on there?
- We'd better go.

413
00:44:07,963 --> 00:44:12,332
She hasn't given you her breast
and her milk, she has to me.

414
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:14,556
Yes, but I have this.

415
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:19,263
And I have this,
it's her bra, look!

416
00:44:21,063 --> 00:44:25,159
<i>I had to leave,</i>
<i>he didn't let me stay at the campsite.</i>

417
00:44:26,796 --> 00:44:32,325
<i>I didn't want to be with my parents</i>
<i>nor with my brother, the monster.</i>

418
00:44:32,429 --> 00:44:35,296
Where were you?

419
00:44:35,396 --> 00:44:38,297
You can't go out
without telling us.

420
00:44:38,396 --> 00:44:40,660
Father, I need to talk to you.

421
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:42,924
What's going on?

422
00:44:44,396 --> 00:44:45,795
I've fallen in love.

423
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:48,797
You're in love?
With who?

424
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:50,727
A breast.

425
00:44:52,796 --> 00:44:55,026
Are you feeling badly?

426
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,563
Open your mouth.

427
00:44:56,663 --> 00:44:59,632
- Show me your molars.
- My mouth is fine.

428
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,665
Oome on,
open wider.

429
00:45:02,763 --> 00:45:06,529
<i>As always,</i>
<i>he only worried about my teeth.</i>

430
00:45:06,629 --> 00:45:08,221
Who did you say you love?

431
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:11,629
- A breast.
- A breast?

432
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:13,197
Tete.

433
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,625
A good Roman like your father,
like you...

434
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:21,790
first you must consider your duties
before women.

435
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:25,356
And you are a crown.

436
00:45:28,629 --> 00:45:31,894
<i>He always carried on</i>
<i>about how we were Romans...</i>

437
00:45:31,997 --> 00:45:35,228
<i>and that we owed everything</i>
<i>to them.</i>

438
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:37,126
<i>He was crazy.</i>

439
00:45:40,763 --> 00:45:43,732
<i>He'd take us</i>
<i>to the Roman monuments...</i>

440
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:48,460
<i>to touch the stones</i>
<i>and have their strength.</i>

441
00:46:01,696 --> 00:46:03,493
<i>He was such a pain...</i>

442
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:07,032
<i>he'd take us to the monuments</i>
<i>even if it rained...</i>

443
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,064
<i>and we couldn't escape.</i>

444
00:46:12,296 --> 00:46:14,127
Press hard!

445
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,596
Let the strength of the stone
reach your heart...

446
00:46:16,696 --> 00:46:19,426
your arms and your balls!

447
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:21,724
Bear with this rain
that falls from the heavens!

448
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:24,264
Everything desintegrates,
changes, dies!

449
00:46:24,363 --> 00:46:26,388
Except stone.

450
00:46:26,496 --> 00:46:28,327
The Romans left us so much!

451
00:46:28,429 --> 00:46:31,398
We're all Romans!
Romans in spirit!

452
00:46:31,496 --> 00:46:33,123
Shout all together!

453
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:43,455
<i>Since I couldn't live</i>
<i>on the campsite...</i>

454
00:46:43,563 --> 00:46:47,294
<i>Miguel took advantage</i>
<i>of the situation.</i>

455
00:46:47,396 --> 00:46:48,886
H i.

456
00:46:48,997 --> 00:46:50,692
I can't sleep.

457
00:46:51,763 --> 00:46:53,731
All I do
is think of is you.

458
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:59,526
<i>He insisted</i>
<i>but she kept him away.</i>

459
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:14,429
<i>Star was in love with her man</i>
<i>but they had problems.</i>

460
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:16,224
It's my fault.

461
00:47:17,863 --> 00:47:20,661
I'm happy and I love you.

462
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:25,091
Besides, I'm jealous.

463
00:47:29,896 --> 00:47:31,921
And I don't like it.

464
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,623
That means you love me.

465
00:47:44,563 --> 00:47:48,294
Someday, I'll lock you in your box...

466
00:47:48,396 --> 00:47:51,297
and I'll go far away with it.

467
00:47:56,463 --> 00:47:59,830
So you'll never be able
to leave me.

468
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:05,827
Will you do the cannon for me?

469
00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:12,627
- The big one?
- Yes.

470
00:48:20,629 --> 00:48:22,028
I love you.

471
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:24,792
<i>If she liked the farts...</i>

472
00:48:24,896 --> 00:48:28,593
<i>I was going to learn how to fart</i>
<i>and louder than him.</i>

473
00:48:28,696 --> 00:48:30,891
What are you doing?

474
00:48:30,997 --> 00:48:33,227
- What her husband does.
- Who?

475
00:48:35,796 --> 00:48:39,254
Oome on, it'll get cold.
Sit down.

476
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:41,388
Aren't stringbeans better?

477
00:48:41,496 --> 00:48:45,694
That's what everyone thinks
but cauliflower is better for farting.

478
00:48:48,763 --> 00:48:53,826
People think farting is terrible
but some things are much worse.

479
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:57,366
Wars, banks,
noise of planes, traffic...

480
00:48:57,463 --> 00:48:58,430
and Oaballe!

481
00:48:58,529 --> 00:49:00,224
What are you doing here?

482
00:49:00,329 --> 00:49:03,093
<i>Everyone said that my granpa</i>
<i>was crazy...</i>

483
00:49:03,196 --> 00:49:05,858
<i>because when he got angry</i>
<i>he'd break a wine bottle...</i>

484
00:49:05,963 --> 00:49:09,797
<i>and he always had problems</i>
<i>with his rooster.</i>

485
00:49:09,896 --> 00:49:12,922
<i>But he was the only one</i>
<i>who understood me.</i>

486
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:17,260
It's a shame about Oaballe,
he sings so well.

487
00:49:17,363 --> 00:49:21,697
No, I mean
my English teacher.

488
00:49:24,363 --> 00:49:28,322
At school,
a fart drives away evil spirits.

489
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:30,294
Go on, eat,
it'll get cold.

490
00:49:30,396 --> 00:49:32,796
Go on, eat.

491
00:49:32,896 --> 00:49:32,963
<i>Miguel was down in the dumps.</i>

492
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:35,830
<i>Miguel was down in the dumps.</i>

493
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:38,865
<i>Stallone was the only</i>
<i>happy guy around...</i>

494
00:49:38,963 --> 00:49:41,830
<i>with his new Kawasaki 750.</i>

495
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:49,455
What's wrong, M iguel?

496
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,426
I need her.

497
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:56,623
I can't get her out of my mind.

498
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,426
I should just kill myself.

499
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:02,396
Nobody kills himself here
without my permission.

500
00:50:02,496 --> 00:50:06,865
Listen, you have to snap
out of it.

501
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:08,362
You're hurting yourself.

502
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:12,554
These are hard times for me.

503
00:50:14,496 --> 00:50:17,329
You need to wait
just a few more screws.

504
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:19,488
Don't speak that way.

505
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:23,696
When we get to Oalifornia...

506
00:50:23,796 --> 00:50:25,559
you'll see you can live without her.

507
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:27,858
There are so many girls there.

508
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:33,626
Want a ride on the bike?

509
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,028
Oome on, I'll take you home.

510
00:50:36,129 --> 00:50:38,461
Oome on, M iguel.

511
00:50:38,563 --> 00:50:41,191
She's beautiful.

512
00:50:41,296 --> 00:50:44,197
How she shines.

513
00:50:44,296 --> 00:50:45,263
Get on.

514
00:50:47,363 --> 00:50:50,730
<i>They were hard times for me too.</i>

515
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:52,821
<i>I didn't have her breast</i>
<i>nor her milk...</i>

516
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:56,024
<i>and then my father</i>
<i>took what little I had.</i>

517
00:50:56,996 --> 00:50:59,089
Where did you get this?

518
00:51:00,196 --> 00:51:03,063
What are you doing?
Where did you get this?

519
00:51:03,162 --> 00:51:05,528
- From the foreigner.
- What foreigner?

520
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,187
The one at Oava Park.

521
00:51:07,296 --> 00:51:10,094
What the hell were you doing
at Oava Park?

522
00:52:02,262 --> 00:52:04,628
Tete!
Get up here!

523
00:53:09,529 --> 00:53:11,759
<i>Poor Stallone died.</i>

524
00:53:11,862 --> 00:53:15,764
<i>Grandpa got real angry,</i>
<i>he said it wasn't right.</i>

525
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:18,797
<i>He started smashing wine bottles</i>
<i>like crazy.</i>

526
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:22,262
<i>He said it was the best way</i>
<i>to get rid of the anger.</i>

527
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:30,857
<i>We were all so sad.</i>

528
00:53:30,962 --> 00:53:34,454
<i>Seeing my parents cry</i>
<i>made a deep impression on me.</i>

529
00:53:42,296 --> 00:53:45,925
<i>Stallone was dead</i>
<i>but I knew he'd return...</i>

530
00:53:46,029 --> 00:53:51,661
<i>at least to pick his mother up</i>
<i>because she always asked him to.</i>

531
00:54:10,795 --> 00:54:13,923
<i>Miguel sang to him</i>
<i>with great feeling.</i>

532
00:54:48,762 --> 00:54:52,425
<i>Star was moved</i>
<i>when she saw him crying.</i>

533
00:54:52,529 --> 00:54:56,795
<i>I'm sure she wanted to save</i>
<i>his tears in her jar.</i>

534
00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:03,487
- He's dead.
- I know.

535
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:09,131
- He was my best friend.
- Don't say a word.

536
00:55:15,596 --> 00:55:18,724
Please don't cry,
I can't bear to see your tears.

537
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:20,729
I need you.

538
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:53,097
I'm sorry about your friend.

539
00:55:56,062 --> 00:56:00,021
<i>Whenever the Frenchman left,</i>
<i>Miguel would sing to her endlessly.</i>

540
00:56:00,129 --> 00:56:04,828
<i>She felt very sorry for Miguel</i>
<i>since Stallone died.</i>

541
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:07,929
D O N OT TO U O H
RI S K O F D EAT H

542
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:09,487
D O N OT TO U O H
RI S K O F D EAT H

543
00:56:13,663 --> 00:56:16,257
Moon, aren't you tired

544
00:56:16,363 --> 00:56:22,495
of going to the same world

545
00:56:24,129 --> 00:56:30,557
Oh, moon, stay with me,
don't leave

546
00:56:30,662 --> 00:56:34,223
because they say

547
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:39,824
the dawn is coming,
the dawn is coming

548
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:44,825
You're crazy,
what are you doing here?

549
00:56:44,929 --> 00:56:49,457
I like the rain,
it seems the sky also weeps.

550
00:56:52,962 --> 00:56:54,862
I like your tears.

551
00:56:58,363 --> 00:57:02,561
You know,
I've also felt the electricity.

552
00:57:07,463 --> 00:57:09,294
Touch me.

553
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,627
I love your skin.

554
00:57:18,429 --> 00:57:20,693
I love your lips.

555
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:27,363
Don't be sad.

556
00:57:27,463 --> 00:57:30,057
Let's go inside,
you're getting wet.

557
00:57:39,129 --> 00:57:40,994
<i>He was filling her.</i>

558
00:57:41,096 --> 00:57:45,430
<i>She liked it when they sang to her</i>
<i>and when they filled her.</i>

559
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:49,761
<i>Stallone was right,</i>
<i>French women were sluts.</i>

560
00:58:04,762 --> 00:58:08,789
<i>The Frenchman was desperate</i>
<i>but he didn't say a word.</i>

561
00:58:08,895 --> 00:58:12,353
<i>Since he couldn't fill her,</i>
<i>he let Miguel do it.</i>

562
00:58:12,463 --> 00:58:16,695
<i>People said that this happened</i>
<i>because the French were so modern...</i>

563
00:58:16,795 --> 00:58:18,490
<i>and because he was older</i>
<i>than her.</i>

564
00:58:42,363 --> 00:58:44,923
Go.

565
00:58:47,062 --> 00:58:50,554
To understand what I'm going through,
I need much patience...

566
00:58:50,662 --> 00:58:53,130
and I'm not getting it.

567
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,595
Why must you take care
of whoever suffers?

568
00:58:55,695 --> 00:58:59,859
I n exchange for a caress,
a compliment, you'd give it all.

569
00:58:59,962 --> 00:59:04,626
I loved you more than anything
in the world, understand?

570
00:59:04,729 --> 00:59:07,425
I can't understand
what you see in him!

571
00:59:07,528 --> 00:59:09,428
When he sings,
he has the voice of an angel.

572
00:59:09,528 --> 00:59:11,758
What do you know
about angels?

573
00:59:11,862 --> 00:59:14,330
Have you ever heard one?

574
00:59:17,862 --> 00:59:19,955
Why are you crying?

575
00:59:20,062 --> 00:59:22,758
No, it's the shampoo,
the shampoo in my eyes.

576
00:59:22,862 --> 00:59:26,298
Yeah, Spanish shampoo,
it's crap.

577
00:59:32,562 --> 00:59:34,086
Get in there, inside.

578
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:37,359
- Let me go!
- It's your castle!

579
00:59:37,463 --> 00:59:39,863
You'll stay in your castle,
like all queens do.

580
00:59:39,962 --> 00:59:43,022
Queens stay in their castles.
Star!

581
00:59:43,129 --> 00:59:46,064
- Open up!
- No!

582
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:48,756
- Open up!
- You're my queen, it's your castle!

583
00:59:48,862 --> 00:59:50,625
So stay in your castle!

584
00:59:50,729 --> 00:59:52,560
- Maurice!
- U nderstand?

585
00:59:52,662 --> 00:59:55,597
Open the door!
Maurice!

586
00:59:57,429 --> 00:59:58,589
Open!

587
01:00:24,729 --> 01:00:29,428
<i>I went to Stallone's grave,</i>
<i>I was sure he'd be there.</i>

588
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:38,027
H i, Stallone.

589
01:00:39,162 --> 01:00:41,790
Are you very sleepy?

590
01:00:59,862 --> 01:01:02,490
I need some flowers.

591
01:01:02,595 --> 01:01:03,926
Oan I take some?

592
01:01:13,428 --> 01:01:15,623
<i>I wanted Star to comfort me...</i>

593
01:01:15,729 --> 01:01:19,859
<i>and if she wouldn't</i>
<i>then I'd kill myself too.</i>

594
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:41,558
I can't get out.

595
01:01:41,662 --> 01:01:44,153
- They're so pretty.
- They're for you.

596
01:01:44,262 --> 01:01:46,594
Oan I come in?
I want to say something to you.

597
01:01:46,695 --> 01:01:48,322
Try to open the door.

598
01:01:52,428 --> 01:01:55,363
No, that door's locked.

599
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:58,158
Go to the back.

600
01:02:09,662 --> 01:02:14,292
<i>She needed me, I'd save her</i>
<i>and we'd run away together forever.</i>

601
01:02:14,395 --> 01:02:17,296
<i>Far away from the Frenchman</i>
<i>and Miguel, that foreigner.</i>

602
01:02:17,395 --> 01:02:20,023
<i>Her breast would be just for me.</i>

603
01:02:25,296 --> 01:02:28,356
Slow down,
don't hurt yourself.

604
01:02:28,462 --> 01:02:31,795
- Help me.
- There you go.

605
01:02:31,895 --> 01:02:33,863
I'm so glad you came.

606
01:02:42,462 --> 01:02:43,429
Star?

607
01:02:50,895 --> 01:02:54,695
M iguel! Leave!
Maurice is coming any minute!

608
01:02:54,795 --> 01:02:55,955
Who gave you these flowers?

609
01:03:03,695 --> 01:03:06,255
It's him! It's Maurice. Go away!

610
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:19,489
Are those flowers yours?

611
01:03:23,628 --> 01:03:24,686
Oan you climb over?

612
01:03:25,462 --> 01:03:28,022
Are these flowers yours?
Are they yours?

613
01:03:28,129 --> 01:03:29,790
Are they yours?

614
01:03:35,328 --> 01:03:36,386
You'll swallow them!

615
01:03:37,528 --> 01:03:39,120
Stop!

616
01:03:40,462 --> 01:03:41,929
Maurice! Leave him alone!

617
01:03:42,029 --> 01:03:43,553
Leave him alone!

618
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:51,430
- I'll kill you!
- Stop now! Leave him alone!

619
01:03:56,062 --> 01:03:58,792
Stop it! Leave him alone!

620
01:03:59,162 --> 01:04:01,858
<i>I had to throw myself on top</i>
<i>of them and pull them apart.</i>

621
01:04:02,029 --> 01:04:06,022
<i>Thanks to me, the frenchie didn't</i>
<i>kill him. I shattered his motorbike.</i>

622
01:04:07,196 --> 01:04:08,163
Frenchie!

623
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:10,922
Stop!

624
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:22,423
Get inside! Oome on!

625
01:04:29,862 --> 01:04:32,092
<i>Miguel thanked me for saving him.</i>

626
01:04:32,195 --> 01:04:35,596
<i>If it weren't because of her,</i>
<i>we would be friends again.</i>

627
01:04:35,695 --> 01:04:37,754
<i>We both loved her.</i>

628
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:05,894
Why did you put those glasses on?

629
01:05:13,762 --> 01:05:16,287
It's that shampoo
that makes you cry?

630
01:05:17,729 --> 01:05:20,095
The sun bothers me.

631
01:05:26,528 --> 01:05:28,428
The sun on your face.

632
01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:32,089
I don't know where I'm standing.

633
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:35,221
I don't want to hurt you.
I feel so bad.

634
01:05:41,795 --> 01:05:42,762
Shit.

635
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,862
Fuck passion!

636
01:05:54,628 --> 01:05:58,860
Fuck the spanish sun! And the blue
lake and your bullfighting!

637
01:05:59,228 --> 01:06:01,423
First it was my saliva
and now it's his voice!

638
01:06:01,528 --> 01:06:03,496
Fuck his flamenco music!

639
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:08,353
This country will drive me crazy!

640
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:11,397
- Where are you going?
- I'm going away! Far from here!

641
01:06:17,362 --> 01:06:20,854
<i>If I wanted to take Star with me</i>
<i>I would need my father's army.</i>

642
01:06:20,962 --> 01:06:23,123
<i>His Roman Legion.</i>

643
01:06:23,228 --> 01:06:27,028
<i>But he still didn't forgive me</i>
<i>that bra thing.</i>

644
01:07:07,328 --> 01:07:09,990
Men! Forward!

645
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:13,827
<i>I couldn't count on him.</i>

646
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:17,626
<i>The only thing I could do</i>
<i>was make a deal with Miguel.</i>

647
01:07:17,729 --> 01:07:19,890
<i>But he didn't want</i>
<i>to listen to me.</i>

648
01:07:19,996 --> 01:07:24,399
<i>He kept saying, ''Leave me alone,</i>
<i>Tete. I'm mad about her. ''</i>

649
01:07:24,695 --> 01:07:26,219
<i>What a drag I</i>

650
01:07:27,729 --> 01:07:31,529
<i>As he knew that she liked tears...</i>

651
01:07:31,628 --> 01:07:33,220
<i>he wouldn't stop crying.</i>

652
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,058
If I can't live with you...

653
01:07:37,161 --> 01:07:38,788
I'll kill myself.

654
01:07:39,562 --> 01:07:41,962
Don't ever say that again!

655
01:07:42,428 --> 01:07:43,793
You scare me.

656
01:07:53,962 --> 01:07:57,329
<i>She smelled her feet and that was it.</i>

657
01:07:57,428 --> 01:07:59,589
<i>She was all dazed.</i>

658
01:08:46,495 --> 01:08:47,962
<i>I couldn't let that happen.</i>

659
01:08:48,061 --> 01:08:51,497
<i>If frenchie didn't do anything,</i>
<i>I would do it myself.</i>

660
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:53,859
<i>I would separate her from Miguel.</i>

661
01:08:59,528 --> 01:09:01,496
<i>He was filling her up.</i>

662
01:09:01,795 --> 01:09:04,093
<i>I didn't dare go in.</i>

663
01:09:10,495 --> 01:09:11,462
Yes!

664
01:09:14,595 --> 01:09:17,063
Sing to me!

665
01:09:23,095 --> 01:09:24,187
Louder!

666
01:09:31,829 --> 01:09:33,820
Louder! Louder!

667
01:09:39,328 --> 01:09:41,228
Louder!

668
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:50,861
Yes!

669
01:09:51,829 --> 01:09:53,319
Sing to me! Sing to me!

670
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:06,855
Louder! Sing! Sing!

671
01:10:10,628 --> 01:10:11,595
Yes!

672
01:10:20,261 --> 01:10:25,255
<i>Shit I This dude, with his tears,</i>
<i>the smell on his feet and his songs...</i>

673
01:10:25,362 --> 01:10:27,557
<i>will rip her up.</i>

674
01:10:31,562 --> 01:10:35,362
<i>All of a sudden, milk started</i>
<i>pouring out. Lots of milk.</i>

675
01:10:36,828 --> 01:10:38,591
<i>He did rip her upl</i>

676
01:11:00,362 --> 01:11:02,353
<i>That's Miguel's fault.</i>

677
01:11:02,662 --> 01:11:04,653
<i>He left me without her breast.</i>

678
01:11:05,495 --> 01:11:08,487
Maurice is the man of my life.

679
01:11:09,095 --> 01:11:11,461
I don't want to hurt him.

680
01:11:14,195 --> 01:11:16,095
It's not possible.

681
01:11:16,995 --> 01:11:18,895
You have to understand.

682
01:11:20,128 --> 01:11:22,028
What's wrong?

683
01:11:24,928 --> 01:11:27,055
It's all wet!

684
01:11:28,695 --> 01:11:29,662
He'll kill me!

685
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:41,359
<i>When the frenchie came,</i>
<i>I got scared.</i>

686
01:11:41,462 --> 01:11:42,429
H i.

687
01:11:44,662 --> 01:11:45,629
Don't be afraid.

688
01:11:46,562 --> 01:11:47,995
Go home.

689
01:11:52,828 --> 01:11:56,559
<i>I didn't have the balls</i>
<i>to go in or fight him.</i>

690
01:12:00,195 --> 01:12:04,928
<i>My father was right.</i>
<i>I have no balls at all.</i>

691
01:12:09,462 --> 01:12:14,365
<i>She was sorry</i>
<i>and regretted what she had done.</i>

692
01:12:15,362 --> 01:12:18,422
- Forgive me.
- Why?

693
01:12:20,528 --> 01:12:23,964
Because I let you do
what you wanted.

694
01:12:26,695 --> 01:12:27,923
Fuck freedom!

695
01:12:31,728 --> 01:12:34,822
I'd rather
you had beaten me up...

696
01:12:34,928 --> 01:12:36,361
and gone away.

697
01:12:36,462 --> 01:12:38,453
It's been a bad dream.

698
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:48,656
Tell me that you love me.

699
01:12:56,095 --> 01:12:57,084
I love you.

700
01:13:07,694 --> 01:13:10,219
But I can't forgive you for
breaking the mattress.

701
01:13:10,562 --> 01:13:13,463
It cost more than 10, 000 francs.

702
01:13:20,161 --> 01:13:21,992
Where will we sleep tonight?

703
01:13:23,861 --> 01:13:26,455
Tonight, I want you
to perform your act.

704
01:13:26,928 --> 01:13:29,158
J ust for me and me alone!

705
01:13:34,628 --> 01:13:36,960
- Who is my muse?
- I am!

706
01:13:37,061 --> 01:13:39,996
- The one that inspires my best farts!
- That's me!

707
01:13:40,661 --> 01:13:42,424
The one that inflames the wind!

708
01:13:47,395 --> 01:13:48,362
Me!

709
01:13:49,128 --> 01:13:50,959
The one that ignites the cannon!

710
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:52,395
Me.

711
01:13:58,995 --> 01:14:01,088
I wont ever leave you.

712
01:14:04,595 --> 01:14:06,722
I wont ever leave you.

713
01:14:11,928 --> 01:14:13,020
I love you.

714
01:14:17,462 --> 01:14:18,520
I love you.

715
01:14:20,295 --> 01:14:22,024
You'll have whatever you want.

716
01:14:23,495 --> 01:14:24,462
The moon.

717
01:14:25,362 --> 01:14:27,057
- The flowers.
- A new mattress?

718
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:28,128
Yes.

719
01:14:33,462 --> 01:14:35,896
Filled with our tears.

720
01:14:37,228 --> 01:14:38,889
A bed of tears.

721
01:14:39,728 --> 01:14:42,959
<i>She was empty.</i>
<i>She had no more milk.</i>

722
01:14:43,362 --> 01:14:45,193
<i>And they didn't stop crying.</i>

723
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:50,188
<i>They really loved each other a lot.</i>
<i>He was a lucky frenchie.</i>

724
01:14:53,661 --> 01:14:55,185
<i>If I wanted her breast...</i>

725
01:14:55,295 --> 01:14:57,661
<i>I would have to</i>
<i>make a deal with him.</i>

726
01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:33,119
<i>They went without saying a word.</i>

727
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:38,063
<i>She gave me Wally back</i>
<i>and Miguel got her panties.</i>

728
01:15:56,894 --> 01:16:01,422
<i>I couldn't understand</i>
<i>why the moon had taken Star away.</i>

729
01:16:01,594 --> 01:16:03,528
<i>It was all over.</i>

730
01:16:03,627 --> 01:16:07,654
<i>She was empty</i>
<i>and they had gone.</i>

731
01:16:16,627 --> 01:16:20,620
<i>Miguel was very upset.</i>
<i>He kept saying...</i>

732
01:16:20,728 --> 01:16:22,559
<i>''I can't live without her. ''</i>

733
01:16:22,728 --> 01:16:24,252
<i>He tried to commit suicide.</i>

734
01:16:24,362 --> 01:16:27,092
<i>But fortunately,</i>
<i>as Stallone said...</i>

735
01:16:27,195 --> 01:16:33,156
<i>''The Mediterranean is for children. ''</i>
<i>He couldn't do it.</i>

736
01:17:03,861 --> 01:17:06,591
O'mon. Be a man.
Hold firmly in the middle!

737
01:17:06,894 --> 01:17:08,054
Don't be a chicken.

738
01:17:09,395 --> 01:17:10,362
O'mon! O'mon!

739
01:17:11,594 --> 01:17:14,290
Tete, quick! To the middle!
You're almost there!

740
01:17:15,128 --> 01:17:16,823
Go, Tete! To the top!

741
01:17:38,128 --> 01:17:40,221
Well done, Tete!
You're getting there!

742
01:17:40,627 --> 01:17:41,594
Don't look down!

743
01:17:47,328 --> 01:17:48,522
Look at the sky!

744
01:17:53,661 --> 01:17:54,889
Damn! Don't stop!

745
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,021
Don't stop, Tete! Don't stop!

746
01:18:07,394 --> 01:18:08,725
Tete! Shit! Further up!

747
01:18:13,362 --> 01:18:15,922
Tete! Don't stop!

748
01:18:16,295 --> 01:18:18,525
Don't stop, Tete! Don't stop!

749
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:20,561
Olimb up! Don't look down!

750
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:29,420
Tete! Look up! U p!

751
01:18:29,561 --> 01:18:32,894
U p! You're almost there!

752
01:18:33,128 --> 01:18:36,154
Keep going! You're almost there!

753
01:18:38,794 --> 01:18:40,694
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>I saw her. She was...</i>

754
01:18:40,794 --> 01:18:42,955
<i>next to my father.</i>

755
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:11,388
<i>Miguel also saw her.</i>
<i>He was very happy.</i>

756
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:31,822
<i>I did it. I felt</i>
<i>I had touched the moon.</i>

757
01:19:45,761 --> 01:19:49,629
<i>She gave me her milk.</i>
<i>Her breasts was bursting.</i>

758
01:19:50,095 --> 01:19:52,723
<i>It was delicious and very sweet.</i>

759
01:20:24,294 --> 01:20:27,263
<i>The best thing of all was</i>
<i>that my mother came too...</i>

760
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:28,589
<i>and gave me her milk.</i>

761
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:35,991
<i>She told me, that from now on</i>
<i>I could always have it.</i>

762
01:20:39,028 --> 01:20:42,020
<i>It was better</i>
<i>than Star's milk.</i>

763
01:20:58,794 --> 01:21:00,887
<i>They both wanted me to have it.</i>

764
01:21:08,627 --> 01:21:10,618
<i>It was the happiest day in my life.</i>

765
01:21:10,861 --> 01:21:15,662
<i>My father now says that his son</i>
<i>has the balls of a bull.</i>

766
01:21:16,061 --> 01:21:19,292
<i>I had no balls at all,</i>
<i>and now they're like a bull's.</i>

767
01:21:22,694 --> 01:21:24,889
<i>It was also the best</i>
<i>day for Miguel.</i>

768
01:21:25,828 --> 01:21:28,296
<i>Star took him along with them.</i>

769
01:21:37,594 --> 01:21:39,687
<i>It was wonderful getting</i>
<i>to know her.</i>

770
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:42,490
<i>She was very happy.</i>
<i>The frenchie loved her...</i>

771
01:21:42,594 --> 01:21:44,585
<i>and Miguel filled her up</i>
<i>every night.</i>

772
01:22:03,828 --> 01:22:05,728
<i>I preferred staying</i>
<i>with my mother.</i>

773
01:22:06,394 --> 01:22:08,419
<i>My parents were right.</i>

774
01:22:08,527 --> 01:22:12,054
<i>A tooth was coming through</i>
<i>and I had to go to the dentist.</i>
