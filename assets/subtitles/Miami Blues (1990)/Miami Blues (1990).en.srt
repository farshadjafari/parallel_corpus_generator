1
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,131
When I die and they lay me to rest

2
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,093
Gonna go to the place that's the best

3
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,846
When I lay me down to die

4
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:16,475
Goin' up to the spirit in the sky

5
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:20,230
- Goin' up to the spirit in the sky
- Spirit in the sky

6
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:23,984
- It's where I'm gonna go when I die
- When I die

7
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,902
When I die and they lay me to rest

8
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:31,373
I'm gonna go
to the place that's the best

9
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:49,843
Prepare yourself, you know it's a must

10
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:53,847
Gotta have a friend in Jesus

11
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,307
So you know that when you die

12
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:01,271
He's gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky

13
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,150
Gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky

14
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,986
- That's where you're gonna go when you die
- When you die

15
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,865
When you die and they lay you to rest

16
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,293
You're gonna go to the place
that's the best...

17
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:38,849
Oh, thank you very much.
May I trouble you for a pillow?

18
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:40,984
- Sure.
- Great. Thank you.

19
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:18,056
The temperature in Miami
is currently 86 degrees and muggy.

20
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,100
We will be starting our descent
for landing in just a few moments...

21
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,603
Herman Gotlieb...

22
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,271
Gotlieb.

23
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,024
Please remain seated
with your seat belts on

24
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:30,825
until the captain has
turned off the seat belt sign.

25
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,959
All passengers holding tickets

26
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:50,344
to Eastern Flight 162 to Tampa
please come to the ticket counter.

27
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:03,977
Hey.

28
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,152
Wow, thanks.

29
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:13,068
All passengers leaving on Flight 266

30
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,488
please go directly
to the check-in desk at Gate 6.

31
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:18,240
All passengers leaving...

32
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,908
Hi.

33
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,163
Please go directly
to the check-in desk at Gate 6.

34
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,879
Hi.

35
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,836
Hi there. Going home?
I'd like to tell you about a book.

36
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:33,846
It's a classic of the Vedic literature,
"The Knowledge of God."

37
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,516
Have you seen the movie "Gandhi?"

38
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,730
My name's Ravindra. What's your name?

39
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,019
Trouble.

40
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:30,939
Mr. Gotlieb.

41
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,612
You know, anything you want...

42
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,413
Hey, send me up a girl, Pablo. Now.

43
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,869
You got any of that hundred
I gave you last week?

44
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:46,579
I got all of it, man.

45
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:48,872
But I'm not lending you no more money.

46
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,668
Come on, Blink.
Look, 50 bucks till payday.

47
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,767
Moseley. Homicide.

48
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:05,139
A what died?

49
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:07,857
All right. Right away.

50
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:12,480
I'll pay to find the dumbbell killers.

51
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:14,029
What's it worth to you?

52
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,987
$61 .35.

53
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:21,495
$65.59.

54
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,454
Thanks, Blink.

55
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:31,130
Hey, man, replace your teeth.

56
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,939
Hi.

57
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:51,901
Pablo sent me.

58
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,610
How old are you anyway?

59
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:03,038
19. And my name is Pepper.

60
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:07,416
You got a driver's license
on you, Pepper?

61
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:23,432
What's wrong with Susan Waggoner?

62
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:28,221
You know, Susie, this license here
says you're 23 years old.

63
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,980
I know what it says.

64
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,942
You can call me Junior.

65
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,230
You around a size 7?

66
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,689
Where?

67
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,149
Dress.

68
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,567
Oh.

69
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,536
Uh... 6.

70
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:47,449
Sometimes 7. Depends on...

71
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,418
- Here. Try this on.
- Okay.

72
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,457
Could you turn around, please?

73
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:57,300
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you.

74
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,071
Okay.

75
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,483
Can you zip me up?

76
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,074
Yeah.

77
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,875
Oh...

78
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:39,168
That looks nice to me.

79
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,443
You want me to wear it?

80
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:45,389
Fuck, no. I want you to buy it.

81
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,980
50 bucks?

82
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,610
It might be worth a suck.

83
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,658
Is that what you're getting
for a suck these days, 50 bucks?

84
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,870
Christ.

85
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:10,164
Where'd you get all these nice things?

86
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:16,581
Oh, when I left my wife,
I took 'em with me.

87
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,916
Figure I paid for 'em.
They're my clothes, right?

88
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:20,674
Oh.

89
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,341
You left your wife?

90
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,969
How long you been working for Pablo?

91
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:33,514
Since the beginning of the semester.
I go to Miami-Dade.

92
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,475
I-I'm majoring in business,
but I also take English classes...

93
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,686
Yeah, well, the first thing
they should have taught you

94
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,105
at your hooker classes
is you shouldn't ask the client

95
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,323
so many fucking personal questions.

96
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,749
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,212
Are you going to call down
and cancel me now?

98
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:01,667
That's okay. Don't feel bad about it.

99
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,836
Um... I hope, uh...
the next girl's more to your liking,

100
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,965
and I hope that you enjoy
your stay in Florida. Mr. Gotlieb.

101
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:12,059
- I'm giving you your dress back.
- No, forget about the dress.

102
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,394
Honey...

103
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:19,984
If I upset you, I'm sorry.

104
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,022
So you want me to stay?

105
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:24,905
Yeah.

106
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,157
Okay, then.

107
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:34,790
Let's do it.

108
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:46,254
Ready?

109
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,886
Turn over.

110
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,798
Is something wrong?

111
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,225
I haven't been with a woman
in a long time.

112
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,647
Oh.

113
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:46,486
Wow.

114
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:57,581
I'm sorry.

115
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,107
Nobody kisses us.

116
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,344
"Pepper."

117
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:43,162
Okay, Henderson, what's up?

118
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,039
These two Krishnas have been working
the airport for a couple of months.

119
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,709
Now they'd been warned
about bugging the passengers.

120
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:51,620
- Should've listened.
- Yeah.

121
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,880
How was he killed?

122
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,299
He fucked with some guy
wearing a suede leather sport coat.

123
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,011
So the guy takes his finger,
bends it back, breaks it, then disappears.

124
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,556
Now the witness lady says
she thinks that, uh...

125
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:04,350
well, he hopped on one
of the hotel courtesy vans.

126
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,768
We got a partial description.

127
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,227
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

128
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,855
The Krishna died of a broken finger?

129
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:12,432
I mean, is that a homicide?

130
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,491
Well, I guess he died of shock.

131
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,745
Well, it hurts like hell
to have your finger bent back.

132
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,701
My sister used to do it
to me when I was a kid.

133
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,201
Yeah, but you didn't die.

134
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,245
Now, if this was an accident...

135
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,630
it'd be simple assault, right?

136
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:34,462
However... if the guy
in the suede sport coat

137
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:37,633
knew that Krishnas
had a bad habit of dying

138
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:39,969
every time you bent their finger back...

139
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,148
- Murder one?
- Yeah.

140
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:48,936
Boy, the guys at the station
are going to laugh their asses off.

141
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,105
Yeah.

142
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,898
Your turn to notify next of kin.

143
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,484
No way!
I did the fat lady that sat on a kid.

144
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:59,028
- That's good for two.
- Next week?

145
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,157
I'll be retired by then.

146
00:14:01,856 --> 00:14:03,761
Shit.

147
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,370
Well, you try the hotels.

148
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:11,250
See if anyone got off one of their
courtesy vans wearing a suede sport coat.

149
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,091
Ah, shit.

150
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:21,267
This is good here.

151
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:41,514
Oh, excuse me.

152
00:15:57,038 --> 00:16:00,365
- Maybe we should try in here.
- All right, all right.

153
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,501
Price check. Uzi squirt gun.

154
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,299
Disregard.

155
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,390
What's up?

156
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:18,686
In the bag. In the bag. Now!

157
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,065
Against the wall. Against the wall. Now!

158
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:23,031
Be cool. Be cool. Be cool, brother.

159
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,073
Hey, he's got a gun!

160
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,289
Let's get out of here! Move it!

161
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,344
Give me a day's notice
before it runs out, okay?

162
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,261
Wednesday.

163
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,230
Tell me Tuesday.

164
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,855
Looky, looky, looky.

165
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:05,192
We got a million dollars.

166
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:10,413
We got a million... Brazilian dollars.

167
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,374
Absolutely worthless.

168
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:16,626
That's a lot of money, man.

169
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:20,172
That's a lot of fucking money.

170
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:26,721
I don't think you are
a Porsche customer...

171
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,008
Mr. Frenger.

172
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,976
I don't think you really
want to buy a Porsche.

173
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,305
Do you want to buy a Porsche?

174
00:18:35,404 --> 00:18:38,231
No, man! I'm here to waste my time.

175
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:44,647
How much for the speedboat, man?

176
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:49,153
Oh, the speedboat
is very expensive, sir.

177
00:18:49,252 --> 00:18:53,413
That speedboat is $50,000.

178
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,368
Wrap it up, man.

179
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,663
Yeah, the bellman said
some guy matching the description

180
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:02,875
got off a courtesy van,
registered, yeah.

181
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:04,334
Got a name?

182
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:06,961
Name was, uh... Herman Gotlieb.

183
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:10,465
Yeah. I'm in the room right now.

184
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,884
Coat's here, too.

185
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,094
Coat? What else?

186
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:17,931
Well, the bellman also said
the guy had a hooker with him, yeah.

187
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,558
- No lie?
- I got an address on her.

188
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,102
- An address?
- Right.

189
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:23,561
Oh, man.

190
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,190
Got a pen handy there, Hoke?

191
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,075
Give me the hooker's address.

192
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:52,263
- Hi!
- Hey.

193
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:58,555
You showed up. I brought you a present.

194
00:19:58,654 --> 00:20:01,190
Oh, really? I got you one, too.

195
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,060
A present from a client.

196
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,987
Well, hey, I'm more than a client.

197
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:11,484
"Shit happens when you party naked!"

198
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,903
Look at us.

199
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:14,613
I was just gonna get you
the plain "Shit happens,"

200
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:17,156
but I thought you'd like
the "party naked" part.

201
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,959
Hey, that's the best part.

202
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:25,207
Hi. Um... circe salad, Noira.
It's real good, Junior.

203
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,666
Two.

204
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,134
Right away.

205
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:32,680
So, uh... Susie...

206
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:36,050
tell me how you wound up
living in Miami.

207
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,262
Oh, I got a job
at a Burger World up in Hollywood

208
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,013
and I was gonna, you know

209
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,557
save up and get my own franchise

210
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:46,103
but Pablo offered me this job.

211
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:49,105
Well, it pays a whole lot better.

212
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:51,107
This is a nice cup, Junior.

213
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,109
I'm gonna get a lot of use out of this.

214
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,112
It's a good cup.

215
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:57,114
Hey, did you see the swimmers?

216
00:20:57,213 --> 00:20:59,115
That's why I picked this place.

217
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:01,117
They do, like, a water ballet.

218
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,494
Ballet in the water. I like it.

219
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,997
'Cause I like to swim myself.

220
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,623
I'd rather do that kind
of work, you know?

221
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,125
But you gotta train for a long time.

222
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:11,127
So now I want to take
a Spanish course in college.

223
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,755
You know, in my business,
a lot of people don't speak English.

224
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,133
So I think I'd be better at it if I spoke...
thank you.

225
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:18,844
- We'll take a check now.
- Yes, sir.

226
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:20,679
You know, like, well, Cuban, also.

227
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:24,440
And I think that's sort of like Spanish,
Cuban, but it's a little different.

228
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:32,448
This ice cream dressing is sour as shit.

229
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,237
It's yogurt dressing, not ice cream.

230
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:38,654
Where you been?

231
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,616
Oh, that's okay.

232
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,744
I never had yogurt dressing
up in Okeechobee.

233
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,163
Where is that?

234
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:49,916
That's where I'm from.
You heard of Lake Okeechobee.

235
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,252
I'm from California.
I don't know shit about Florida.

236
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,172
You ever heard of Lake Tahoe?

237
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:56,798
Lake Tahoe?

238
00:21:56,897 --> 00:22:00,726
- How is it?
- Lousy.

239
00:22:02,695 --> 00:22:05,182
- Who is he?
- We're engaged.

240
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:06,933
Hey, separate checks.

241
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,978
- My treat.
- Good luck.

242
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:13,321
Hey, Susie we're not gonna be
calling it a night, are we?

243
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,611
I got a homework paper.
I gotta write a haiku for English class.

244
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,488
I tell you what.

245
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:22,365
I'm real good at making up things,
you know, poems.

246
00:22:22,465 --> 00:22:24,867
I could come over.
I could help you write your, uh...

247
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:28,538
- Haiku?
- Definitely.

248
00:22:28,637 --> 00:22:30,207
Okay.

249
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,465
Let's get out of here.

250
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:41,550
Thank you. I'm sorry. I liked the food.

251
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,018
Bye.

252
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:47,522
So you think this unidentified
assailant who broke, uh...

253
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:52,528
Ravindra's finger did it on purpose?

254
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,203
Sorry, uh... Ramba.

255
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,499
That's all right.

256
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,072
That was a short engagement.

257
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:06,303
Hey, you know, you still
haven't told me what it is you do.

258
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,561
Oh, I got investments.

259
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,691
I take people's money
and put it to work.

260
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:15,653
You got any?

261
00:24:19,915 --> 00:24:22,361
I got a $10,000 CD

262
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,163
and I take the interest from that,
and I put it into a N.O.W. account.

263
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:29,951
Jesus Christ.

264
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,496
That's the biggest
frigging racket going.

265
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,498
I want you to march straight down

266
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:36,375
to the bank first thing in the morning

267
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,335
and cash in both of those things.

268
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:43,096
I can't let my fiancee get ripped-off
when I can double your money.

269
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:47,017
- Double?
- Yeah.

270
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:52,397
Hey. Hey.

271
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:58,695
How 'bout that poem we were gonna write?

272
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,575
Okay.

273
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,124
We make love a lot.

274
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:16,080
We make love right now.

275
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,423
No, it's seven in the second line.

276
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:23,136
- Seven in the second line?
- Uh-huh.

277
00:25:26,982 --> 00:25:30,804
Splashes around... in his pond

278
00:25:30,903 --> 00:25:33,105
Could you close the door, please?

279
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:48,077
Thinking... he's...

280
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,296
alone.

281
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,307
Breaking... entering...

282
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:15,396
the dark... and lonely place... places.

283
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,406
Finding a...

284
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,743
big gun.

285
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,117
Yeah.

286
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,711
Smelling like a rose.

287
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,103
- Any luck?
- I wrote two.

288
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:04,480
Wow, maybe I'll get extra credit.

289
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,650
Hey, where'd you get these?

290
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,362
Dumb question. Are you a nosy rosy?

291
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,773
What the hell was that, man?

292
00:27:13,874 --> 00:27:16,116
The doorbell.

293
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,085
Talk about dumb questions.

294
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,958
- Yes?
- Susan Waggoner?

295
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:24,633
- Uh-huh.
- Can I come in?

296
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,173
I bet you're Herman Gotlieb.

297
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:32,473
How much?

298
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,471
Sergeant Hoke Moseley. Homicide.

299
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,640
Herman Gotlieb.

300
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,433
I'd like to ask you
a few questions. Routine.

301
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,519
Boy, you got a grip there, Herman.

302
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:45,689
Been working out?

303
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:48,232
Can I get you a cold one there, Sarge?

304
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,950
Well, why not?

305
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,077
Two Polars, honey.

306
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,920
You down at the airport today, Herman?

307
00:28:03,222 --> 00:28:05,541
Yeah, I was.

308
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,545
Somebody broke the finger
off a Hare Krishna

309
00:28:08,644 --> 00:28:10,588
and the son of a bitch died.

310
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,548
No shit?

311
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:14,473
No shit.

312
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,478
I didn't do it.

313
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,432
Oh, no, no, no,
we're just looking for someone

314
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,643
who might have seen anything.

315
00:28:23,742 --> 00:28:27,278
I'm curious, uh...
you own a suede sport coat?

316
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,191
Yeah, I do.

317
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,443
Okay. You're probably the one.

318
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,738
Did you get on the courtesy van
to the Grand Prix Hotel?

319
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:37,788
Hey, fuck this nonsense, man.

320
00:28:38,674 --> 00:28:40,993
Hey, you're misunderstanding this,
Herman.

321
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,578
Who got killed?

322
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,374
You know, if I had something better to do
like sit at home with a beautiful girl

323
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:48,585
I wouldn't even be
bothering you, but, uh...

324
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:51,128
you were mentioned
as a possible witness.

325
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,262
See anything?

326
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:55,515
Nope.

327
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:10,249
We got this forensic dentist.

328
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,942
And I, uh... I talked him
into pulling my teeth

329
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,653
and fixing me some new choppers.

330
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:16,904
It took two months of his spare time.

331
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,247
And I got so used to drinking
without 'em, I just pull 'em out.

332
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,250
Bother you?

333
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,005
Junior?

334
00:29:29,057 --> 00:29:30,759
You want me to fix those pork chops now?

335
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,306
Hell, I'll put 'em
back in for pork chops.

336
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,058
Pork chops comin' up.

337
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:46,983
Herman?

338
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:52,279
Your fiancee
is the best cook in South Florida.

339
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,950
More taters?

340
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:02,289
Junior?

341
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,385
So, Herman, where'd you do your time?

342
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:20,599
Time? What do you mean?

343
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,513
Well, the way you're guarding that food.

344
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,231
You know, like another con
could take it away from you.

345
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,028
Well, I was raised
in foster homes, you know?

346
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,282
I didn't get no dessert
till I was in eighth grade.

347
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,362
Damn.

348
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:41,203
I got a daughter in the eighth grade.

349
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:46,161
Half my paycheck goes
to her orthodontist.

350
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,127
She's got your teeth, man.

351
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,213
Yeah, the joint's about the only place

352
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,807
you got time to work out
to get a grip like that.

353
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,183
I was an aerobics instructor.

354
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,027
Shoots the shit out of that theory.

355
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:23,323
Any more Polars?

356
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,576
Oh... Junior got the last one.

357
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:28,501
I could run out and get some.

358
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:33,833
Beer's gone, I'm gone.

359
00:31:33,932 --> 00:31:35,424
Aw, you're kidding.

360
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,388
But, you know,
I gotta get that pork chop recipe first.

361
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:45,677
No. Are you serious?

362
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,056
It is so easy, what I did.

363
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:49,723
You are definitely
not gonna have to write this down.

364
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:53,811
All it is is pork chops in a frying pan.

365
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,189
And just cook 'em
in their own fat with a lot of salt.

366
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:58,698
Oh, well, they sure were good,
but you know what I really like...

367
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,820
is native Florida cooking.

368
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,280
Now, did you ever have
chestnut batter on your pork chops?

369
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,825
Boy, I never did.

370
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,160
You got a recipe for that somewhere?

371
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:10,702
Uh... yeah, I do, as a matter of fact.

372
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,497
I'll give it to you. Just a minute here.

373
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:14,164
Oh, I appreciate that.

374
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,632
Great dinner.

375
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,595
Get you something to go, Sarge?

376
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:23,590
Just you.

377
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,057
Kidding, Herman.

378
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,013
Listen, if you think of anything,
just, uh... give me a call.

379
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,480
That's my home phone.

380
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,186
Look, it's a hotel,
and the old guy at the desk is deaf,

381
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,190
so, uh... just let it ring
till he sees the lights.

382
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:42,734
Oh, and, uh... when we round up
the usual airport hoodlums,

383
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:46,865
maybe you could shoot by
and take a look at a line-up.

384
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,330
Take you five minutes.

385
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,721
Oh, yeah.

386
00:32:53,822 --> 00:32:58,375
You mind standing in the line-up, too?
We're a little short of bodies.

387
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,926
You ever stood
in a line-up before, Herman?

388
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:04,883
Never been caught, Sarge.

389
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,430
Ah, you ain't got one beer rat-holed

390
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:12,097
I can take with me for the road, do you?

391
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,941
You got it all, man. Dog biscuits, too.

392
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,568
See you.

393
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,740
Night, Susie.

394
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:34,347
Years ago, I started
preaching catch-and-release.

395
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,641
Back then, a lot of things
seemed to indicate

396
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,393
that our bass resource
in many areas of the country

397
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,436
was rapidly diminishing.

398
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,856
Today, there is no doubt about it,

399
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,358
and I'm very concerned
about what the future holds

400
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:48,068
for this great sport.

401
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:52,155
In simple terms we don't have
the vast water we once had

402
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:55,534
and there are several reasons for it...
pollution, illegal netting,

403
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,121
the pressure of removing
too many adult bass

404
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,539
from their environment.

405
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,380
You know, they're kind
of like money in the bank.

406
00:35:09,356 --> 00:35:14,219
I got news for you.
I'm not coming back. I'm married.

407
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,480
I am so married. I gotta go. Bye.

408
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:21,860
You like ham and eggs?

409
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,612
Hey! Drop it.

410
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,369
Smells good.

411
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:36,708
- Who was that, anyway?
- Pablo. The cops rousted him.

412
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:41,628
I guess they're giving him
a hard time because of you.

413
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,635
We got to go for a little ride, honey.

414
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:59,014
What? What about breakfast?
It was gonna be a surprise.

415
00:35:59,114 --> 00:36:01,940
I was gonna bring it
in to you on a tray, and then I...

416
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,070
Make it to go.

417
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,074
Okay.

418
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:04,438
Not too tired for some fun?

419
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,150
Call it a night, sister.

420
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,617
Aye, aye, sir.

421
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,668
I got something that I gotta tell you.

422
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,795
I used to be in prison.

423
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,798
What'd you do to get there?

424
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:18,596
I used to rob people who robbed people.

425
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:21,967
Kind of like Robin Hood?

426
00:39:22,744 --> 00:39:23,943
Yeah.

427
00:39:25,987 --> 00:39:28,856
Except I didn't give the money
to the poor people.

428
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,103
Oh.

429
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:35,195
You don't do that anymore, do you?

430
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,485
I got investments now.

431
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:43,530
Good. You got me out of the life.

432
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,657
Now you stay out of crime.

433
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:47,742
Sounds good.

434
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:49,210
Promise?

435
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:53,791
Yeah, sure. Why not?

436
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,925
Say you promise.

437
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,440
I promise.

438
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,112
Henderson? Sanchez. Homicide.

439
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,197
- Oh, my replacement.
- How is he?

440
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:24,237
He's got a cervical disc injury,
a dislocated jaw, bruises,

441
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,248
uh... got a concussion,
I don't know how bad it is.

442
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:30,452
Somebody really worked him over.

443
00:40:30,552 --> 00:40:32,663
Did he tell you who did it?
What happened?

444
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:34,963
No, he's in and out of consciousness.

445
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:52,974
Drop the knife, Pablo.

446
00:40:53,074 --> 00:40:54,976
My name isn't Gotlieb.

447
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,271
Sergeant Hoke Moseley, homicide.

448
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,356
That little girl you sent up to my room?

449
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:01,317
She's 15 years old, man.

450
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:04,778
She's 23, man. She's not 15.

451
00:41:04,878 --> 00:41:08,365
Look. Sergeant Lackley checked her I.D.

452
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:10,992
Why don't you call him?
I pay him every week.

453
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:12,827
Maybe you two guys can get together.

454
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:14,579
How much you pay Lackley every week?

455
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,373
$500 a week. Don't.

456
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,166
All right, from now on,
Lackley gets 250.

457
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:21,336
The other 250 to me at the Primrose Hotel.
You got it, man?

458
00:41:21,436 --> 00:41:24,590
Lackley's not gonna go
for any split like that.

459
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,974
You tell the guy at the desk
to leave it for me in the safe.

460
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,907
Hi. What can I get for you?

461
00:41:51,407 --> 00:41:53,547
- Ice coffee.
- Okay.

462
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,422
Hey! What are you doing?

463
00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:03,552
Open it!
Open the goddamn drawer now! Do it!

464
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,556
Stop or I'll shoot!

465
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,927
You just shot me.

466
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:13,179
I fired a warning shot, and it hit you.

467
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,981
You're no cop.

468
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:19,103
No problem. There is no problem.

469
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:21,813
Police. Homicide.
You people go about your business.

470
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,442
You finish your lunches,
your breakfasts, whatever.

471
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:26,985
Don't worry, lady,
I'm gonna call an ambulance now

472
00:42:27,085 --> 00:42:29,202
on the radio in my police car.

473
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,373
Yeah. I'll be right back.

474
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,963
Slow down.

475
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:46,596
Go ahead.

476
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,978
Stop right here!

477
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,708
- Furnished?
- Yeah, with almost antiques.

478
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:27,677
How much?

479
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,021
I been worried sick!
Where you been all day?!

480
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,155
Dumb question.

481
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,193
Did you get the money?

482
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,532
I cashed in the $10,000 CD,
but I decided to keep

483
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,248
the N.O.W. account open
for eight more days.

484
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:02,213
What did I tell you? Huh?

485
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,960
They said if I keep it
open for eight more days,

486
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:08,135
I'll be eligible for a teapot.

487
00:44:16,277 --> 00:44:17,686
I'm sorry.

488
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:24,025
It's just 8 more days.
You'll still be here, won't you?

489
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:26,278
I don't know.

490
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:31,360
My problem is that I can have everything
and anything that I want

491
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,661
but I don't know what I want.

492
00:44:38,132 --> 00:44:40,710
Tell me again about
that Burger World franchise.

493
00:44:41,552 --> 00:44:42,920
Okay.

494
00:44:50,186 --> 00:44:53,257
Okay. You need $50,000.

495
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:55,509
You borrow another 50,000
from Burger World

496
00:44:55,608 --> 00:44:57,719
and you wait for an opening.

497
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,103
But why? What's the purpose?

498
00:45:04,742 --> 00:45:07,021
To make a living, that's all.

499
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,606
You hire kids
so you can pay 'em nothing.

500
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,900
And you watch 'em real close
or they will steal you blind.

501
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,905
And... and you save your money,
and you buy a nice little house

502
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,373
with a white picket fence.

503
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,795
And you live happily ever after.

504
00:45:26,764 --> 00:45:30,168
I tell you what... let's go straight

505
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:32,510
to the "happily ever after" part, okay?

506
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,134
I can't see any point in hanging out
at a Burger World

507
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:39,559
no matter how much money
you're gonna make.

508
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,639
It's stupid.

509
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,643
You can forget
about Burger World, honey.

510
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:48,402
Okay.

511
00:45:59,922 --> 00:46:03,452
I'm gonna take care of you,
and you're gonna take care of me.

512
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,001
That's our purpose.

513
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,922
Do you know any married people today?

514
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,668
Hmm? They're a team.

515
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:15,179
They pull together, and they get rich.

516
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,806
They got it all.

517
00:46:22,653 --> 00:46:24,480
And you know that little house
you were just talking about?

518
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:30,186
I rented us one in Coral Gables today.

519
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:32,398
Oh, Junior.

520
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,239
That's what you were up to all day?

521
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,704
I'm gonna take such good care of you.

522
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:52,048
He was a big guy, man. Bigger than you.

523
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:54,885
Got up from the table,
said he was homicide.

524
00:46:55,728 --> 00:46:57,588
Pulled a badge?

525
00:46:57,688 --> 00:46:59,590
After he whacks the dude.

526
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,893
It was cold, man, ice cold.

527
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,932
Thanks, Blink.

528
00:47:08,032 --> 00:47:10,018
What do I owe you?

529
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:11,777
It's on the house, bro.

530
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,202
Come on.

531
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:46,949
I like the air conditioning on "frozen."

532
00:48:47,048 --> 00:48:48,414
Me, too.

533
00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:08,936
- Half-ounce. Primo, man.
- Thanks, man.

534
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:25,487
Hey, half that's mine.

535
00:49:25,586 --> 00:49:27,364
Fuck you! I sold it. I keep the money.

536
00:49:27,463 --> 00:49:29,032
These are my contacts.
They're my people.

537
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,617
I don't give a shit about your contacts.

538
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,494
Don't turn your back
when I'm talkin' to you.

539
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,911
I'm tired of your shit.
Get out of my face!

540
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,753
Police! Freeze!

541
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:39,041
Stand over there.

542
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:41,510
Put that on. Right through there.

543
00:49:44,188 --> 00:49:46,717
You know what to do, Shorty.

544
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,601
- Hey!
- I don't believe this.

545
00:49:57,952 --> 00:50:02,447
I'm gonna let you two guys go...
with a little warning.

546
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,284
- Don't get caught.
- Shit!

547
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,208
Police! Don't move!

548
00:50:22,476 --> 00:50:23,885
You can go now.

549
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,983
Give me your wallet!

550
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,945
Come on, man. Move it

551
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,155
Police! Drop it!

552
00:50:44,206 --> 00:50:45,657
I said drop it.

553
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,286
Shoot him!

554
00:50:51,172 --> 00:50:53,867
Make it, Julio. Comprendo?

555
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,376
Yeah. Yeah.

556
00:51:03,184 --> 00:51:05,260
That's my purse! Stop him!

557
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,764
Stop! Somebody please help me!

558
00:51:10,733 --> 00:51:12,643
Go get him.

559
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,764
Thank you, officer.

560
00:51:16,864 --> 00:51:18,224
Yeah, that's great, lady.

561
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:20,184
But... you're a cop!

562
00:51:20,284 --> 00:51:23,487
Hey! Police! Police!

563
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,907
You have anything against broccoli,
cauliflower, stuff like that?

564
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,583
I don't want to talk
about that at this time.

565
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:39,621
Oh.

566
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:43,041
What are you going to do
now that we're married?

567
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:47,385
Take care of the house,
shop, fix dinner.

568
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,724
Take care of the babies.

569
00:51:54,193 --> 00:51:56,012
Is that what you'd like to do?

570
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:58,271
Be a mother?

571
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,940
Well, I don't...

572
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,820
I guess so.
I... I don't... I don't know.

573
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:10,652
I lived with a girl once for 2 months.

574
00:52:10,751 --> 00:52:13,411
She didn't do anything a housewife
was supposed to do.

575
00:52:14,255 --> 00:52:15,621
I thought you said you were married.

576
00:52:17,007 --> 00:52:18,916
I told you that before
I really knew you.

577
00:52:21,262 --> 00:52:25,132
What I'm driving at, Susie,
is I want to have a regular life.

578
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:29,086
I want to go to work in the morning,

579
00:52:29,186 --> 00:52:33,925
sometimes at night, come home
to a clean house and a hot meal

580
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:36,351
and a loving wife just like you.

581
00:52:41,115 --> 00:52:43,108
I don't want to have any babies.

582
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,320
This world's a shit hole.

583
00:52:49,456 --> 00:52:51,657
You think you can handle that?

584
00:52:54,713 --> 00:53:00,833
I do.

585
00:53:38,422 --> 00:53:40,873
It's better than counting money.

586
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,190
These yours?

587
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,159
I can't tell.

588
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:21,664
Yeah. This, uh... nail polish.

589
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,744
We found two muscle heads
cuffed together.

590
00:54:25,844 --> 00:54:27,831
Jesus! He's making arrests?

591
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,498
We did some routine prints.

592
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,041
They match those taken

593
00:54:31,141 --> 00:54:33,503
from the scene of the dumbbell murders.

594
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:37,465
I've been working
that case for 15 months.

595
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,557
Congratulations. Case is closed.

596
00:54:41,068 --> 00:54:42,811
Find Gotlieb?

597
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,014
We're looking for him.

598
00:54:46,733 --> 00:54:48,643
Let's get the fuck out of here.

599
00:54:48,742 --> 00:54:50,686
- Okay.
- I'll find him.

600
00:54:50,786 --> 00:54:52,364
Yeah, maybe you should wait
and let him solve

601
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:55,123
a couple more from your case load, huh?

602
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:58,903
Will you have a seat, please?

603
00:54:59,003 --> 00:55:02,114
- Where, here?
- Your name, please?

604
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,117
Ziffel. Fred Ziffel.

605
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,036
Is that the way you want
the account to read?

606
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:08,288
No. I want it to read "Arnold Ziffel."

607
00:55:08,387 --> 00:55:09,795
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

608
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,876
Hey, Eddie.

609
00:55:13,976 --> 00:55:15,461
Here's the key to your new suite.

610
00:55:15,561 --> 00:55:19,806
Oh, and some Cuban kid
on a bicycle made two deliveries.

611
00:55:22,943 --> 00:55:25,262
Uh... 250 in both.

612
00:55:25,362 --> 00:55:27,056
I'm sorry. I opened them.

613
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,483
It's okay, Eddie.

614
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,862
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

615
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:57,052
- Who is it?
- Lackley. Vice.

616
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,673
Slide your I.D. under the door.

617
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:03,175
- Are you fucking serious?
- Try me!

618
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:05,726
Next thing you hear will be a bullet
coming through the door!

619
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,248
Pablo sent this.

620
00:56:33,347 --> 00:56:35,625
- What?
- What's the matter, Sarge?

621
00:56:35,724 --> 00:56:37,751
Got a guilty conscience?

622
00:56:37,851 --> 00:56:40,797
I just got out of the hospital.

623
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:43,264
I know. I know all about you.

624
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:47,137
I like your place here, too.
It's very nice.

625
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,514
You also got a little something
that belongs to me, don't you, Gums?

626
00:56:50,614 --> 00:56:53,851
What the fuck you talking about?
Never seen you before in my life.

627
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:58,106
Now, listen, Sarge you think
you're moving in on my territory?

628
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,567
I think you better cough up
some "do-re-mi" right now.

629
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:02,402
500 bucks. Let's have it.

630
00:57:03,237 --> 00:57:05,655
What 500 bucks?
What are you talking about?

631
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,032
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off?! Fuck off?!

632
00:57:08,132 --> 00:57:10,994
You go to Pablo,
you cut yourself in on my action.

633
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,710
You don't think I'm coming after you?

634
00:57:13,554 --> 00:57:16,088
Jesus Christ! You got a lot of balls!

635
00:57:21,311 --> 00:57:23,590
And Pablo wants the hooker
back on the job

636
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,342
tomorrow at 10:00,
and all is forgiven, Gums.

637
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,976
What hooker?

638
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,855
10:00.

639
00:57:34,324 --> 00:57:37,771
He got your gun and your badge...

640
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,655
and your teeth?

641
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,284
You are a disgrace to the police force.

642
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,507
Fucking Junior "Bullshit" Gotlieb.

643
00:58:14,364 --> 00:58:17,559
- Hey, you got a piece, Eddie?
- Teeth?

644
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:21,655
- No. A gun. A gun. I need it.
- Hold on.

645
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:37,713
Hair trigger.

646
00:58:38,847 --> 00:58:40,215
Hollow points.

647
00:58:43,268 --> 00:58:44,635
Thanks, Eddie.

648
00:59:44,204 --> 00:59:46,364
Where's Antonio?

649
01:00:09,896 --> 01:00:11,556
On your feet, pal.

650
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,393
Turn around.

651
01:00:17,237 --> 01:00:18,646
Move it!

652
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:24,896
Police raid! Everybody freeze!

653
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,313
Run for it!

654
01:00:26,813 --> 01:00:28,023
Yo! Hey, guys!

655
01:00:28,123 --> 01:00:31,693
Come on back. Where are you goin'?
Come on. I got this covered!

656
01:00:31,793 --> 01:00:33,112
At ease, officer.

657
01:00:33,211 --> 01:00:36,039
I think you'd better
check with your superiors.

658
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,708
Remain silent.

659
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,422
Hey, I pay good money
to the right people, huh?

660
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:52,422
Were you out at the airport today?

661
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:55,641
Was I out at the airport today?
What, are you crazy?

662
01:00:56,485 --> 01:00:59,931
- You ever stood in a line-up before?
- Oh, yeah. I stood in a line-up before.

663
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,391
Okay, I want you to line up there!

664
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:03,059
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

665
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,525
Shut up!!

666
01:01:09,715 --> 01:01:12,086
You own a suede sports coat?

667
01:01:12,876 --> 01:01:14,244
Courtesy van?

668
01:01:15,128 --> 01:01:17,030
You ain't no cop.

669
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,615
Oh, I'm a cop.

670
01:01:18,715 --> 01:01:20,159
Prove it, slick.

671
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,168
You're not walking... agh!

672
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:28,418
You crazy son of a bitch!

673
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,925
I'll kick the living shit...

674
01:01:32,521 --> 01:01:34,139
Hey, Scanlan.

675
01:01:36,858 --> 01:01:38,226
Hey.

676
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,563
Hey, Smiley. How are you?

677
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:45,643
Ellita Sanchez?

678
01:01:45,742 --> 01:01:48,103
Hoke Moseley.

679
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,521
I've been calling you.

680
01:01:49,621 --> 01:01:51,565
Don't they have someone
at that desk to answer?

681
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:56,119
Yeah. But he's deaf. Got something?

682
01:01:58,255 --> 01:02:00,456
Prints I.D. on those beer bottles.

683
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,713
That's the son of a bitch!

684
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:15,590
"Frederick J. Frenger, Junior."

685
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,050
Junior Gotlieb.
I knew that was bullshit.

686
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,677
I got something on the real Gotlieb.

687
01:02:20,777 --> 01:02:23,889
Mugged, DOA at
the San Francisco Airport Hospital.

688
01:02:23,989 --> 01:02:26,059
Sound like Junior's MO?

689
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,476
Murder one.

690
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,063
We can nail him as
the Krishna finger killer, I bet.

691
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:33,394
He's grown up behind bars.

692
01:02:33,494 --> 01:02:35,233
And look at this.

693
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:37,402
Someone charged a suede sport coat

694
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:40,789
on the real Gotlieb's credit card
after he was dead.

695
01:02:42,507 --> 01:02:44,534
We got the motherfucker!

696
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:46,210
Thanks.

697
01:02:47,304 --> 01:02:49,123
I'm sorry. Habit.

698
01:02:49,222 --> 01:02:52,001
I ran his real name by the utilities,
but it turned up nothing.

699
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,670
He wouldn't use his real name.

700
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:56,255
Well, if he did, we'd be knocking
on his door right now.

701
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,715
What about Waggoner?

702
01:02:57,815 --> 01:03:01,010
I called every utility in Dade.
Even bottled water.

703
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,644
I'm sitting here having my lunch
waiting for a call back, okay?

704
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,855
Sitting on your lunch?

705
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,943
Try Broward.

706
01:03:19,085 --> 01:03:22,322
Look, I know you think
I'm a weak suck, but I don't care.

707
01:03:22,422 --> 01:03:25,617
The guy who did this to me,
this Frenger, Junior,

708
01:03:25,717 --> 01:03:28,454
he's got my old badge, Sanchez.

709
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,880
He's running around playing cop
assaulting and beating people.

710
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,675
I'm doing everything I can to help.

711
01:03:38,188 --> 01:03:39,847
Call me if you hear anything.

712
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:22,974
Put the funny book down!

713
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:26,769
Give me the fuckin' cash
or I'll blow your fuckin' head off!

714
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,434
Come on, don't count it, God damn it!

715
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:35,027
Police! Drop the gun, son.

716
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:40,282
I know what it's like to be
on the other end of that gun.

717
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:43,952
You're making a big mistake.

718
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,907
I tell you what.

719
01:04:47,007 --> 01:04:53,295
You put down the gun, give back the money
and I'll let you walk on out of here.

720
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,469
You walk out that door
your life is gonna change forever.

721
01:05:06,693 --> 01:05:08,686
Hold your fire, you asshole!

722
01:05:14,117 --> 01:05:15,985
What the fuck?!

723
01:05:36,181 --> 01:05:37,916
Hey.

724
01:05:38,016 --> 01:05:41,177
Hey, you okay? Hey, mister.

725
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:46,014
Get this thing off me. I'm a cop.

726
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,646
I think I hit him.

727
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,697
You didn't hit shit.

728
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,653
Where is the whipping cream?

729
01:06:06,753 --> 01:06:08,246
We're out.

730
01:06:26,773 --> 01:06:28,141
Oh, my God.

731
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:31,721
Okay, I want you to do something for me.

732
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,681
Go get me some cotton balls... aah!

733
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,148
Some peroxide...

734
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,777
some bandages,
and bring me a small mirror!

735
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,452
Oh, God. Oh, God.

736
01:06:48,336 --> 01:06:50,947
Oh, fuck me. Okay.

737
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,454
Okay. Okay.

738
01:06:57,554 --> 01:07:00,750
I want you to go and get me
your smallest needle,

739
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:03,675
a small needle and thread it
with black thread, okay?

740
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:15,306
Here. I got it.
I got it. I got it. I got it.

741
01:07:15,405 --> 01:07:19,309
Okay. Okay. Okay.

742
01:07:19,409 --> 01:07:23,271
Oh, fuck. Oh, God. Oh, God.

743
01:07:23,371 --> 01:07:26,907
Okay, Now I tell you what...

744
01:07:27,751 --> 01:07:31,364
I want you to sew my eyebrow back on.

745
01:07:31,463 --> 01:07:32,829
Okay?

746
01:07:33,798 --> 01:07:35,659
Hey, hey! Now, come on, come on.

747
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,744
Come on. You're gonna be okay. I got it.

748
01:07:37,844 --> 01:07:39,211
I'm sorry. I'm no good at this.

749
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,965
I got it.

750
01:07:46,269 --> 01:07:48,588
What? Okay. Okay.

751
01:07:48,688 --> 01:07:51,682
I got you. I'm gonna get you a doctor.

752
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,936
Oh, no. No doctors. No... no doctors.

753
01:07:57,822 --> 01:07:59,565
I want you to get me a bottle of gin.

754
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:04,230
I nursed my husband
for 3 years before he died

755
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:06,030
but you're not going to die.

756
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:09,867
Here.

757
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:12,077
- It's gin, Junior.
- Drink it.

758
01:08:20,386 --> 01:08:22,212
We're gonna need this.

759
01:08:23,515 --> 01:08:25,501
This is going to hurt.

760
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,631
You move and you're a blind man.
Scissors.

761
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:32,222
Okay. Okay.

762
01:08:37,695 --> 01:08:40,105
Hold it. Hold it.

763
01:08:44,994 --> 01:08:47,355
You're doing real good, Junior.

764
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,399
I'm just gonna move down a bit.

765
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,786
Now we just have one more. Just hold on.

766
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,806
That'll hold you.

767
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:18,185
Your husband must have been glad to die.

768
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:23,850
Thank you.

769
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,903
Yeah, thanks.
You got a real nice touch there, lady.

770
01:09:39,257 --> 01:09:42,703
So are you gonna tell me about it?

771
01:09:42,802 --> 01:09:45,247
Yeah, I'll tell you about it.

772
01:09:45,346 --> 01:09:47,792
This straight life
that we've been living

773
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:50,252
has been giving me this
misplaced sense of security!

774
01:09:50,351 --> 01:09:54,930
I thought for one minute there I was some
kind of fuckin' solid citizen or something.

775
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:00,895
All I want to know
is what happened to you.

776
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:08,110
Some guy in a blue
Toyota pickup ran me over.

777
01:10:09,412 --> 01:10:11,488
I thought it must have been
something like that.

778
01:10:15,793 --> 01:10:18,697
An anonymous,
apparently off-duty police officer

779
01:10:18,796 --> 01:10:21,908
interrupted a robbery tonight
at a Coral Gables convenience store,

780
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:24,203
heroically confronting an armed robber

781
01:10:24,302 --> 01:10:26,579
with only bottles of spaghetti sauce.

782
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,515
The officer then left the scene of the crime

783
01:10:28,615 --> 01:10:31,884
without identifying himself.
Police speculate that it...

784
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:40,970
Yeah?!

785
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:42,811
Ellita Sanchez.

786
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,871
Come in.

787
01:11:07,595 --> 01:11:08,913
What's this?

788
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:13,091
Susan Waggoner, telephone order.
There's an address in the Gables.

789
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:17,095
The Gables.

790
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,926
- What time is it?
- It's 1:00.

791
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,845
I was going out on a date.

792
01:11:23,945 --> 01:11:25,264
I've got a relative with Southern Bell

793
01:11:25,363 --> 01:11:26,681
or we wouldn't have gotten
the number for days.

794
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,231
That's great. Thanks.

795
01:11:29,534 --> 01:11:31,068
What are you going to do?

796
01:11:32,704 --> 01:11:34,113
I'm gonna check it out.

797
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:40,744
Sanchez? Thanks.

798
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:03,092
Out of all the boys in the world

799
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:06,639
I choose you again...

800
01:12:06,738 --> 01:12:08,648
You feeling better?

801
01:12:13,828 --> 01:12:15,814
What would you like for breakfast?

802
01:12:15,913 --> 01:12:18,859
I carefully consider

803
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:22,570
every choice and then

804
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:26,115
- Out of all the boys in the world
- You're not hungry?

805
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:29,411
I'd choose you again...

806
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:32,546
Okay, well, I'm just gonna
run some errands and then I'll be back.

807
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:37,627
I'd choose you

808
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:40,713
If God gave me the chance

809
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:42,925
To do it all again...

810
01:12:43,024 --> 01:12:45,219
I love you.

811
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,603
Oh, I'd carefully consider...

812
01:14:01,686 --> 01:14:03,046
Oh, I'm sorry.

813
01:14:03,146 --> 01:14:06,925
Hey! Susan, uh... Waggoner, right?

814
01:14:07,024 --> 01:14:08,559
- Remember me?
- No, sir.

815
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,936
Hoke "Pork Chops" Moseley.

816
01:14:13,865 --> 01:14:16,185
God, what happened to you?

817
01:14:16,284 --> 01:14:18,770
Ah, some psycho jumped me,

818
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,521
almost broke my neck,

819
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,609
stole my gun, my badge, and my teeth.

820
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:26,077
- Teeth?
- Yeah. These are temps.

821
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,947
Hey, I got something for you.

822
01:14:29,046 --> 01:14:30,615
Do you do your marketing here?

823
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,283
Excuse me, would you
like to try some sausage?

824
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:34,912
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure? It's really good.

825
01:14:35,011 --> 01:14:36,378
Remember that...

826
01:14:38,055 --> 01:14:41,001
pork chop recipe I promised you

827
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,467
with the chestnut batter?

828
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:46,297
Glad I ran into you.

829
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:48,466
Oh, this is great.

830
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,301
I can't believe you remembered.

831
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:51,720
That is so nice of you.

832
01:14:51,819 --> 01:14:54,430
I'm gonna put it on my list,
and I'm gonna make it tonight.

833
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:57,483
Hey, is that an invitation?
I'll be there.

834
01:14:58,577 --> 01:14:59,944
Oh.

835
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:03,072
I got class tonight. I'm sorry.

836
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:06,902
You're still with that guy, huh?

837
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,828
No. Um... I kicked him out.

838
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:14,158
Well, good for you.

839
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:16,412
You know who he really is?

840
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:17,829
He's a murderer.

841
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:20,541
Herman Gotlieb isn't even his real name.

842
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,208
He spent his life in prison.

843
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:25,753
Frederick J. Frenger, Junior.

844
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,840
Junior.

845
01:15:27,939 --> 01:15:29,257
Yeah.

846
01:15:29,557 --> 01:15:32,261
Hate to run into Senior.

847
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:36,222
Oh... hey, you ever made vinegar pie?

848
01:15:37,274 --> 01:15:39,810
Vinegar pie? My mother used to make it.

849
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:41,395
I can still taste it.

850
01:15:41,494 --> 01:15:43,896
Oh. Seedless raisins for a start.

851
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:46,108
Chop 'em up real fine.

852
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:48,819
And you beat the egg yolks
and the butter until they're creamy

853
01:15:48,918 --> 01:15:50,445
Wait a second.

854
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,323
And you beat the egg whites
until they're stiff,

855
01:15:53,422 --> 01:15:57,743
and then you fold them in,
and you take one cup of sugar.

856
01:15:57,844 --> 01:16:00,663
And, um... here's the tricky part, okay?

857
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:02,082
This is the key.

858
01:16:02,181 --> 01:16:05,002
You use 5% vinegar, no stronger.

859
01:16:05,101 --> 01:16:07,337
And just three teaspoons, that's all.

860
01:16:07,436 --> 01:16:09,506
Just three little teaspoons.

861
01:16:09,605 --> 01:16:12,676
That's where Mama went wrong.

862
01:16:12,775 --> 01:16:15,435
Yeah, probably so.

863
01:16:16,988 --> 01:16:21,108
You don't know where I could find
that old boyfriend of yours, do you?

864
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:25,362
No. He's gone for good.

865
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,649
I know you wouldn't lie for him.

866
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,618
He was the liar.

867
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,448
Well, uh... enjoy that recipe.

868
01:16:34,547 --> 01:16:35,908
I will.

869
01:16:36,007 --> 01:16:37,373
Look, my number's on it.

870
01:16:38,217 --> 01:16:40,920
If you really like it, give me a call.

871
01:16:45,766 --> 01:16:47,384
Oh, my God.

872
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:55,266
One.

873
01:16:58,195 --> 01:16:59,563
Two.

874
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,210
Three.

875
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:45,601
What are you doing tomorrow?

876
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:47,694
I was gonna paint the security bars.

877
01:17:48,537 --> 01:17:53,025
Oh, no, I got a million errands
I gotta run tomorrow.

878
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:55,988
I wanted to go in
and cash in my coin collection.

879
01:17:56,087 --> 01:17:58,956
I need you to drive me around some.
We'll be done by noon.

880
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,284
Can't you drive?

881
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,703
Oh, no way, honey.

882
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:05,538
Honey, I gotta...

883
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:09,333
I'm gonna be hopping in and out
of a hundred different places.

884
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:12,595
Cost me a fortune just to park
if I could find a place.

885
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:16,347
That dessert?

886
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,726
I'll bring it to you. Just go sit down.

887
01:19:04,613 --> 01:19:06,564
So, you gonna drive me around tomorrow?

888
01:19:07,408 --> 01:19:09,770
Junior, are you sure
this is just an errand?

889
01:19:09,869 --> 01:19:12,112
You promised no more illegal stuff.

890
01:19:14,957 --> 01:19:18,077
You saved my life, Susie.

891
01:19:19,587 --> 01:19:22,365
Would I fuck up the best thing
that ever happened to me

892
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:25,000
just to make you
some kind of a wheelman?

893
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:28,462
Would you?

894
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:33,050
We made a deal.

895
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:36,052
I promised.

896
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:48,649
Like it?

897
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:51,819
This is really great.

898
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,573
It's great!

899
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,036
Great.

900
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:05,289
One of your best.

901
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:46,551
If a cop should come by and hassle you,
then you just drive on around the block.

902
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,886
Why would anyone hassle me?

903
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:51,180
You parked in a yellow zone.

904
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,855
Oh.

905
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:20,134
Police officer. Buzz me in.

906
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:02,752
You say these coins
are stolen, Sergeant?

907
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:05,005
Sergeant, uh

908
01:23:05,104 --> 01:23:06,590
Moseley.

909
01:23:06,689 --> 01:23:08,466
Homicide.

910
01:23:08,565 --> 01:23:10,594
We picked him up on a fencing sting.

911
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:14,270
We figure if we could get a line
on the owners, we could solve the crime.

912
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:18,143
This a valuable collection or what?

913
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:20,735
This is by no means a rare collection.

914
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:25,149
When I take

915
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:29,029
this fleeting breath

916
01:23:29,128 --> 01:23:32,698
When my eyes,

917
01:23:32,798 --> 01:23:36,251
they'll close in death

918
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:44,920
Just a cursory look at these coins

919
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,880
tells me they're in fair condition.

920
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:49,466
That was cursory?

921
01:23:49,565 --> 01:23:51,509
You ever seen them before?

922
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:54,511
Seen lots like them.

923
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:56,555
What happened to your eye?

924
01:23:56,655 --> 01:23:58,682
Car accident.

925
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:01,478
You should sue the doctor
who sewed you up.

926
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:02,895
You could make a bundle.

927
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,564
He said it'd be fine
after it scarred over.

928
01:24:05,664 --> 01:24:07,650
He lied.

929
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,487
How come a homicide detective

930
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:13,573
is so interested in stolen property?

931
01:24:13,672 --> 01:24:17,577
First of all, that's
confidential information.

932
01:24:17,676 --> 01:24:21,664
Second of all, I'll ask all
the questions around here.

933
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,541
I'm working on a tip.

934
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,668
I'm thinking of putting
a stakeout in here.

935
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:28,630
You know, before I put that window in

936
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:30,590
I was hit three times in one month,

937
01:24:30,689 --> 01:24:33,009
but I don't need no stakeout now.

938
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:34,886
Yeah? Why's that?

939
01:24:34,985 --> 01:24:37,436
Because of Pedro. Pedro!

940
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:43,185
He's been watching you the whole time

941
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:44,770
through a peephole in the door.

942
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:47,524
It's okay, Pedro.

943
01:24:47,623 --> 01:24:51,576
This is Sergeant Moseley.
He's with the police department.

944
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:57,957
Pedro!

945
01:25:03,739 --> 01:25:05,532
You bitch!

946
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,792
Oh, God.

947
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:13,777
You promised!

948
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,036
What the fuck are you doing?!

949
01:26:19,882 --> 01:26:23,835
- Freeze! Police!
- Freeze! Police!

950
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,048
Hold it!

951
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,559
Hey, move it!

952
01:26:57,127 --> 01:26:59,072
Stop! Police!

953
01:26:59,171 --> 01:27:00,956
Not again! No!

954
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,875
Get out of the car!

955
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:06,877
Shit.

956
01:28:17,582 --> 01:28:18,943
What happened to you?

957
01:28:19,042 --> 01:28:21,945
Raise your hands level
with your shoulders.

958
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:25,742
What are you gonna do if I don't, Sarge?

959
01:28:25,841 --> 01:28:27,159
Shoot me?

960
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:31,962
What was the bullshit with the money
you left me, Frederick?

961
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,880
I don't give nothing away.

962
01:28:38,979 --> 01:28:41,096
What did the Krishna do to die?

963
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:43,384
Where did you get that jacket?

964
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:45,060
Herman Gotlieb.

965
01:28:51,658 --> 01:28:53,728
Stand up. Back up slowly.

966
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:55,145
Turn around and face the wall.

967
01:28:55,246 --> 01:28:58,782
I don't think I can do that.
I'll pass out.

968
01:29:00,042 --> 01:29:01,778
Most of my fingers have been cut off,

969
01:29:01,877 --> 01:29:03,863
and I'll probably go into
shock any minute now.

970
01:29:03,962 --> 01:29:05,168
Move it!

971
01:29:11,136 --> 01:29:15,923
Everything's turning
all orange and silver.

972
01:29:41,125 --> 01:29:43,451
Susie's gonna get you, Sarge.

973
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:17,287
Did you kill him?

974
01:31:17,387 --> 01:31:18,755
Yes.

975
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:30,725
Good-bye, Junior.

976
01:31:34,404 --> 01:31:36,730
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to, but, uh...

977
01:31:37,574 --> 01:31:39,943
gotta clear a few things up.

978
01:31:43,038 --> 01:31:44,948
Did you know Junior
was gonna rob the store?

979
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,653
I was hoping he wouldn't.

980
01:31:48,752 --> 01:31:50,619
He swore to me.

981
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,824
I had to give him
the benefit of the doubt

982
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,000
because he had some good qualities.

983
01:31:57,094 --> 01:31:59,671
He always ate everything
I ever cooked for him.

984
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:03,632
And he never hit me.

985
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:10,347
There were lots of good
things about Junior.

986
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:15,720
Listen, Hoke, this is exactly what happened
or you're in big jurisdictional trouble.

987
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:18,349
You were tailing him, a murder suspect.

988
01:32:18,448 --> 01:32:21,060
You see him coming out of the coin shop
with a gun in his hand.

989
01:32:21,159 --> 01:32:22,936
Suspecting him of robbery,
you called for back-up

990
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:24,354
and you followed him to the house.

991
01:32:24,454 --> 01:32:26,399
He pulled a gun on you,
and you shot him.

992
01:32:26,498 --> 01:32:28,867
- Something like that.
- Exactly like that.

993
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,320
There's only one problem,
though... the girl.

994
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:34,448
She'll blow holes in this story.

995
01:32:34,548 --> 01:32:36,082
Cut her loose.

996
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:42,206
Is she really Princess Not-So-Bright
or is she just pretending?

997
01:32:42,305 --> 01:32:44,548
Ah, she's been through hell.
Leave her alone.

998
01:32:50,105 --> 01:32:51,890
Let's get the fuck out of here.

999
01:32:53,149 --> 01:32:54,719
You look different.

1000
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:56,595
Got my teeth back.

1001
01:33:23,805 --> 01:33:27,335
When I die and they lay me to rest

1002
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:31,296
Gonna go to the place that's the best

1003
01:33:31,396 --> 01:33:34,050
When I lay me down to die

1004
01:33:34,149 --> 01:33:38,679
Goin' up to the spirit in the sky

1005
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:42,432
- Goin' up to the spirit in the sky
- Spirit in the sky

1006
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:46,186
- It's where I'm gonna go when I die
- When I die

1007
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:49,105
When I die and they lay me to rest

1008
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:53,576
I'm gonna go
to the place that's the best

1009
01:34:08,975 --> 01:34:12,128
Prepare yourself, you know it's a must

1010
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:16,132
Gotta have a friend in Jesus

1011
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:19,595
So you know that when you die

1012
01:34:19,694 --> 01:34:23,474
He's gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky

1013
01:34:23,573 --> 01:34:27,353
Gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky

1014
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:31,189
- That's where you're gonna go when you die
- When you die

1015
01:34:31,289 --> 01:34:34,068
When you die and they lay you to rest

1016
01:34:34,167 --> 01:34:38,496
You're gonna go to the place
that's the best

1017
01:35:23,007 --> 01:35:26,703
Never been a sinner, I never sinned

1018
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:30,875
I got a friend in Jesus

1019
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:33,918
So you know that when I die

1020
01:35:34,019 --> 01:35:37,922
He's gonna set me up
with the spirit in the sky

1021
01:35:38,023 --> 01:35:41,801
- Oh, set me up with the spirit in the sky
- Spirit in the sky

1022
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:45,722
- That's where I'm gonna go when I die
- When I die

1023
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:48,475
When I die and they lay me to rest

1024
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:52,403
I'm gonna go to the place
that's the best

1025
01:35:52,454 --> 01:35:57,033
Go to the place that's the best.
