1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,810
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You are my god.

2
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,848
My inspiration, my everything.

3
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,414
He's on a different level now,
how he listens...

4
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,853
...and plays records.
I think he's very special...

5
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,652
...because no other DJ can do that.

6
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,291
I don't know what he was doing,
whether he was...

7
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,454
...honing his talents
in another direction.

8
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,725
He just disappeared
from the scene completely.

9
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,198
It was really depressing.

10
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,606
He's probably down in South America,
still hanging out.

11
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,436
Probably trying to snort up
one of the countries, or...

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,078
I don't know, he's just...

13
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,737
I like to think he's still out there.

14
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:26,116
Frankie, I'm curious. Can you tell me
about your flip-flop collection?

15
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:31,519
I'm a bit of the lmelda Marcos
of the flip-flop world.

16
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,591
Flip-flop, for me, is perfection.

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,958
And sometimes if I'm stuck
and I can't mix, I can't...

18
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,066
You know, I'm a creative person.
I'm an artist.

19
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,670
So sometimes I just stare
at a flip-flop for hours.

20
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:47,068
I'm not joking.
I'm being serious, yeah.

21
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,730
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

22
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,899
Recently, you've been married...

23
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:54,342
...so how is it now
being a husband?

24
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,641
- An "ass band"?
- Husband.

25
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:57,976
- Oh, husband.
- Husband.

26
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,517
A husband. Yeah, it's very nice.

27
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,052
It's what I've...

28
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,484
Say hello!

29
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,217
Hello, lbiza!

30
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,163
<i>DJ! DJ! DJ! DJ!</i>

31
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,717
<i>This is Pete Tong, you're listening</i>
<i>to The Essential Selection.</i>

32
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,649
<i>I'm sitting across from Frankie Wilde.</i>
<i>How are you, Frankie?</i>

33
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,083
<i>I feel like a star, man.</i>

34
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,658
<i>Eleven years.</i>
<i>Eleven years in Ibiza...</i>

35
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,986
<i>... playing some of the best clubs</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

36
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,629
- <i>How do you feel about it this year?</i>
- <i>What, mate?</i>

37
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,733
<i>It's your 11 th year, Frankie,</i>
<i>playing in Ibiza. You must be thrilled.</i>

38
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:09,564
It's been fucking hot, ain't it, here,
the last week?

39
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,573
God.

40
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,143
I mean...

41
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,471
...think about...
You're old, like me.

42
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,583
You're an old geezer.

43
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,311
You remember that martini
campaign in the '70s?

44
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,114
"Martini is"

45
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,519
Dot, dot, dot, dot.
Remember that?

46
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,027
When I was a kid,
that wow-ed me out, man, bigtime.

47
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,062
It's like, "is" what?
What the fuck is it?

48
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,064
What the fuck is martini?

49
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:39,295
But I was young,
and I didn't really understand.

50
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,999
And now I'm mature...

51
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,579
...and I've lived 38 years,
and I can confidently say:

52
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,041
"Ibiza is"

53
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,714
Dot, dot, dot, dot. You know
what I mean? And that's really nice.

54
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,515
It's really nice
to be able to feel that.

55
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,050
There's spunk everywhere
on this island.

56
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,629
Everyone's done it,
and they've been free with it.

57
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,663
They haven't done it
to make babies.

58
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,826
They've fucking swung out
and spun a bit out...

59
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,471
...and it's hit a plant,
and that's grown.

60
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,297
Wall, and there's vines
and ivy and shit.

61
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:20,105
It's all spunk. Look at this lot out here.
Look at them.

62
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,180
They all love it.
They fucking love it.

63
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,445
- Who out there likes to fucking party?
- <i>Yeah!</i>

64
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,817
I can't hear you! Who out there
likes to fucking party?

65
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,982
- Who likes to fucking party?
- <i>Yeah!</i>

66
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,870
<i>Frankie was definitely</i>
<i>one of the best.</i>

67
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,770
<i>He had his very, sort of,</i>
<i>own style...</i>

68
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,173
<i>... his very own momentum</i>
<i>with the crowd.</i>

69
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,243
No one else did it his way.

70
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,577
He's a showman
as much as he is a musician.

71
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,349
<i>He controlled the crowd</i>
<i>musically and physically.</i>

72
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,195
<i>He was a born natural</i>
<i>behind the turntable.</i>

73
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,297
<i>There's no doubt.</i>
<i>I was jealous of that.</i>

74
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,294
I always had to try a bit harder.

75
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,470
Super, super, super, <i>loco</i>.

76
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,586
<i>Frankie was cruising along,</i>
<i>doing his thing...</i>

77
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,991
<i>... getting all the attention that</i>
<i>he needed. And then he met Max.</i>

78
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:22,624
No. Hey, tell him it's like a wasp
just stung my clit, yeah.

79
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,327
I don't give a fuck if he's religious.
Tell him anyway.

80
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,530
Fuck him. Bye. Anyway...

81
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,809
A bit of a tosser.
Not my sort of person...

82
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,002
...but absolutely took him
to the next level.

83
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,515
I love you, Max!

84
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,348
<i>Max first brought Frankie</i>
<i>to my attention.</i>

85
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,620
<i>I knew he had what it took</i>
<i>behind the decks...</i>

86
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:55,825
<i>... but it turned out that Frankie really</i>
<i>understood the music production side.</i>

87
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,197
<i>You know,</i>
<i>knew his way around a studio.</i>

88
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,640
Do you think
we're making a jazz album?

89
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,540
I'm just right in the middle
of going all the fucking way.

90
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,647
Should we swap them over
for some brushes?

91
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,282
You know:

92
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,144
Start fucking hitting those drums.

93
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,086
Start banging those drums like
you bang your fucking sister!

94
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,623
Clear, Siegfried?

95
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,523
That's the first one.

96
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,435
So I signed him straightaway.

97
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,171
And Frankie delivered.

98
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,673
<i>It was massive.</i>

99
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,476
<i>Come out of car windows, in the</i>
<i>supermarket. Even my grandmother...</i>

100
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,186
...would whistle that tune when I went
to see her in the nursing home.

101
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:20,679
<i>Frankie met Sonya when they were</i>
<i>on the video shoot to "Rise Again."</i>

102
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,947
Oh, man. I mean, everybody knew
that she'd been about.

103
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,648
But he seemed to like that.
I mean, that was his thing.

104
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,284
You know, I mean,
even I'd had a go at her.

105
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,532
15-love.

106
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,109
I was thinking, you know how
Paul Newman's got...

107
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,973
...his salad dressings and that?

108
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,742
So why not Frankie Wilde hummus?

109
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,442
- That's a good idea.
- People come and see the gigs...

110
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,145
...they say,
"Fuck, that was a great set, Frankie."

111
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,518
I'll say, "Cheers, mate.
You want some hummus?"

112
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,024
- You know, just as a thing.
- Yeah.

113
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,525
Quite a good name for an album.

114
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,028
How's that?

115
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,325
Frankie Wilde, <i>Hummus.</i>

116
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,569
What, call my album <i>Hummus</i>?

117
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,727
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

118
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,499
I've got good ideas, Frankie.
You should listen to me.

119
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,542
If I've got my own hummus brand
and my album's called <i>Hummus...</i>

120
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,236
...it's getting a bit much.
- I think it's a good name.

121
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,746
Why don't I change my name
to "Frankie Hummus"?

122
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,440
No, it sounds good. Yeah.

123
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,179
<i>I think a lot of people tolerated her</i>
<i>because she was Frankie's wife.</i>

124
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,882
<i>At the end of the day, I think</i>
<i>she was partying with everyone else.</i>

125
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,721
I didn't like her. I didn't think
she was good for him.

126
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,991
- I fucking hate you.
- I fucking hate you.

127
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,497
- <i>And did I fuck her?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

128
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,795
Yeah, I fucked her.

129
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,074
Legend has it that Frank's problems
started undramatically.

130
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,542
It was the simplest thing
that kicked it off.

131
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,551
It was years and years of noise
was the basis of the problem.

132
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,987
<i>But the very beginnings of it,</i>
<i>in his life, started very plainly.</i>

133
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,184
<i>Frankie's problem was quite</i>
<i>a common problem amongst DJ's...</i>

134
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,617
<i>... an occupational hazard.</i>
<i>They work in the clubs.</i>

135
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,553
The noise just takes its toll.

136
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,092
<i>Someone like Frankie,</i>
<i>having a problem like that, I thought:</i>

137
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,961
<i>"This geezer's gonna go.</i>
<i>He's gonna lose it. "</i>

138
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,362
And he did lose it.

139
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,864
I watched him lose it,
slowly but surely.

140
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,234
Fucking come on, then!

141
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:27,248
I think we could have the Spanish
look, I like this color for the water.

142
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,860
Perhaps maybe that one, Japanese.

143
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,520
Frankie. Morning, honey.

144
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,188
Oh, Frankie!

145
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,845
Come here.
I want to ask you something.

146
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,412
- Morning.
- Morning, sweet...

147
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,750
You all right?

148
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,484
If we go for the Spanish look...

149
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,705
It's for the garden.

150
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,049
- A bit of both.
- Okay. Little bit of both.

151
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,518
- We can do that, can't we?
- Yeah.

152
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,124
Fuck! Fucking hell!

153
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,529
You all right?

154
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,401
<i>His hearing was fucked.</i>

155
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,808
<i>But he tried to keep working</i>
<i>and plow through.</i>

156
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,005
You know,
put the horse blinkers on.

157
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:02,119
Ignore the problem, and it'll go away.
You know, always works for me.

158
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:40,186
<i>Can you tell us what's happening</i>
<i>with the new album?</i>

159
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,892
<i>Have I got a spot? Have I...?</i>

160
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:46,992
- No.
- It's fine.

161
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,895
You're perfect. You're perfect.

162
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,128
Your fans are curious about
the new album. They have to know.

163
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,273
It's good. It's going really well.
It's going really well.

164
00:17:55,441 --> 00:18:00,469
Been bending the sound, sort of.
I've been forging it.

165
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,774
With a lyrical smelter.

166
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,614
Yeah.

167
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,382
- Not as beautiful as you.
- Thank you.

168
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,523
And I got these two...

169
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,595
...like, Austrian mates...

170
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,597
...who are stoking the fires.

171
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,669
Everybody should have
at least two Austrian mates.

172
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,636
Everybody should have
at least two.

173
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,866
When can we expect
the new album to come out?

174
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,374
- Soon.
- Soon?

175
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,636
Ish.

176
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,205
Can I have a word?

177
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,142
Can I have a word?

178
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,975
Yeah. It's good?

179
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,778
I took a call just before,
a couple of hours ago.

180
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:17,285
I forgot to mention it, but I need to...
I need to...

181
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:22,223
The album people,
they want the lyrics for the sleeve.

182
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,852
I just need you to write them down.
We can pop them off.

183
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,522
Get them off and we don't have
to worry about it.

184
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,565
No, no, we never write them down.

185
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,971
That's it.

186
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,409
What else did you sing after that?

187
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,646
Frankie.

188
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,715
Frank.

189
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,480
Frank!

190
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,516
What?

191
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,123
Have you got a condom?

192
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,557
- Have you got a condom?
- No, I'm not gonna fuck her.

193
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,889
I'm knackered.
I'm just gonna have a nosh.

194
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,146
<i>Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!</i>

195
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:52,105
<i>Well, denial is a river in Frank,</i>
<i>and it runs deep.</i>

196
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:57,920
<i>And his sets</i>
<i>were shambolic on times.</i>

197
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,652
Clearly, could only be the work
of a man who couldn't hear.

198
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:52,169
It wasn't pretty, but, you know,
for me...

199
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:55,108
...for someone that has gone
through something like that...

200
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,511
...to still get up there
and give it a go is a big thing.

201
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,147
<i>Off! Off! Off! Off!</i>

202
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,423
Let go, fuckers!

203
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,882
Fuckers!

204
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,232
Fucking fuckers!

205
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,182
- Because they dangle
when they're cold.

206
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:18,914
Yeah.
Now, listen very carefully, okay?

207
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,650
It's very important.
This is very important.

208
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:26,264
I have cancer, okay?
And I'm very delicate.

209
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,797
So they have to be very gentle.

210
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:31,532
- Hey, Frank.
- All right?

211
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,102
- How are you?
- All right.

212
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,795
- Attaboy.
- How you doing?

213
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,964
Good, good. Motherfucker.

214
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,475
Listen, I had that dream again.
I was sucking my own cock.

215
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,840
But this time,
I don't have a huge cock.

216
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:46,040
I have a normal-sized cock.
No spine. My spine disappears.

217
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:51,554
So my head, it just flops down
onto my... Anyway...

218
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,521
- You all right?
- Yeah. Sit down, sit down, sit down.

219
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,490
Look, I was just talking to the label...

220
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,792
...and they'd like to see
a couple of tracks.

221
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:07,067
The label would like
a couple of tracks, Frank.

222
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,865
- It's coming. It's coming.
- Yeah.

223
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:13,204
The tracks are coming, man, relax.
Don't worry, mate, it's fine.

224
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,347
- It's all right.
- I saw your show last night.

225
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,313
I tell you,
I really fucked up last night, man.

226
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:23,750
- It's my call. I picked the wrong set.
- It stunk. It stunk like shit, Frank.

227
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,187
It stunk like...
Well, like you shit your pants...

228
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,795
...and you just sat in it for a week,
and then you shit yourself again.

229
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,759
That's how fucking bad
it stunk, Frank.

230
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,065
- It was shit, yeah?
- It was shit, Frank. Yes, it was shit.

231
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,532
I tell you, the fucking monitors
at that place.

232
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,069
You know,
I'm fucking mixing my heart out.

233
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,072
I can't hear a fucking thing.
We gotta have words with them...

234
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,574
...get this sorted out,
otherwise we blow that place out.

235
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,043
- I couldn't hear a fucking thing.
- Right.

236
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,977
Because you might be deaf, Frank.

237
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,377
- What's that?
- You could be deaf, Frank.

238
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,384
- What you saying?
- You are deaf.

239
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,423
- Can't hear you, Max.
- You're fucking deaf, asshole!

240
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,152
Who the fuck you fooling, Frank?

241
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,797
You're talking like
a 95-year-old war vet.

242
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,163
Frank, you need professional help.

243
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,766
I'm thinking about getting
some professional help.

244
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,504
Yeah.

245
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,439
Yeah.

246
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,650
Fuck it.

247
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,508
Hello, Frank.

248
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,013
Come in, Frank.

249
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,749
Frank!

250
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,612
I don't want you to panic, Frank.

251
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,117
I've got some bad news
for you, though.

252
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:46,052
You're going deaf.
Completely deaf.

253
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,786
As you know, your right ear
is completely shot.

254
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:57,901
Your left ear, that's this one,
has got 20 percent left.

255
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,697
You were born
with little holes in them...

256
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,670
...and slowly the fluid pressure
is dropping.

257
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,572
Can't you just plug it up
with some ear putty or something?

258
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,272
The ear organism, it's way too
sensitive and delicate for that.

259
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,349
Surgery doesn't work.
Cochlear implant doesn't work.

260
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:17,147
You've gotta stop exposing yourself
to so much noise.

261
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:18,619
What do you mean by that?

262
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,782
It means that if you listen
to absolute silence...

263
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,986
...your ears are gonna last
a little bit longer.

264
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,030
They're crumbling as we speak.

265
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,998
Stop the drugs, Frank.
Stop the drinking.

266
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,660
Go to bed at a decent hour.

267
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,807
We can give you a hearing aid
that gives you temporary hearing...

268
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,205
...but that damages the ear
even further.

269
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:42,073
- Speak up.
- These are the facts, Frank.

270
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:45,580
These are the facts, Frank.
We can't change them.

271
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,116
You are deaf, man.

272
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,812
You are a deaf man.

273
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,551
This is costing me 2000
fucking euros an hour.

274
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,854
Chuck me a fucking bone!

275
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,156
This is your hearing aid, Frank.

276
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:04,665
Use it only when you have to.
Only when you have to.

277
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:10,065
- Only when I have to.
- Right. Only when you have to.

278
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,436
Got that? No exceptions.

279
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,711
Can you keep on gigging?

280
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,475
Frankie?

281
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,312
Can you keep on gigging?

282
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,783
Can you keep on gigging?

283
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,494
I love them both, you know?

284
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,293
I love hearing, and I love DJ'ing.

285
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,610
I was thinking this morning
maybe I should write a book.

286
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,907
That's a brilliant idea.

287
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:55,013
That might take years, though, so...

288
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,956
Perhaps, like, a pamphlet.
A sort of brochure thing.

289
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,723
Listen, Frankie, I...

290
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,361
I want to tell you that
whatever your decision...

291
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,727
...I will support it wholeheartedly.

292
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,165
You and me and little Kingie.

293
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,062
That's all that matters to me.

294
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:20,070
Deaf, dumb or blind, baby,
we will get through this.

295
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,340
It's brilliant to almost hear that.

296
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,616
<i>Fair play to the guy.</i>

297
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,810
<i>I have no idea what</i>
<i>I would have done in that situation.</i>

298
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,947
I mean, there he is.
You know, he's between a rock...

299
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,218
...and you know, another rock...

300
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,488
...which is harder and bigger.

301
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:38,844
Hi.

302
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,858
I'm actually thinking about
giving it a bit of a break.

303
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,024
Of course I fucking love you.

304
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,364
How can you say that?

305
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:58,339
I just think we don't necessarily
bring out the best in each other.

306
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,478
Not always the best thing for me.

307
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,308
It's my problem.
It's not your problem.

308
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,511
You know what I mean? Why can't we
just be mates for a little bit?

309
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:12,417
I could just give you a ring
every few weeks, you know?

310
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,720
Just make it a little bit more casual.
Couldn't we do that?

311
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,625
It sounds like the <i>caca.</i>

312
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,630
No.

313
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,837
Is Frank there?

314
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,799
Is this Frank standing
in front of me?

315
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:43,280
No, this is a drunken baboon
drooling on the mix board.

316
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,472
What in all of the heavens
are you on, Frank?

317
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,421
Are you fucking deaf
or something?

318
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,061
What's your fucking problem?

319
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,698
They would laugh you
out of Austria.

320
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,967
I can hear them laughing now.

321
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:14,166
Where is Frankie fucking Wilde,
Frankie?

322
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,145
Is he fucking gone?

323
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:20,114
And the fucking,
"Go away. Stay, stay, stay," huh?

324
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,962
So you're deaf?

325
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,965
You're deaf?

326
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,411
Almost.

327
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:55,416
This is like all the terrors
and the horrors of the world...

328
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,679
...raining down on your skull.

329
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:06,492
Last three months,
it's really rapidly accelerated.

330
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,224
But I've... I've got this.

331
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,597
And I really thought
I could do this job, man.

332
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,228
I'll show you.

333
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,135
Hello, Mr. Drum!

334
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,003
Drummer!

335
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,075
The left ear,
there's still a little bit left.

336
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,718
And this little fella
is a fucking lifeline, man.

337
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,852
But I can use it only when I have to.

338
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,624
Long as I'm careful,
I can hear more.

339
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:15,223
- What? What has happened?
- What?

340
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,096
<i>He was stone-fucking deaf.</i>

341
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:58,099
<i>There's not much you can do as a DJ</i>
<i>if you can't hear.</i>

342
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,065
Generally, the field of music...

343
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,435
...other than the obvious example...

344
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:08,203
...has been dominated
by people who can hear.

345
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,038
He was never gonna hear again.

346
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:14,878
It was as simple as that. It was...

347
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,175
...gone.

348
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,129
All right, Frankie?

349
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,165
All right?

350
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:17,971
Blink!

351
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,800
<i>Hola,</i> mate.

352
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:21,906
- All right?
- All right.

353
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,380
Good game?

354
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:29,315
- Is it a good game?
- Yeah, it's all right. It's pretty good.

355
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,920
It's decent.

356
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,359
Sonya in?

357
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:38,859
Sonya in?

358
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,657
Yeah, she's here. She's upstairs.

359
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,891
- She's packing, mate.
- She all right?

360
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,868
She's leaving you, Frank.

361
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,901
She's leaving you.

362
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,596
For me.

363
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,242
- Get in there!
- Did you see that?

364
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,006
Fucking hell!

365
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,279
Fucking, how was that one, eh?
Ter-fucking-rific!

366
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,257
- Yes, brilliant, wasn't it?
- Want a line?

367
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,688
Not right now, thanks. Cheers.

368
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,125
Frankie.

369
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,601
- You all right?
- Yeah.

370
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:37,153
I'm leaving you.

371
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,658
I'm gonna take the tiger.
That's mine.

372
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:45,056
And I want those ones,
obviously, because they're mine.

373
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:49,791
And you can have the sculpture
that your mother bought us.

374
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,567
Aren't you upset, Frankie?

375
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,573
Do you wanna say anything to me?
Anything at all?

376
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,461
Frankie!

377
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,778
Where the fuck's the album, Frank?

378
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:41,282
Where the fuck
is the album, Frank?!

379
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,886
Where the fuck is the album?!

380
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,298
It smells like shit in here, Frank.

381
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,336
What the fuck's happened to you?

382
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,373
What the fuck happened
to you, Frank?

383
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,111
I don't know what this is.
I don't know what this is.

384
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:12,076
This is bullshit, Frank. This isn't
how you take on things, huh?

385
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:14,979
Listen...

386
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:19,821
Maybe this isn't the worst thing
in the world.

387
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,514
Take some fucking time off.

388
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,752
Go in the sun for fuck's sakes, huh?

389
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,626
Eat a lot of fruit,
get some fucking vitamins in you.

390
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,996
Vegetables and greens and shit.
I can't...

391
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,965
You know, there's...
I was reading yesterday...

392
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,666
...there's a fish,
it's called a zebra fish.

393
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,435
Has little hairs on it.

394
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,672
And somehow,
they can implant that...

395
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,117
I don't know.

396
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,511
It's too fucking hot.

397
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,223
It's always too fucking hot.

398
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,523
I can't help you.

399
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,091
I don't know how to...

400
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:09,569
I don't know how to help... - I don't
want to help you. I can't help you.

401
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:16,008
<i>I didn't want a deaf DJ</i>
<i>on the label.</i>

402
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:20,514
<i>I didn't want the company to be</i>
<i>touched with the deaf stamp.</i>

403
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,049
Well, business is tough...

404
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,813
...and sometimes you have
to make awkward decisions.

405
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:29,288
And I've made harder decisions
than dropping the deaf DJ.

406
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,223
<i>Frank just locks himself up</i>
<i>in his room...</i>

407
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,622
<i>... didn't come out</i>
<i>of his villa for a long time.</i>

408
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,286
<i>He had this theory he was gonna</i>
<i>get his hearing back...</i>

409
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,729
<i>... by having complete silence. He</i>
<i>wanted to rest his ears completely.</i>

410
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,995
<i>He hired people to bring in supplies</i>
<i>for him to the villa.</i>

411
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:49,731
<i>The only accounts we have</i>
<i>of Frank during this period...</i>

412
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,636
...come from various drug dealers.

413
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,470
He was in a very dark place.

414
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,348
I love you too.

415
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:41,954
- <i>Where is Frankie Wilde today?</i>
- <i>What? I haven't</i>...

416
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:45,891
<i>I haven't talked to him</i>
<i>in almost a year now.</i>

417
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:49,293
<i>I've heard some stories. This guy</i>
<i>supposedly saw him in New York...</i>

418
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:54,597
...wearing a garbage bag for a hat
and shoeboxes on his feet.

419
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:58,605
And he... And he had a rock...

420
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:01,539
...and he was trying to eat it
like a sandwich.

421
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:04,976
I don't...
I don't think Frankie would do that.

422
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,412
He looked like a bum.
He always looked like a bum.

423
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,018
But he had a really special bond
with the homeless.

424
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:47,586
Hello.

425
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:56,489
Hello?

426
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:57,928
Hello.

427
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:02,571
Is this where you come if you
want to learn how to read lips?

428
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,503
Of course. You want to learn?

429
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:12,037
I've got no idea
what you're saying, darling.

430
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,974
I can't hear anything.
This is the place, yeah?

431
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,422
They look like a couple of cunts.

432
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,075
I don't know how to lip read.

433
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,810
Maybe you should
write something down.

434
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:49,440
I can't hear you, and I can't read lips.
So we need to get started somehow.

435
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,520
So, maybe, write something down.

436
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,407
Temper, temper.

437
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,872
Watch.

438
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,878
Concentrate.

439
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,680
Watch my lips.

440
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:24,481
Watch...

441
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,485
...lips.

442
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,290
Tongue.

443
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,397
Jaw.

444
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,835
One's facial expression...

445
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,139
...gesture.

446
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,672
Lip reading...

447
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,004
...is about seeing...

448
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,737
...feeling.

449
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,257
Fill in the blanks, Frank.

450
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:20,602
Stepdad.

451
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,409
Husband.

452
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:37,115
The quick brown fox.

453
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,585
- The.
- The.

454
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,731
- Quick.
- Quick.

455
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,196
- <i>Brown.</i>
- Brown.

456
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,460
- <i>Fox.</i>
- Fox.

457
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:52,908
- <i>Jumps over the lazy...</i>
- Over the lazy dog.

458
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,441
Faster.

459
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:57,011
The quick brown fox...

460
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,512
...jumps over the lazy dog.

461
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,445
Good.

462
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:03,085
Good.

463
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,848
Fucking good.

464
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,957
They all speak English here.

465
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,561
Don't worry.

466
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,701
Scotch neat, please, mate.

467
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,199
Double Scotch neat.

468
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:31,313
- Is that okay?
- It's very good.

469
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,113
See what he comes back with.

470
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,385
To my lips.

471
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,255
Cheers.

472
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,234
You and me got the same hobby.

473
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,139
Another one?

474
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:04,237
What can I get you?

475
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,884
Scotch neat, please.

476
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,113
Double Scotch again.

477
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:18,723
In England, it means "fuck off."
Very similar gesture.

478
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:21,591
Fuck off. Double.

479
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,530
Double fuck off.

480
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,164
Waiter!

481
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,430
Double Scotch, please, mate.

482
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,777
No, more.

483
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:52,124
What do you want to drink to?
Do you want to drink to something?

484
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,423
Who's Simon?

485
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:58,066
Silence.

486
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:02,066
- Who is he?
- Not Simon, silence.

487
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,603
- Are you finished with him?
- Good.

488
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,241
Great.

489
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,267
I know what I could do.

490
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,063
I know what I could do.

491
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,633
I know what I could do.

492
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:09,033
Fuck the DJ lark.

493
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:12,902
You know on TV,
you got a little ugly bird...

494
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,534
...bottom right-hand corner,
doing all this business?

495
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,510
I could do that.
I could be a cool one.

496
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:21,445
A cool little fucker
in the corner of the box. I could.

497
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,745
Think positively.

498
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,447
Yeah. "Are you going down
to Pacha tonight?"

499
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:30,457
"Oh, no, mate. No, I'm staying in
because Frankie Wilde's...

500
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,187
...at the right-hand bottom corner
of the TV tonight...

501
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:36,230
...doing the fucking hand jive.
It'll be brilliant."

502
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,670
You finish?

503
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,144
You finish?

504
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:58,482
There's nothing wrong
with being deaf.

505
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,145
I'm deaf.

506
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,352
Trust your other senses.

507
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:05,892
Your sight,
your smell and your touch.

508
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:08,353
Just relax.

509
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,861
It will come.

510
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:13,225
It just takes time.

511
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,265
It will come.

512
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:23,606
<i>Well, Frank's system was ingenious,</i>
<i>and with the weight of his sight...</i>

513
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,680
<i>... he proclaims that he began</i>
<i>to see a rhythm in everything...</i>

514
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:29,079
...a pattern in the visual world
around him.

515
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,651
<i>You know, could see music.</i>

516
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,541
<i>Frankie had worked with this</i>
<i>all his life...</i>

517
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:03,075
<i>... and then he realized</i>
<i>he was able to piece together...</i>

518
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:06,476
<i>... those sets</i>
<i>that he used to do. And...</i>

519
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:11,109
Hey, presto, you know,
four to the floor, returneth.

520
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:04,304
I once stole 500 quid
from your wallet, in the studio.

521
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:05,940
Well...

522
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:08,972
...it's only money, eh? No big deal.

523
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,204
And it was me
who stuck that scaff bar...

524
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,541
...through the windscreen
of your Merc.

525
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:17,413
- It wasn't that Asian kid.
- Well, he's probably out now anyway...

526
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,850
...so no harm done.

527
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,651
I shagged Twila.

528
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:30,465
For three years.

529
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,773
Because you're a mate, yeah...

530
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:52,883
...I only ever made love
to her bum.

531
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,383
She doesn't like it in the bum.

532
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:02,024
Have a listen to this.
Tell me what you think.

533
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,597
Yeah?

534
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:17,378
Open the door! Frank!

535
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,037
Frank! Open the fucking door!

536
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,480
Open the door! Frank!

537
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:25,745
Frank! Open the fucking door!

538
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:27,912
Do you want some more coffee?

539
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:33,421
Frank! Frank! Open the door.
Open the fucking door.

540
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:36,458
- So?
- Oh, Frank. Oh, God.

541
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,099
- Yeah?
- Oh, God, it's good,

542
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:40,201
- Fucking good.
- It's good?

543
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,337
Okay, it's fucking hot.

544
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:45,234
First off, did you...? Who's this?

545
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,966
Max, this is Penelope.
Penelope, this is Max.

546
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,269
Hi, Max.

547
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:51,707
Hi.

548
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,575
Forget it.
Look, Did you mix this?

549
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,188
- Yeah.
- Did you produce this?

550
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:02,722
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

551
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:06,027
Fuck it, Frank. It's gold.
Fucking gold.

552
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:08,757
It's beautiful.

553
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,865
Tell me! I haven't heard it.

554
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:14,935
It gets in your fucking chest. I've never
heard nothing like it. Fucking:

555
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,766
Like fucking heart. It changed...

556
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,603
What...? What do you mean you
haven't heard it? What do you mean?

557
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,045
Well, I haven't heard it.

558
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,506
Why?

559
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,809
I'm completely deaf, Max.

560
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,952
Completely?

561
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,086
Yeah.

562
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:41,824
Nothing.

563
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,400
To the handicapped.

564
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,007
Sorry.

565
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:02,180
The first time I heard
<i>Hear No Evil...</i>

566
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:05,184
...I was like, you know, "Whatever."

567
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:09,085
But then Max told me
Frankie's story...

568
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:12,351
<i>... and the penny dropped.</i>

569
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:27,404
<i>People love a good tragedy.</i>

570
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:30,511
People love handicaps, frankly.

571
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:33,879
It gets them emotional, you know.

572
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:37,280
So I'll get on that deaf train
with a wheelchair ramp.

573
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:40,718
No problem.
First-class ticket, please.

574
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:10,307
<i>I don't see why we should limit</i>
<i>ourselves to deaf people, really.</i>

575
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:12,977
I don't want to reveal
too much either...

576
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:16,156
...about where we're going.
But it's gonna be big.

577
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:18,623
It's gonna be big,
and it's gonna be handicapped.

578
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:20,229
Imagine all the deaf people,
all the deaf people in the world.

579
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,958
Imagine all the deaf people,
all the deaf people in the world.

580
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,564
They need a fucking hero, Frank.

581
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,428
They don't have a fucking hero.
There's no deaf hero, huh?

582
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:27,728
It's you, Frank.

583
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,736
You're, like, the fucking link.

584
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:35,570
You're drawing all the deaf kids
that are screaming, with no hearing.

585
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,974
They're yelling out to...
Who's gonna listen?

586
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:41,446
Not other fucking deaf kids.
They can't hear, huh? You.

587
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:44,518
You're the fucking voice, eh?
And wait.

588
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:47,849
Wait. You're gonna love this.

589
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:52,684
Can you hear me?
"No, I can't hear you, Max.

590
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:56,024
Are you trying to make me money?"
Yes. I'm making you money. Okay.

591
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:57,495
Fuck, look...

592
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:01,124
...that is just the fucking beginning.

593
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:22,351
I wouldn't put my name to any
old product. If I could describe it...

594
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:26,019
...as bad speed in a can.

595
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:27,856
We've all had bad speed,
haven't we?

596
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,464
I'm just gonna have a sip.
I can't resist.

597
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,425
Fuck.

598
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:36,771
He made disabilities cool.

599
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:41,538
What's with the fucking ear?

600
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:45,305
The ear, that represents
your deafness, okay.

601
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,314
Deaf people hate their ears, see.
Don't they? See?

602
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,509
So it's symbolic.
So you're gonna smash it.

603
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:54,645
The deaf kids are gonna go fucking
nuts. Don't actually hit the ear...

604
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:57,849
...because I'll put some glass on that
and turn that into a table.

605
01:14:58,026 --> 01:15:01,427
It's wank. I'm sucking
deaf cock for you, mate...

606
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:06,398
...and I'm fucking choking on it.
- All right, first off, okay...

607
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,092
...you're sucking show-biz cock.

608
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,933
But look, this is gonna be
good money. This is all about cash.

609
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:14,871
Shitloads of cash, Frank.
And better than that...

610
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:18,410
...Sonya can't get her grubby fingers
on this fucking money, understand?

611
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:21,777
- This is Sonya-free cash.
- He's not a whore!

612
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,189
Look, Frank, okay?

613
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:32,622
You're not giving me any
fucking positive feedback.

614
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:35,922
I need fucking... You know what really
fucking bothers me about you?

615
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:38,328
The fact that you think art
just fucking happens.

616
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,866
It's just free.
Like these people just took out...

617
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:43,596
...time from their fucking day
to come down here...

618
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:46,707
...and do a bunch of shit for nothing.
What you gotta realize...

619
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,309
...is you're a hero.
That's what the yellow's about.

620
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:52,038
You make fun of me on that jacket.
I picked that jacket.

621
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:55,012
Deaf kids all over the world
are gonna see that yellow.

622
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:58,346
They'll run out, they'll buy that jacket.
Two, maybe $300.

623
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,420
They're gonna run around,
proudly deaf...

624
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:03,114
...all just yellow,
fluorescently deaf...

625
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,364
Sit down.

626
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:23,208
Charlize Bondo, <i>Ibiza Beat.</i>

627
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:26,313
Frankie, can you really DJ
as a deaf man?

628
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:28,312
How is that possible?

629
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:32,816
- They murmuring?
- Yeah, quite a bit.

630
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,785
I'm an honest man.

631
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:38,017
And I can tell you
that this album was made...

632
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:42,994
...completely without the aid
of my ears.

633
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:48,194
And at Pacha next week,
I'll be DJ'ing as a deaf man.

634
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:52,304
And if you don't believe me...

635
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:55,301
...you know, fuck you...

636
01:16:56,612 --> 01:17:01,640
...because I've got nothing,
nothing to prove...

637
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:06,379
...to you sluts at all.
- Okay. Okay. Role model.

638
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,857
- Nothing.
- Wait a minute. Okay, role model.

639
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:14,185
Listen. Listen to me. No. No.

640
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,729
He loves sluts. Frank loves sluts.

641
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:19,892
Now, I think what
he's trying to say is...

642
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:23,094
...even though he feels
he has nothing to prove to you...

643
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:29,540
...he'd be happy to prove
anything you want, to you.

644
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:34,871
It's important that we all realize that
this is a major comeback from a rock.

645
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:39,817
You know, what he's accomplished
in the last few months is astonishing.

646
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,889
He'll be at the Pacha nightclub.
You can come down...

647
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:45,526
...and watch him mix yourself...

648
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:48,094
...and watch the miracle
happen, okay?

649
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:52,563
Because, you know, I realize, okay,
that there are doubters in this room...

650
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:55,703
...which fucks me up.
Because, you know...

651
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:58,567
...why would someone
pretend to be deaf?

652
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:02,005
I mean, that's retarded.
That's ridic...

653
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:06,637
It's not like he's fucking benefiting
from this. It's a fucking obstacle.

654
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:09,215
He can't hear a fuck...
Your mom's a cunt. Nothing.

655
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:12,911
Zero. Blank. This man,
what he's done, fucking...

656
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:17,024
It gets me in my fucking heart,
what he's done. And you...

657
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:21,253
You come down here, and you
put on this big fucking show...

658
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,455
...like he's gonna
fucking make shit up!

659
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,998
Relax. Relax, man.

660
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:28,129
All right. Next question.

661
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:30,562
One more! One more!

662
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:44,551
I thought it was amazing,
you know, that somebody...

663
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,121
...that's deaf can actually...
Can actually...

664
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,882
...you know, be a DJ.

665
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,424
- Frankie Wilde, good luck.
- Good luck.

666
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:56,860
I just think that guy is so fantastic.
He has a gift that no one else has.

667
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:59,466
And somehow, he is gonna do it.

668
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:19,215
<i>Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!</i>

669
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,994
<i>The vibe that night</i>
<i>was incredible.</i>

670
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,991
All the memories had come back,
you know. He'd hit the depths...

671
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,533
<i>... then he was just back.</i>

672
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,418
Pacha, Frankie Wilde, comeback.

673
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:54,244
"Take this. Check this out."

674
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,890
I've never seen an atmosphere
like it. It was amazing.

675
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:00,556
<i>Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!</i>

676
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:04,143
<i>He probably never thought</i>
<i>he'd ever feel that again.</i>

677
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,186
And to come back
and actually feel that and more...

678
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:10,817
<i>... it was a great experience.</i>
<i>Everybody in the room...</i>

679
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:13,927
<i>... shared the same experience.</i>
<i>It was really, really special.</i>

680
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,495
<i>It was kind of what</i>
<i>dance music's about, really.</i>

681
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:26,540
He just had clubland sparking,
bigtime.

682
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:39,885
He just took the roof
off the place. It was amazing.

683
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:42,319
It was like
he was an even better DJ...

684
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:45,425
<i>... as a deaf man than he'd</i>
<i>been before. It was incredible.</i>

685
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:57,363
Frankie! Frankie!
We won it! Listen!

686
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:59,632
Fuck! We're the fucking champions!

687
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,799
We got the fucking award!

688
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:05,971
This is it.
This is our fucking moment!

689
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,340
There's nothing... I can't... Fuck.

690
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:11,144
What do you wanna do,
buy the moon?

691
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:14,720
We'll buy the moon! Doesn't matter.
You don't understand, it's huge.

692
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:16,413
Hold on.

693
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,697
Okay, they're gonna come in.
Fifteen minutes.

694
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:27,858
They all wanna talk to you.
Fifteen minutes.

695
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:30,402
Fifteen minutes, Frank.
This is a big moment.

696
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:33,439
Listen, it's important.
Fifteen minutes. That's all they need.

697
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:35,576
Tomorrow,
big, fucking press conference.

698
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,372
That's what we're gonna do.
Very important, okay?

699
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:39,979
- You have to watch.
- Max?

700
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:42,412
- What? What?
- Can you do me a favor, mate?

701
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:44,552
Anything. Anything.

702
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,516
Could you leave us alone
for 10 minutes?

703
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,156
No. See, you're not listening.
Okay, listen to me.

704
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:50,916
Look at my lips, okay? Okay?

705
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:54,220
They come in for 15 minutes
of your life. Fifteen minutes.

706
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,589
Fifteen fucking minutes. Frank.

707
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:59,563
No, no, no, no. Frank, no.
No. Frank.

708
01:24:01,503 --> 01:24:04,199
Frank, 10 minutes. Ten minutes.

709
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:07,965
Ten minutes.

710
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,804
Sure. Okay.

711
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:18,043
Yeah. Fucking sure.
What the fuck do I know?

712
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:34,867
Okay, now. All right, now.
Calm down.

713
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:37,163
Okay, you're getting in, buddy.
Don't worry.

714
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:40,830
You I used to like. All right.
You could do with some cheering up.

715
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:43,910
All right. Okay. Hold on. Okay.

716
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:49,211
Frankie?

717
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:52,450
Frankie!

718
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:06,699
Jesus Christ.

719
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:20,013
Frankie!

720
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:27,010
Frank! Fuck.

721
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:22,935
There was like a flat line.

722
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:25,208
It was...

723
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:28,378
Still, to this day, I'm...

724
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:33,983
That was it, gone.
Frankie Wilde, bye-bye. Gone.

725
01:26:34,656 --> 01:26:36,954
And everybody was like that:
Holding the baby.

726
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:09,913
<i>I've heard a story that he's running</i>
<i>a record shop in Oxford</i>.

727
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:13,618
There's a story that he went to Fiji
and then died of syphilis.

728
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:16,730
But nobody knows. You know,
I don't know where he is.

729
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,762
He was another deaf guy
with a deaf guy's needs.

730
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:23,667
And he went off...

731
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:26,033
...to a quiet place.

732
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,932
Although, I suppose that
wouldn't make much difference.
