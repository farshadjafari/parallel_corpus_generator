00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:24,507
l'm on my way back
from Benny's.

2
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:26,041
l'm almost home.

3
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,953
You tell me where you are,
l'll come get ya.

4
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:34,287
Ha. l wouldn't say
l'm drunk.

5
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,795
Ha ha. Hello?

6
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:39,554
Are you still there?

7
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:43,962
OK.

8
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,054
Ohh!

9
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,655
Oh, shit.

10
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:37,174
Shit.

11
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:03,404
A-Are you all right?

12
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:07,575
This is the fifth time
this year.

13
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:08,945
How many is it gonna take...

14
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:10,347
for the state
to put a fence up?

15
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:12,078
Which way'd it go?

16
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:13,107
Hmm?

17
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:14,780
The deer.

18
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:15,810
Where'd it go?

19
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,846
Oh. Uh...

20
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,819
l th--That way.

21
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:24,486
Oh, poor thing.

22
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,692
You sure you're all right?

23
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:29,167
Yeah, l'm fine.

24
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:30,863
l'm just a little
shaken up, that's all.

25
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,571
Hey, l have
my new cell phone with me.

26
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:36,734
l can call the police for you.

27
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:38,744
No! No, th-that's OK.

28
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:40,177
l, uh...

29
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:41,305
They're on their way already.

30
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:42,780
l'll call.

31
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:44,181
Chief's a friend of mine.

32
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,117
No, it's all right. You really
don't have to do that.

33
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,141
No, it's no trouble.

34
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:49,678
l pay for this thing.
l never use it.

35
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:51,850
l live just up the hill.

36
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,324
You're welcome to wait
there if you want.

37
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:56,920
No, thanks.
l told them l'd be here.

38
00:06:56,963 --> 00:07:00,057
Yes. Calling about
another deer collision...

39
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,108
Musta leaped.

40
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:28,376
l'm sorry?

41
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,151
There's no damage
to your radiator.

42
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:33,989
Usually, you'd be pickin'
kneecaps outta your grill.

43
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,290
Are you injured?

44
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:38,422
Heh. No, sir.

45
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:41,529
You had anything
to drink tonight?

46
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:42,967
Nope.

47
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:45,798
l'll need your license
and registration.

48
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,967
Of course.

49
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,118
l don't have
my license on me.

50
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,781
l must have left it at home.

51
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:07,154
lt's unlawful to operate a
motor vehicle without a license.

52
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:08,182
l have one.

53
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:09,820
l just--l left it.

54
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:11,854
Forgot it.

55
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:13,024
Your name's Jack Levin?

56
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,055
Levine.

57
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,499
Levine?

58
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:17,298
You're the owner
of this vehicle?

59
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:19,430
That is correct.

60
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:22,908
Mr. Levine, would you object
to a breathalyzer?

61
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,408
l prefer a sobriety test.

62
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:29,847
That's your right.

63
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:31,441
Please step out of the car.

64
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:35,981
Sober up. You can do this.

65
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:44,758
Right back here.

66
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:50,829
Recite the alphabet backwards.

67
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:53,936
Um...

68
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:55,406
Go ahead.

69
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,207
Z-Y-X-W-V-U-T...

70
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:02,373
Um...

71
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:04,815
S-R-Q...

72
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:11,415
P-O-N-M-L-K-J-l-H...

73
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,463
You want me to walk
a straight line or anything?

74
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:24,868
No, that won't be necessary.

75
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:26,098
OK.

76
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:28,039
Wait here.

77
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,418
Mr. Levine...

78
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:52,124
your license to drive
was revoked three months ago...

79
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:53,632
following a D.U.l. charge.

80
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,499
l'm placing you under arrest
and impounding your vehicle.

81
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,265
Oh, please, not the car.

82
00:10:58,304 --> 00:10:59,794
Turn around, place
your palms flat on the trunk.

83
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,298
Right now.

84
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:09,412
Sorry about the tie.

85
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:10,473
Out of cuffs.

86
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:17,320
What's in the trunk?

87
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:20,849
You need a warrant
to look in the trunk.

88
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:21,917
l know the law.

89
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,258
Oh, really?

90
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:25,730
So then you know the term
''exigent circumstance''?

91
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,658
There's nothin' in there
but an old tarp.

92
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:31,795
See?

93
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:44,205
You sick fuck.

94
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,717
l...

95
00:11:45,752 --> 00:11:46,844
You think just because
you didn't shoot her...

96
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:48,285
you can cart her off?

97
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:50,311
Her?

98
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:52,517
l don't see any antlers, do you?

99
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:54,822
lt's not even season yet.

100
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:56,795
Well, l didn't think
it should go to waste.

101
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,491
l mean, l know venison
is expensive, but Jesus.

102
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,828
She's messed up really badly.

103
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:03,858
l don't think
you want to look at--

104
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:04,927
Did l ask you?

105
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:18,073
Got her wedged in here
pretty good.

106
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,919
Fuck!

107
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:26,916
L-Car-1 to dispatch, over.

108
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,722
Go ahead, George.

109
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:31,229
Overpass collision
not a deer, but a man.

110
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,731
Repeat, a man.

111
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,824
Locate next of kin for...

112
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:37,233
name: Aaron Lewis.

113
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,500
Lima, Echo, Whiskey,
lndia, Sierra.

114
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:42,167
Driver in custody.
Request assistance.

115
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,039
Jesus, you're having
a rough night.

116
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:45,601
l'll get on the horn.
Sit tight.

117
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:47,840
You have the right
to remain silent.

118
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,280
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

119
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:51,305
You have a right
to an attorney.

120
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,408
l waive my Miranda rights.

121
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:53,441
What?

122
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:54,714
l waive my Miranda rights.

123
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:55,778
l'm sick of hearin' 'em.

124
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:58,186
Fine. Third time tonight.

125
00:12:58,224 --> 00:12:59,555
l'm gettin' pretty
sick of 'em, myself.

126
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,589
Move over. You got company.

127
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:03,492
l was here first.

128
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:04,518
This isn't a cab.

129
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:05,690
Just shut up and move over.

130
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:07,358
There isn't any room.

131
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,526
Why don't you put him in front?

132
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:10,092
l need you to move
over right now.

133
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:11,569
l gotta put someone else
back here. Move over.

134
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:12,901
Duffy, can you move over?

135
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:13,928
Make some room.

136
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:15,440
l'm trying.

137
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:20,836
Fuck!

138
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:27,550
Duffy, come on!

139
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:06,722
Ohh!

140
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:12,021
Frank?!

141
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:17,094
Oh, it's you.

142
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,163
Have you seen my husband?

143
00:14:20,206 --> 00:14:22,140
l sent him to look
for the deer.

144
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,733
l have to find him right away.

145
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:24,765
Can you help me?

146
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,300
l really have to get home.

147
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:28,006
Please? Something terrible...

148
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:30,404
Frank?

149
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:31,438
Uhh.

150
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:32,473
l'm OK.

151
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:33,542
Frank!

152
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:43,889
Frank, where are you?

153
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:53,202
This can't be happening.

154
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,802
What happened?

155
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:58,105
Chief, uh...

156
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,374
Garvey called.

157
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,583
My only child...

158
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:12,748
has been hit by a car.

159
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:16,723
They just called?

160
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,889
Right after l came home...

161
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:23,129
just, um...a few minutes
after l left you.

162
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:34,736
You...

163
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,179
Freeze!

164
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:38,614
Please step back, ma'am.

165
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:40,710
l tried to help you.

166
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:41,879
lt was an accident.

167
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:43,252
Ma'am, step away.

168
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,881
Some goddamn deer!

169
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:46,255
lt all happened so fast.

170
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:47,520
Let me handle this! Ma'am!

171
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,720
Are you drunk?

172
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:52,021
l'm sorry.

173
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,788
Ma'am, ma'am!

174
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,358
l'll kill you!
l'll kill you!

175
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:57,391
Calm down!

176
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:58,903
l'll kill you!

177
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:14,243
Aah! Uhh!

178
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:15,879
Ohh.

179
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,782
Huh? Huh?

180
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:26,458
Don't move!

181
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:32,360
You'll burn...

182
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,498
for what you did
to my daughter.

183
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:39,306
Daughter?

184
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,174
You're such a dick!

185
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:26,088
-Glad you could make it, Timmy.
-Dumbass.

186
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,319
Turn the fucking music down.

187

Except that's our first sign

You're gonna burn a book?

204
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:08,657
lt's not like this is great

OK. See, what you gotta do
is crumple the pages...

215
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:35,026
so you can get
the air in there, OK?

216
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,221

-How many of those have you had?
-Like, four.

00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:30,571
You're fucking kidding me,

Calm down!

273
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:56,993
My mom doesn't even know
l have the goddamn car!

274
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:03,668
Hey, keep pressure on it.

275

282
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:28,296
What do you mean no, Eddie?

283
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:29,426
Jesus, look at you.

284
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:32,266
We have to go back
and get it first.

285
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:35,034
Eddie, you're bleeding
pretty bad.

286
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:37,770
Maybe we should just
take you to the hospital.

287
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,338

to live like this!

288

Tim, it's been cut off.

They can reattach it.

301

Well, how the fuck

302

354
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:12,854

Don't worry. He's busy.

368
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,201
Sorry it took me so long, man.

369
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,470
l was lookin'
for something bigger.

370
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:40,400
Oh, hey...

371
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:41,969
l'm sorry.

372
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:44,244
Even if they put it back on...

373
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:46,513
it's not gonna
work the same.

374
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:50,112
Sure, it will.

375
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:52,555
Your dick's like Timex, dude.

376
00:27:04,636 --> 00:27:06,831
We're gonna have to
go to the police, man.

377
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:08,840
Well, that's easy
for you to say, Tim.

378
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:10,102
You weren't the one
that was driving.

379
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:11,698
Well, what do you want
to do, Mark?

380
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:14,739
We can't just skip town.
He saw our faces.

381
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,077
Well, l'm not saying that.

382
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:18,742
l'm just saying
let's get our story straight.

383
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:19,808
OK?

384
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,910
OK.

385
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:25,219
OK. Um...

386
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:28,021
OK, Eddie was
pissin' out the window.

387
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,325
OK, yeah, Eddie was
pissin' out the window...

388
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:36,858
but, uh, but l never
turned around, ya know?

389
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:38,995
l never turned around.
l was never hitting him...

390
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:40,902
and--and she just
ran out in front of me...

391
00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:43,100
and l didn't have time
to stop.

392
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,132
OK.

393
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:47,702
Did you hear that, Eddie?
l never hit you.

394
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:50,476
Why should l lie?

395
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:55,846
Wh--What are you
talking about?

396
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:58,913
Why should l lie
when this is all your fault?

397
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:01,425
My fault? How the fuck
is this my fault?

398
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,486
Well, if ya hadn't been so
worried about your paint job...

399
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,258
my penis would be
in my pants right now...

400
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:08,061
and not in my fucking hand!

401
00:28:09,668 --> 00:28:12,034
lf you hadn't have been pissin'
out the goddamn window...

402
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,503
none of this
would have happened!

403
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:14,527
Guys, calm down.

404
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,131
No, you stay out of this, Tim!

405
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:19,041
Now, listen, l'm not going
to jail over your little dick...

406
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,977
so you can either say
l didn't hit you...

407
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:23,675
or you can bleed
to death for all l care!

408
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:25,876
Say it!

409
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:29,483
You didn't hit me.

410
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:09,421
lts expandable
stomach allows the Komodo...

411
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:12,589
to devour up to eighty percent
of its body weight...

412
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:14,292
in a single meal.

413
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:23,230
Mulligan, come on.

414
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:26,804
You have a good nap, boy?

415
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:28,938
We're gonna go
for a little walk.

416
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:26,360
No, no, no, no.

417
00:30:28,707 --> 00:30:30,140
Oh, my God.

418
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:34,912
Oh, Cheri, oh, God,
what have you done?

419
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,822
Oh, you little pervert.

420
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:50,293
You left her no choice,
didn't you?

421
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:53,926
No.

422
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:57,457
No, l will not see you
ruin her life.

423
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:59,026
No.

424
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,733
OK, what do we do? Ohh.

425
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:46,178
No. Come on.

426
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:29,951
Stay.

427
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:33,120
Stay, stay. Stay, boy.

428
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:10,291
Oh, no.

429
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:24,248
Freakin' imports!

430
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:32,280
OK.

431
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:38,355
Oh, God.

432
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,195
Ohh...

433
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:53,977
Oh, no. Oh, no. No.

434
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:55,138
Please. Shit! Shit!

435
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:08,225
Oh, no. Son of a...

436
00:34:19,738 --> 00:34:21,706
Stay. Stay.

437
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,674
OK.

438
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,004
Don't be
looking at me like that.

439
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:00,037
Cheri going to jail is
not gonna change anything.

440
00:35:00,078 --> 00:35:01,943
The guy's dead.

441
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:07,348
Oh, my God.

442
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:13,588
Oh, that's better.

443
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:25,259
Stupid little shits!

444
00:35:28,273 --> 00:35:29,365
Oh, my God.

445
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:35,773
God almighty.

446
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:38,476
Assholes.

447
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:24,151
Mulligan!

448
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:25,321
Mulligan, get down!

449
00:36:25,363 --> 00:36:27,058
Mulligan.

450
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:44,239
OK.

451
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,051
Oh, Lord, please forgive me
for what l'm about to do.

452
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:24,111
OK.

453
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:47,536
Mulligan!

454
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,103
Mulligan, get over here.

455
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:51,945
Mulligan, come.
Mulligan, come here now.

456
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:55,582
Mulligan, come now.

457
00:38:01,225 --> 00:38:02,920
Mulligan, come here.

458
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:04,019
That's my baby boy.

459
00:38:04,062 --> 00:38:06,053
That's a good boy.
Come here.

460
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:08,224
Come here.
Yes, sweetheart.

461
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:10,461
No. No. No. No.
Come back, you dog.

462
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:12,298

463
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:22,838
Mulligan. Mulligan.
That's a good boy.

464
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,474
OK, dog, give me that thing.

465
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:41,463
Mulligan, come on!

466
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,066
There you are.

467
00:38:54,012 --> 00:38:55,843
Ah, shit! Oh, shit!

468
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,541
Shit.

469
00:38:57,582 --> 00:38:59,914
Come here.
Come here. Come here.

470
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:02,112
Mulligan.

471
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:04,747
Dog, l oughta rip you
a new asshole.

472
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:06,689
You bad dog.

473
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:08,589
Bad dog.

474
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:10,253
Now, where is it?

475
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:16,797
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God.

476
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:18,529
Come on.

477
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:10,544
Frank?

478
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:20,561
Honey, what are you doing?

479
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:23,499
Well, l--l...

480
00:40:23,534 --> 00:40:26,867
l caught these punk kids running
around, starting fires...

481
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:29,338
so l scared 'em off.

482
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:30,465
And, uh...

483
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:35,443
l was just trying to kick
this fire into the sewer.

484
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,607
Be careful. You don't wanna be
hurtin' your back now.

485
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:39,411
Oh, God, l know.

486
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,916
Hop in. You look tired.

487
00:40:42,954 --> 00:40:44,683
Uh...

488
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:47,989
Come on, Mulligan.

489
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:52,323
Sit.

490
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,860
Oh, hi.

491
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:03,299
So, how was your night?

492
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:04,535
OK.

493
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:06,674
Just OK?

494
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:08,705
Yeah.

495
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:12,448
l wonder what happened.

496
00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:16,676
Oh, that reminds me.

497
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:18,245
Another deer got hit tonight.

498
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:20,048
Really? Where?

499
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:22,184
Same spot just down
from our house.

500
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:23,887
Happened a few minutes ago.

501
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:26,158
So it ran into our woods...

502
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:28,631
and l want you to go see
if he's still alive.

503
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:31,735
Frank?

504
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:33,396
Huh? Um...

505
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:34,461
Yeah, OK.

506
00:41:35,973 --> 00:41:38,066
Mulligan,
what have you been eating?

507
00:41:57,595 --> 00:41:59,654
-Hit the lock.
-Ah.

508
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:02,698
Come on out, young fella.

509
00:42:06,704 --> 00:42:08,672
Oh, thanks. Hey, you.

510
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:10,071
-You got him?
-Yeah.

511
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:12,166
Oh, here, here, here.
Take this.

512
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,576
'Cause if the deer's still alive
l don't wanna spook him.

513
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:15,943
Who could that be
at this hour?

514
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:19,778
OK, l'll see you later.

515
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:20,841
OK.

516
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:31,051
OK.

517
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:57,171
Hey, Duff.

518
00:43:57,214 --> 00:43:59,239
What's going on?

519
00:43:59,283 --> 00:44:00,750
Not much.

520
00:44:02,553 --> 00:44:03,781
You want me
to lock up for you?

521
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:10,086
Yeah. lt's about that time.

522
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:22,565
How was your shift?

523
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:24,471
Fucking boring.

524
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:27,102
Whole goddamn town
shuts down at nine o'clock.

525
00:44:28,479 --> 00:44:29,810
What else is new?

526
00:44:40,624 --> 00:44:41,648
Are you OK?

527
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:44,459
You don't look so good.

528
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,959
l got a call this morning.

529
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,261
From who?

530
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,289
Cheri.

531
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:51,528
So?

532
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:53,628
She's pregnant.

533
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,777
Are you sure it's yours?

534
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:07,610
Of course it's mine!

535
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:08,879
Whose the fuck else
would it be?

536
00:45:08,919 --> 00:45:09,908
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean anything.

537
00:45:09,954 --> 00:45:11,353
Don't worry about it.

538
00:45:11,389 --> 00:45:12,879
Just, it's fine.

539
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:14,390
What are you gonna do?

540
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:15,483
What do you think?

541
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:17,016
She's gotta get
an abortion, right?

542
00:45:17,061 --> 00:45:19,120
That's expensive.

543
00:45:19,163 --> 00:45:20,630
Well, no shit,
it's fuckin' expensive.

544
00:45:20,664 --> 00:45:21,892
That's my problem.

545
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:25,361
How much?

546
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:27,337
Five hundred dollars.

547
00:45:30,374 --> 00:45:32,604
Guess a two-dollar condom's
lookin' pretty good...

548
00:45:32,643 --> 00:45:33,871
right about now.

549
00:45:33,911 --> 00:45:35,173
That's just it.

550
00:45:35,212 --> 00:45:36,577
We were always safe.

551
00:45:36,614 --> 00:45:37,911
l don't know how
this could've happened.

552
00:45:41,652 --> 00:45:43,882
There's not much point
in worrying about it now.

553
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:49,086
We're closed.

554
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:51,526
Well, he's in there.

555
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:53,029
He works here.

556
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:54,429
Please. We'll be really fast.

557
00:45:54,465 --> 00:45:55,523
l promise.

558
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,565
Come on.

559
00:45:58,602 --> 00:46:00,092
Duff, l cashed out already.

560
00:46:03,374 --> 00:46:05,365
-You're a prince.
-Thanks.

561
00:46:11,582 --> 00:46:13,812
Those doughnuts are old.

562
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:15,682
Doesn't matter.

563
00:46:21,525 --> 00:46:23,254
4.89.

564
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:26,396
What's in there?

565
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:29,866
Uh, Bong Water. Six.

566
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,891
9.48.

567
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:34,700
Keep the change.

568
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:38,898
You want one?

569
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:40,171
Yeah, they're old.

570
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:44,311
Blah!

571
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:54,085
She got any money?

572
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:56,184
No. Her dad
buys her everything...

573
00:46:56,227 --> 00:46:57,626
and this is
obviously one bill...

574
00:46:57,661 --> 00:46:59,219
that she doesn't
want him to see.

575
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:01,163
Well, what about you?

576
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:03,928
l blew my wad on
the new transmission last month.

577
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:05,765
So what are you gonna do?

578
00:47:05,803 --> 00:47:08,294
Well, that's what l've been
thinking about all day.

579
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:12,002
l could ask my dad,
but there's just no way.

580
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:14,272
l thought about asking Lloyd
for an advance...

581
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:15,403
but you know how he is.

582
00:47:15,446 --> 00:47:16,470
Yeah.

583
00:47:16,514 --> 00:47:18,414
So that only leaves one thing.

584
00:47:21,418 --> 00:47:23,511
l'm gonna rob this place.

585
00:47:25,256 --> 00:47:26,951
Yeah, right.

586
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,984
No way.

587
00:47:32,596 --> 00:47:33,790
No fucking way.

588
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:35,992
Lloyd finds
one bill missing...

589
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:38,365
and he's gonna fire me,
and l need this job.

590
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:40,529
My sister's sick.
You know that.

591
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:44,132
l know, and l'm sorry,
but l don't have a choice.

592
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:46,336
Well, take it on your own shift.

593
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:48,368
l can't.
She needs the money tomorrow.

594
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:49,470
Why?

595
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:51,140
Because her parents
are gonna be gone all day.

596
00:47:51,182 --> 00:47:52,547
lt's the only time she can go.

597
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:55,143
Well, she's just
gonna have to wait.

598
00:47:55,186 --> 00:47:57,416
You're not taking any money
from here tonight...

599
00:47:57,454 --> 00:47:58,978
and that's that.

600
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:06,157
l don't believe this.

601
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:08,324
Please, Buzzy,
just give me the money?

602
00:48:08,365 --> 00:48:10,890
You gonna shoot me, huh?

603
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:12,402
Buzzy.

604
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:16,329
Would you shoot Cheri
if l needed money?

605
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:17,397
Oh, come on.

606
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:18,669
Why do you always
have to do this?

607
00:48:18,709 --> 00:48:19,801
Well, would you?

608
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:22,107
Just tell Lloyd you were robbed.
ls that so hard?

609
00:48:22,146 --> 00:48:24,307
l'm a bad liar.

610
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:26,748
But you won't be lying.

611
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:28,752
lt's not like he's
got surveillance or anything.

612
00:48:28,786 --> 00:48:31,380
He's been looking
for a reason to fire me anyway.

613
00:48:36,994 --> 00:48:38,928
Are you gonna give me
the money or not?

614
00:48:40,364 --> 00:48:41,695
Look...

615
00:48:41,732 --> 00:48:43,723
you know l wanna help you.

616
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:45,894
Don't ask me to do this.

617
00:48:45,936 --> 00:48:47,403
Melinda's got no insurance.

618
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:49,531
She needs
every dollar we've got.

619
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:53,871
Just--Come on. Just--

620
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:55,902
No. You do what you gotta do...

621
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:57,038
but l'm not gonna
open up this drawer.

622
00:49:00,551 --> 00:49:02,678
God. Damn it.

623
00:49:05,556 --> 00:49:06,614
Look at me.

624
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:09,454
Why, so you can
shoot me in the face?

625
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:11,290
Come on. Just look at me.

626
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:15,627
God damn it,
you're so stubborn!

627
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:19,034
Lloyd's an idiot
if he fires you!

628
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:21,162
Christ, he should
make you the manager!

629
00:49:21,905 --> 00:49:23,372
Jesus.

630
00:49:30,748 --> 00:49:31,737
Hey.

631
00:49:31,782 --> 00:49:34,376
Hey. l gotta talk to you.

632
00:49:37,388 --> 00:49:38,514
OK.

633
00:49:44,795 --> 00:49:46,023
Be right back.

634
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:56,599
What's up?

635
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,165
Did you get the money?

636
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:03,736
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

637
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:04,968
l didn't mean to.

638
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:06,600
Why?!

639
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:07,871
l didn't mean anything.

640
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:09,640
Give me that fucking thing.

641
00:51:11,582 --> 00:51:14,244
Better get you out of here.

642
00:51:14,284 --> 00:51:17,344
l'm dead.
l'm--l'm so dead.

643
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:22,487
Hey, could l borrow your jacket?
lt's cold out.

644
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:24,551
Yeah.

645
00:51:33,203 --> 00:51:35,068
l love you.

646
00:51:42,346 --> 00:51:44,678
All right, you can
blame this on the robber.

647
00:51:44,715 --> 00:51:45,909
Say he shot and missed.

648
00:51:45,949 --> 00:51:46,938
Will you stop thinking
about your own problem...

649
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:47,973
for one minute?

650
00:51:48,018 --> 00:51:49,280
l'm trying to save my job!

651
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:51,651
Buzzy, l am saving your job.

652
00:51:51,688 --> 00:51:52,712
Think about it.

653
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:54,849
The cops are probably
on their way already.

654
00:51:54,892 --> 00:51:57,725
How much cash
is in the register?

655
00:51:57,761 --> 00:51:59,456
1,200 and change.

656
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:04,599
Duffy, no.

657
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:05,761
You're not thinking.

658
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:07,896
You're not thinking
things clearly here, OK?

659
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:09,769
This way, you get
to keep your job...

660
00:52:09,807 --> 00:52:13,607
and then seven hundred dollars
goes straight to Melinda.

661
00:52:21,618 --> 00:52:22,710
Good.

662
00:52:29,293 --> 00:52:31,227
No, just take it all.
l'll get mine later.

663
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:37,793
Wait. One thing you have
to do for me before you go.

664
00:52:37,835 --> 00:52:39,928
-What?
-Shoot me.

665
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,164
What?!

666
00:52:41,205 --> 00:52:45,232
Lloyd will know
l'm lying in a second.

667
00:52:45,275 --> 00:52:46,572
But if you shoot me...

668
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:49,101
l'm hurt, he can't
ask any questions.

669
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:50,340
Are you out of your mind?

670
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,109
No, l'm serious, Duffy.

671
00:52:52,149 --> 00:52:53,616
l need this job.

672
00:52:54,685 --> 00:52:55,709
l can't!

673
00:52:55,752 --> 00:52:56,776
Duffy?

674
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,082
No. No.

675
00:52:59,056 --> 00:53:00,580
l'll tell Cheri
about that time last summer.

676
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:05,960
You wouldn't.

677
00:53:17,107 --> 00:53:18,438
All right.

678
00:53:20,777 --> 00:53:21,835
All right.

679
00:53:21,879 --> 00:53:24,746
Um, wait. No. Go over here.

680
00:53:24,781 --> 00:53:27,944
That way it'll look like
it's a real robbery, you know?

681
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:29,282
All right, good thinking.

682
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:32,186
All right. OK.

683
00:53:32,222 --> 00:53:33,211
All right.

684
00:53:33,257 --> 00:53:34,849
Where do you want it?

685
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:39,929
ln my arm.

686
00:53:39,963 --> 00:53:41,931
Wait. l'm right-handed.
Here. My left arm.

687
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:42,989
All right.

688
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:46,927
Here.

689
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:47,994
There?

690
00:53:48,038 --> 00:53:49,505
Yes. You can't shoot
through my arm.

691
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,134
-All right, are you sure?
-l'm sure.

692
00:53:52,175 --> 00:53:54,473
-OK, right here.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

693
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:56,536
You ready?

694
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,569
You ready?

695
00:53:57,614 --> 00:53:59,445
Ow! God.

696
00:53:59,483 --> 00:54:02,475
Ow? That's nothing compared
to what it's gonna feel like.

697
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,009
Have you thought about
what it's gonna feel like?

698
00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:05,078
lt's gonna hurt.

699
00:54:05,122 --> 00:54:07,317
Go.

700
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:08,415
Ready?

701
00:54:14,965 --> 00:54:16,660
Goddamn it!
l can't fucking do it!

702
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,167
lt's the worst idea
you ever had!

703
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:19,862
Duffy, you have to do this.

704
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,892
l can't do it.

705
00:54:20,938 --> 00:54:22,496
As my friend, just do it.

706
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:24,166
l want you to do it.

707
00:54:25,108 --> 00:54:26,837
Just make it quick
before l think.

708
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:27,901
All right.

709
00:54:27,945 --> 00:54:29,606
We'll do it on three, OK?

710
00:54:29,646 --> 00:54:31,238
Yeah. Yeah!

711
00:54:31,281 --> 00:54:32,748
Three...three...three...

712
00:54:32,783 --> 00:54:34,216
-You ready?
-Yeah.

713
00:54:34,251 --> 00:54:36,310
One--

714
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:37,342
Ow! Ow!

715
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:39,150
Oh, my God!
l'm so fucking sorry!

716
00:54:39,189 --> 00:54:40,178
l'm so fucking sorry!

717
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:42,885
Ow! You said on three!

718
00:54:42,926 --> 00:54:44,917
l thought you might flinch.
l didn't wanna hit the bone.

719
00:54:44,962 --> 00:54:47,328
What can l do?
l'm really sorry.

720
00:54:47,364 --> 00:54:48,592
l'm so sorry!
l didn't mean--

721
00:54:48,632 --> 00:54:50,566
Then get me
something for my arm!

722
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:54,560
OK. l'm sorry.

723
00:54:54,605 --> 00:54:58,097
Oh, God.
Oh, God, does it hurt?

724
00:54:58,141 --> 00:54:59,165
Yes!

725
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:03,475
This was your idea!
lt's not working!

726
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:05,572
Give it to me!
Get the phone!

727
00:55:05,616 --> 00:55:06,742
OK, the phone. Why?

728
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:08,375
9-1-1.

729
00:55:08,418 --> 00:55:09,885
l can't call 9-1-1.

730
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,182
Well, then, get it for me!

Where's the fucking phone?!

00:55:15,225 --> 00:55:17,955
The pager! Hit the pager!

735
00:55:19,529 --> 00:55:21,997
Ow! Oh!

737
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:28,065
Who puts the fucking phone

738
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:30,130
Ow!

Uh, l was shot.

748
00:55:54,398 --> 00:55:56,730

Thank you, baby.

Calm down.

752
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:28,624
Calm down, Duff.

753

Everything's cool.

754
00:56:30,534 --> 00:56:33,230
Everything is cool.

755
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:36,698
Everything's cool.

756
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,231
Jesus, that was fast.

757
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:06,299

758
00:57:30,127 --> 00:57:31,526

My car won't start!

761
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:48,471
Where the fuck's
my bowling ball?

762
00:58:01,758 --> 00:58:03,055
Look out!

763
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:06,795

00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,740
Come on, wake up. Wake up!

767
00:58:22,379 --> 00:58:23,403

00:58:45,368 --> 00:58:46,995
Go! Go! Go! Go!

772
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:11,958
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down right now.

773
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:14,453
On the ground,
nice and slow.

774
00:59:14,497 --> 00:59:16,021
That's right.

775
00:59:17,334 --> 00:59:20,792
Face down toward the curb,
hands behind your back.

776
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:22,668
Do it right now.

777
00:59:39,456 --> 00:59:41,014
You have the right
to remain silent.

778
00:59:41,057 --> 00:59:43,582
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

779
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:44,616
You have the right
to an attorney.

780
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:45,753
lf you cannot afford one...

781
00:59:45,795 --> 00:59:46,887
one will be
appointed for you.

782
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:47,988
lf you choose
to answer questions...

783
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:49,055
you have the right
to stop at any time.

784
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:51,033
Do you understand these rights
as l have read them to you?

785
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:52,056
Yeah.

786
00:59:52,102 --> 00:59:53,262
OK, watch your head.

787
01:00:01,811 --> 01:00:05,303
Dispatch, l need
medical to Center pronto.

788
01:00:05,348 --> 01:00:07,009
l'm on it.

789
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:24,894
Ugh!

790
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:32,003
Jesus.

791
01:00:48,325 --> 01:00:49,883
You wanna tell me
what happened?

792
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:52,685
They hit her.

793
01:00:52,729 --> 01:00:54,321
Who?

794
01:00:54,364 --> 01:00:56,457
Those kids.

795
01:00:56,499 --> 01:00:59,195
l don't know their names.
They're in a blue van.

796
01:00:59,235 --> 01:01:02,727
Someone reported a suspect
fitting your description...

797
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:05,002
shooting a clerk at Lloyd's
a few minutes ago.

798
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:07,771
l know you work there.

799
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:11,038
The gun and the money?

800
01:01:14,784 --> 01:01:16,251
How 'bout the penis?

801
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:30,596
How you guys doing?

802
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:32,863
George, we got the shooting
victim in the back, OK?

803
01:01:32,902 --> 01:01:35,268
We got a human penis
right there by the curb.

804
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:37,068
Somebody's gotta be
looking for that.

805
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:39,007
l'm not getting a pulse.

806
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:41,567
One, two, three, four, five...

807
01:01:41,611 --> 01:01:43,636
Mind stepping down for a second?

808
01:01:45,248 --> 01:01:48,479
-Keep going.
-Massive head trauma.

809
01:01:51,621 --> 01:01:53,111
We got a suspect
over in the car.

810
01:01:53,156 --> 01:01:54,282
You wanna come take
a look at him?

811
01:01:54,324 --> 01:01:56,292
Can you l.D. him for me?

812
01:01:56,326 --> 01:01:58,794
He's over in the car.

813
01:01:58,828 --> 01:02:01,058
Um...no.

814
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:02,325
What do you got to tell me?

815
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,562
Yes.

816
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:07,729
l should really stay in
the ambulance because of this.

817
01:02:07,771 --> 01:02:10,069
Are you hearing
what l'm saying?

818
01:02:11,841 --> 01:02:13,069
You have the right
to remain silent.

819
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:14,406
Anything you say can
and will be used against you...

820
01:02:14,444 --> 01:02:15,638
in a court of law.

821
01:02:15,678 --> 01:02:17,043
You have the right
to an attorney.

822
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,138
lf you cannot afford one...

823
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:19,443
one will be appointed
for you.

824
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:20,779
Just breathe.

825
01:02:20,817 --> 01:02:22,808
Do you understand those rights
as l have read them to you?

826
01:02:24,087 --> 01:02:25,111
Yes?

827
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:46,105
l'm sorry.

828
01:02:46,142 --> 01:02:48,110
L-Car-1 en route to station.

829
01:02:48,144 --> 01:02:50,112
Robbery suspects in custody.

830
01:02:50,146 --> 01:02:51,272
Be advised...

831
01:02:51,314 --> 01:02:53,111
hit-and-run suspects
at large in a blue van.

832
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:54,275
Over.

833
01:02:54,317 --> 01:02:55,443
Hey, we just got a call...

834
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:57,282
about a deer collision
under the overpass.

835
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,788
Be a hon and check it out
on your way back, OK?

836
01:02:59,823 --> 01:03:01,620
Can it wait?

837
01:03:01,658 --> 01:03:04,752
Sorry. Friend of the chief's.

838
01:03:06,096 --> 01:03:07,188
Ten-four.

839
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:01,443
Steph, what are you doing?

840
01:04:01,484 --> 01:04:04,715
Calling you.
Has Aaron been over yet?

841
01:04:04,754 --> 01:04:06,745
Never should've told you
about him.

842
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:10,225
Hmph. l can't believe
you're making them both pay.

843
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:12,558
Why shouldn't they?
l don't know whose it is.

844
01:04:12,595 --> 01:04:14,722
Yeah, but they
could've split it...

845
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:16,925
if they knew about each other.

846
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:19,400
Heh. So when are you
having it done?

847
01:04:19,435 --> 01:04:21,062
Tomorrow.

848
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:22,571
Are you scared?

849
01:04:22,605 --> 01:04:26,063
Nah. Listen. l gotta go.

850
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:27,667
Aaron's here.

851
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,041
l'll call you later.

852
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:34,007
Coming up at eleven:
The Komodo dragon.

853
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:43,088
So, is that Aaron's car outside?

854
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:44,115
Yeah.

855
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,252
...not seeing him anymore.

856
01:04:45,295 --> 01:04:46,455
l'm not.

857
01:04:49,299 --> 01:04:50,630
l'm just hanging out.

858
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:52,760
Cheri.

859
01:04:53,736 --> 01:04:54,794
Cheri.

860
01:04:56,139 --> 01:04:58,903
l do not trust that guy.

861
01:04:58,942 --> 01:05:00,637
So you said.

862
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:02,635
Look at me!

863
01:05:05,582 --> 01:05:08,050
lf he hits you again,
l'll kill him.

864
01:05:09,752 --> 01:05:11,379
l can take care of myself.

865
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:14,083
This week,
we focus on nature.

866
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:17,615
Travel to the remote
Komodo lsland in lndonesia.

867
01:05:34,877 --> 01:05:36,242
What's up, baby?

868
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:37,576
Did you bring it?

869
01:05:37,614 --> 01:05:38,706
Mm-hmm.

870
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:39,737
Let's see.

871
01:05:39,782 --> 01:05:41,909
What? Don't you trust me?

872
01:05:44,787 --> 01:05:46,755
Come on. Let's go
park down the street.

873
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:49,087
How can you think about sex
at a time like this?

874
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:50,251
Get in.

875
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:52,454
Not in your car again.
lt's too small.

876
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:55,257
Let's go inside then.

877
01:05:55,298 --> 01:05:56,822
My dad's home.

878
01:05:56,866 --> 01:05:58,527
Shit.

You're gonna get it.

01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:28,725
You're in fuckin' trouble.

889
01:06:28,765 --> 01:06:31,063
Come on. Come on.

Yeah.

896
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:24,519
A check?

897
01:07:24,554 --> 01:07:27,022
Yeah? So?

898
01:07:27,056 --> 01:07:29,047
Better not bounce.

899
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,553
Where's your condom?

900
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:34,256
Uh, l didn't bring one.

901
01:07:34,297 --> 01:07:35,855
What?

902
01:07:35,898 --> 01:07:38,298
Duh. You're already pregnant.

903
01:07:38,334 --> 01:07:40,131
Yeah, but other things.

904
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:42,399
Don't worry, baby. l'm clean.

905
01:07:42,438 --> 01:07:44,565
Besides, it's the only time
we'll be able to do it...

906
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:46,507
without having to worry about
anything. You know what l mean?

907
01:07:48,144 --> 01:07:49,577
What's wrong?

908
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:51,773
Nothing.

909
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:01,753
Oh...

910
01:08:39,095 --> 01:08:40,255
Huh?
