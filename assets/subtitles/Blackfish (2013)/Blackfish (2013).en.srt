1
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,693
Orange County Fire Rescue.

2
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,655
6600 Sea Harbor Drive.

3
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:26,907
SeaWorld Stadium.

4
00:00:27,074 --> 00:00:28,701
Okay.

5
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:31,870
We actually have a trainer in the water

6
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:33,871
with one of our whales--

7
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,874
the whale that they're not supposed
to be in the water with.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,875
Okay.
We'll get somebody en route.

9
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:40,420
Okay, through gate #3 to Shamu Stadium.

10
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:41,588
Gate 3.

11
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:51,014
Orange County Sheriff's Office.

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,932
We need SO to respond

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,268
for a dead person at SeaWorld.

14
00:00:56,811 --> 00:00:59,189
Uh, a whale has eaten one of the trainers.

15
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,194
A whale ate one of the trainers?

16
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:05,737
That's correct.

17
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:33,515
Do you believe?

18
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:35,850
My parents first brought me to a SeaWorld park

19
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:37,060
when I was very young.

20
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:42,191
From that point forward, I was hooked.

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,652
It meant everything to me because

22
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,780
I'd never wanted anything more.

23
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:50,240
I remember being probably
in first or second grade

24
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:52,366
watching National Geographic specials

25
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:53,701
or Mutual of Omaha specials

26
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:56,121
and seeing whales and seeing dolphins
and as a little kid

27
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:58,039
just being really incredibly inspired by it.

28
00:01:58,206 --> 00:01:59,750
I never went to SeaWorld.

29
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,501
I grew up in New York,
so I went to the Bronx Zoo.

30
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,921
Grew up on a lake with horses.
We'd swim the horses.

31
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:05,087
I grew up around the ocean.

32
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:07,965
I came from the middle of the country
in flatland Kansas.

33
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,134
I'm from Virginia.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,512
Traveled down, did the theme park thing

35
00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:14,389
in Orlando when I was 17

36
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:19,019
and saw the night show at Shamu Stadium.

37
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:22,021
Very emotional, you know, popular music.

38
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:25,943
And I was just-- I was very driven
to want to do that.

39
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:30,614
Then I saw what the trainers did...

40
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:33,449
and I said,
"That's what I want to do."

41
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:38,247
One of the trainers there, he goes,

42
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:40,122
"What are you doing out there?
You should be a trainer."

43
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:41,500
I go, "I don't know how to train animals.

44
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:42,876
I've never trained animals
in my life."

45
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:45,127
How do you prepare yourself for an encounter

46
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:48,048
with an 8,000-pound Orcinus orca?

47
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:50,759
I always thought
you needed, like, a master's degree

48
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:52,468
in marine biology to be a trainer.

49
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:55,889
It takes years of study and experience

50
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:58,307
to meet the strict requirements necessary

51
00:02:58,474 --> 00:03:01,353
to interact in the water with Shamu.

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,521
Come to find out, it really is more about

53
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:05,941
your personality and how good you can swim.

54
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:08,026
I went and tried out, got the job right away.

55
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:09,777
I'm like, "Yeah!"
So excited, you know.

56
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:11,905
I was so, so excited.

57
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:14,365
I really wanted to be there.
I really wanted to do the job.

58
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:16,993
I couldn't wait to get in the water
with the animals.

59
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,371
I really was proud of being a SeaWorld trainer.

60
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:22,415
You know, I thought this was
the most amazing job.

61
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:26,878
I showed up there on my first day,
not really knowing what to expect.

62
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:29,756
I was told to put on a wetsuit
and get in the water.

63
00:03:29,923 --> 00:03:31,091
Hi, Mom!

64
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:34,343
Oh, I was scared out of my wits.

65
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,263
First of all, I put my wetsuit on backwards

66
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,307
because I was raised on a farm in Virginia.

67
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:41,393
- Hi, Dad!
- My first thought

68
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,646
and memory of that time
was that dolphins are a lot bigger...

69
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:46,814
...heh, than they look

70
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:48,400
when you get in the water next to them.

71
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:51,069
Well, I watched the Sea Lion & Otter Show,

72
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:52,570
and this guy, Mike Morocco,

73
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:57,575
he comes out during the show
with a dress on as Dorky,

74
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:59,493
the alter ego of Dorothy--

75
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:02,830
in a dress with a sea lion,
the Coward Sea Lion, right?

76
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:04,415
And he's walking along with this little basket,

77
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:07,294
and I go, "I will never,
ever do that."

78
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:09,378
You know?
Two months later...

79
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:10,713
Hi, I'm Dorky!

80
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:14,884
Walking out onstage with a sea lion.

81
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:24,853
I was overwhelmed and I was so excited.

82
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:28,774
I mean, just seeing a killer whale...

83
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:31,360
is breathtaking.

84
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:36,406
I was just in awe.

85
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:38,992
It's shocking to see how large they are

86
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:40,326
and how beautiful they are.

87
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,579
Being in the presence of the killer whales

88
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:45,749
was just inspiring and amazing,

89
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:47,250
and I remember seeing them for the first time,

90
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:50,170
just not being able to believe
how huge they were.

91
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:55,466
You're there because you want to train
killer whales and that's your goal.

92
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:58,345
Yay!

93
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,012
I didn't know it was going to happen,

94
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,223
so I wasn't expecting it.

95
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:03,641
And one day they say,
"Okay, Sam, you're ready to go."

96
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:05,142
Come on, you got it.

97
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,646
"You're going to stand on the whale.

98
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:10,106
You're going to dive off the whale.

99
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:12,526
The whale's going to swim under you
and pick you up again.

100
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,319
And then you're going to do
a perimeter ride around the pool."

101
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:16,904
Good!

102
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:19,281
Keep moving.
Ride him to the slide-out.

103
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,786
They just told me to go do it and I did it.

104
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:26,122
Wow, I did-- I just rode
a killer whale.

105
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:30,459
Yay, girly!

106
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:36,632
When you look into their eyes,
you know somebody is home.

107
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,968
Somebody's looking back.

108
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:42,014
You form a very personal relationship
with your animal.

109
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,141
There's something absolutely amazing

110
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:49,103
about working with an animal.

111
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:50,980
You are a team.

112
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:52,983
You build a relationship together.

113
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:57,237
You both understand the goal
and you help each other.

114
00:05:57,403 --> 00:06:00,072
I've been with this whale
since I was 18 years old

115
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,035
and I've seen her have all four of her babies.

116
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:05,704
We've grown up together. Huh?

117
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,456
That's the joy I got out of it.

118
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:10,459
It's a relationship like I've never had.

119
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,144
Bro,
I have to know-- are you nervous?

120
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,728
I'm scared.

121
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:32,355
- Oh, no.
- Nice hair, Jeff.

122
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:38,278
Did you see anything?

123
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:41,238
Projection for the future of Jeff Ventre.

124
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:44,158
Jeff Ventre is going to go over there,
he's going to shine.

125
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:45,786
- You're going to notice...
- Dawn.

126
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,954
- Oh, that's Dawn.
- Wow.

127
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,122
He's going to be my supervisor one day.

128
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,792
There you go.

129
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:57,254
I knew Dawn when she was new.

130
00:06:57,422 --> 00:06:58,507
She was a great person to work with

131
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:02,343
and she obviously blossomed
into one of SeaWorld's best trainers.

132
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:03,845
This is Dawn Brancheau.

133
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:07,264
Dawn is the senior trainer
here at Shamu Stadium.

134
00:07:07,432 --> 00:07:10,268
I guess you could say
I kind of knew Dawn in a past life.

135
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:11,435
It's a tough job, isn't it?

136
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:13,814
Yeah, we really do go through
a lot of physical exertion.

137
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,315
You can see in the show
we do a lot of deepwater work,

138
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:19,360
breath holds, very high-energy
behaviors with animals.

139
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:21,153
Obviously they're giving out
a lot of energy too,

140
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,531
but we're working together
and having a lot of fun as well.

141
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:26,576
She's beautiful, she's blonde,
she's athletic, she's friendly.

142
00:07:26,742 --> 00:07:28,036
You know, everybody loves Dawn.

143
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:29,579
And I mean this so sincerely,

144
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:32,081
watching you perform yesterday--
you're amazing.

145
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:33,667
- Thank you.
- You really are.

146
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:37,629
She captured what it means
to be a SeaWorld trainer.

147
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:39,840
She had so much experience
that it made me realize

148
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:43,093
what happened to her
really could have happened to anyone.

149
00:07:49,891 --> 00:07:50,933
This is Detective Revere

150
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,185
with the Orange County Sheriff's Office.

151
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:54,812
Today's date is February 24, 2010.

152
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,105
The time is 4:16.

153
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:58,983
In the room with me right now
is a Thomas George Tobin.

154
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,610
- Is that correct?
- Correct.

155
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:22,548
- So the arm is nowhere...
- Right.

156
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:33,894
OSHA, on behalf of the federal government,

157
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,312
is basically suggesting that swimming with orcas

158
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,065
is inherently dangerous
and that you can't completely predict

159
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:42,735
the outcome when you enter the water
or enter their environment.

160
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:45,113
That's the crux of the OSHA case.

161
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:50,284
Stay out of proximity with the animals
and you won't get killed.

162
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:53,413
It will have a ripple effect
through the whole industry.

163
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,706
This was national headline news.

164
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:57,375
SeaWorld's whale performances

165
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,585
may never be the same.

166
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:00,879
Right now the theme park is arguing in court

167
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:02,547
to keep whale trainers in the water,

168
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:05,049
something OSHA says is extremely dangerous.

169
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:07,760
These are wild animals,
and they are unpredictable

170
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,178
because we don't speak whale.

171
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:10,931
We don't speak whale, we don't speak tiger,

172
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:12,724
we don't speak monkey.

173
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,683
And tempers flared between the two sides today

174
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,687
when OSHA's attorney suggested
that SeaWorld only made changes

175
00:09:17,854 --> 00:09:21,024
after trainer Dawn Brancheau's death
outraged the public.

176
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:23,567
OSHA doesn't want
the trainers going back in the water

177
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:26,863
without a physical barrier
between them and the whales.

178
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:31,076
Being in close proximity
to these top predators is too dangerous.

179
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:32,661
They won't then be getting in the water

180
00:09:32,826 --> 00:09:34,828
riding on the whales, things like that.

181
00:09:34,995 --> 00:09:38,250
If you were in a bathtub for 25 years,
don't you think you'd get

182
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:42,044
a little irritated, aggravated,
maybe a little psychotic?

183
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:48,509
The situation with Dawn Brancheau--
it didn't just happen.

184
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:49,760
It's not a singular event.

185
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:54,807
You have to go back over 20 years
to understand this.

186
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:08,279
It was a really exciting thing to do

187
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:10,865
and so everybody wanted to do it.

188
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:13,326
What were they telling you you were going to do?

189
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:17,871
Mm, capture orcas.

190
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:20,332
Whoo-hoo!

191
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,750
They had aircraft,

192
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,836
they had spotters, they had speedboats,

193
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:26,588
they had bombs they were throwing in the water.

194
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:31,469
They were lighting their bombs
with acetylene torches in their boats

195
00:10:31,635 --> 00:10:33,429
and throwing them as fast as they could

196
00:10:33,596 --> 00:10:36,349
to herd the whales into coves.

197
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:37,975
Whoo!

198
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:39,811
But the orcas had been caught before

199
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:41,645
and they knew what was going on

200
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:44,356
and they knew their young ones
would be taken from them.

201
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:49,611
So the adults without young
went east into a cul-de-sac

202
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:53,490
and the boats followed them,
thinking they were all going that way,

203
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:56,661
while the mothers with babies went north.

204
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:58,830
But the capture teams had aircraft.

205
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:01,541
And they have to come up for air eventually.

206
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:04,586
And when they did,
the capture teams alerted the boats

207
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:07,839
and said, "Oh, no, they're going north--
the ones with babies."

208
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:10,716
So the boats-- the speedboats
caught them there

209
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:12,384
and herded them in.

210
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:15,804
And then they had fishing boats with seine nets

211
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:18,975
that they would stretch across
so none could leave

212
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:21,519
and then they could just pick out
the young ones.

213
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:33,865
We were only after the little ones.

214
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:37,994
And a little one is, you know,
a big animal still.

215
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:40,455
But I was told because of shipping costs

216
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:43,082
that's why they only take the little ones.

217
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:48,879
They had the young ones
that they wanted in the corrals,

218
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:50,340
so they dropped the seine nets.

219
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:53,259
And all the others could have left,
but they stayed.

220
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:01,225
We're there, trying to get
the young orca into the stretcher,

221
00:12:01,393 --> 00:12:04,562
and the whole famn damily is out here,

222
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:06,563
25 yards away maybe,

223
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,024
in a big line...

224
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:12,111
...and they're communicating
back and forth.

225
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:13,779
Well...

226
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,743
you understand then what you're doing, you know.

227
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:25,917
I-- I lost it.

228
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,836
I mean, I just started crying.

229
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:31,213
I didn't stop working,

230
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,133
but I...

231
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:36,760
you know, I just couldn't handle it.

232
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:42,100
Just like kidnapping a little kid
away from their mother.

233
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:45,937
Everybody's watching.
What can you do?

234
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:50,316
It's the worst thing I can think of, you know?

235
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:53,068
I can't think of anything worse than that.

236
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:56,947
Now, and this really sounds bad,

237
00:12:57,115 --> 00:13:00,409
but when the whole hunt was over,

238
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:04,205
there were three dead whales in the net.

239
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:06,749
And...

240
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,961
so they had Peter and Brian and I...

241
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:16,216
cut the whales open, fill them with rocks,

242
00:13:16,384 --> 00:13:18,760
put anchors on their tail, and sink them.

243
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:22,432
Well...

244
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:25,643
you know...

245
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:29,605
really, I didn't even think about it

246
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:31,482
being illegal at that point.

247
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,775
I thought it was a PR thing.

248
00:13:34,777 --> 00:13:38,447
They were finally ejected
from the State of Washington

249
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:41,451
by a court order in 1976.

250
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:44,077
It was SeaWorld by name that was told,

251
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:47,456
"Do not come back to Washington
to capture whales."

252
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:51,793
Without missing a beat, they went
from Washington to Iceland

253
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,962
and began capturing there.

254
00:13:57,674 --> 00:14:00,636
I've been part of a revolution
and two change of presidents

255
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:03,096
in Central and South America...

256
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:08,186
and seen some things that's hard to believe,

257
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:11,648
but this is the worst thing
that I've ever done--

258
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:14,650
is hunt that whale.

259
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:54,274
Sealand has been
a part of Victoria for over 20 years.

260
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,318
We specialize in the care
and display of killer whales.

261
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,365
By the time I started, when he was four,

262
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:07,370
he was up to 16 feet long
and weighed 4,000 pounds.

263
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,081
Tilikum, up again.

264
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:12,667
Thank you.

265
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,128
I had actually seen Tilikum
quite a number of times.

266
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:18,380
He was right across the street here in Victoria.

267
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:20,549
Now, this show
can get a little bit soggy at times.

268
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:23,720
All Sealand was was a net hanging in a marina

269
00:15:23,885 --> 00:15:25,888
with a float around it.

270
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:30,183
Tilikum was the one
we really loved to work with.

271
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,187
He was very well behaved
and he was always eager to please.

272
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:37,609
When he was first introduced,
everything just went fine and dandy,

273
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:40,193
but the previous head trainer

274
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,864
used techniques that involved punishment.

275
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,118
He would team a trained orca up
with Tilikum who was untrained.

276
00:15:47,284 --> 00:15:49,953
He would send them both off
to do the same behavior.

277
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,790
If Tilikum didn't do it,
then both animals were punished.

278
00:15:53,957 --> 00:15:56,251
Deprived of food to keep them hungry,

279
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:59,212
this caused a lot of frustration
with the larger animal,

280
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:00,673
the established animal,

281
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,216
and would in turn get frustrated with Tilikum

282
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:05,802
and would rake him with his teeth.

283
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,971
There would be times during certain seasons

284
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,558
that Tilikum would be covered
head to toe with rakes.

285
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:14,479
Rakes are teeth on teeth and raking the skin.

286
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:16,480
And from head to toe you could see blood

287
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:20,400
and you could see scratches,
and he would just be raked up.

288
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,986
Both females would gang up on him.

289
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:24,697
Tilikum was the one we trusted.

290
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:27,075
We never were concerned about Tilikum.

291
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,411
The issue was really that we stored
these whales at night

292
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:33,748
in what we call a module,
which was 20 feet across

293
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:37,418
and probably 30 feet deep as a safety precaution

294
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:40,046
because we were worried about people
cutting the net and letting them go.

295
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:43,131
And the lights were all turned out,
so there was really no stimulation.

296
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:47,302
They're just in this dark,
metal 20x30-foot pool

297
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,721
for two-thirds of their life.

298
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:55,186
When we first started,

299
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:57,187
they were quite small and quite young.

300
00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:58,898
So they fit in there quite nicely,

301
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:01,942
but they were immobile for the most part.

302
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:06,489
It didn't feel good.
It just didn't.

303
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:08,532
And it was just wrong.

304
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,742
We started having difficulty getting them all

305
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,372
into this one small steel box, to be honest.

306
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:16,457
That's what it was.
It was a floating steel box.

307
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:18,334
That's where food deprivation would come in.

308
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,128
We would hold back food,

309
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:22,630
and they would know if they went in the module

310
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:23,798
that they would get their food.

311
00:17:23,964 --> 00:17:25,590
So if they're hungry enough,
they're going to go in there.

312
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:27,175
And during the winter that would be

313
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:30,555
from 5:00 at night
till 7:00 in the morning.

314
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:32,390
When you let them out,
you'd see these new tooth rakes

315
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:34,307
and sometimes you'd see blood.

316
00:17:34,474 --> 00:17:36,853
Closing that door on him

317
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,690
and knowing that he's locked in there
for the whole night is like...

318
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:45,486
it's a stab, it's a "whoa."

319
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:49,490
If that is true, it's not only inhumane,

320
00:17:49,656 --> 00:17:51,659
and I'll tell them so...

321
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:56,038
but it probably led to what I think
is a psychosis that...

322
00:17:57,582 --> 00:17:59,333
he was on a hair trigger.

323
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,251
He'd kill.

324
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:14,140
An employee is dead after an encounter...

325
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:17,143
...at a Canadian park
called Sealand of the Pacific.

326
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:20,020
The victim, Keltie Byrne,
was a championship swimmer

327
00:18:20,188 --> 00:18:22,105
and a part-time worker at Sealand.

328
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:25,692
As seen in this home video,
rescuers used a huge net to try...

329
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:28,488
...rescue workers' efforts
were hindered by the agitated whales.

330
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:30,781
I'd like to make
the Pan Pacific team this summer,

331
00:18:30,948 --> 00:18:35,243
but my more immediate goal
is just to swim fast at nationals.

332
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,836
It was sort of a cloudy, gray day

333
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:45,671
and we were looking for something to do,

334
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:48,089
so we thought,
"Why not go to Sealand?"

335
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:52,470
It was kind of like this dingy pool
with these whales and--

336
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:54,846
it just felt a little bit like an amusement park

337
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:58,893
that was kind of on its last legs
and everything was a bit gray.

338
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,811
Yeah. It was like
a swimming pool.

339
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:01,979
- Yeah, yeah.
- You know,

340
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:03,815
three whales in a swimming pool.

341
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,981
Yeah.

342
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:08,568
And they would come up
and touch the ball and there was--

343
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:12,030
I think there was some tail splashing
and there was some--

344
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:14,407
- Some jumping.
- The fish. And--

345
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:17,953
They hold the fish and the whales jump up.

346
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,374
I remember saying, "Oh, what a fun job.

347
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,961
You know, she's so lucky."

348
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:28,506
And then I saw her walking with her rubber boots

349
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:31,843
and she tripped and her foot
just dipped into the edge of the pool

350
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:34,470
and she lost her balance and fell in.

351
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:38,223
And then she was pushing her way up
to get out of the pool

352
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:40,893
and the whale zoomed over, grabbed her boot,

353
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:42,519
and pulled her back in.

354
00:19:42,686 --> 00:19:44,771
At first, I didn't think it was that serious

355
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:48,608
because you see the trainer
in the pool with the whale

356
00:19:48,776 --> 00:19:52,153
and you think, "Oh, well,
the whales are used to that."

357
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,865
And then all of a sudden,
it started getting--

358
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:58,368
there was more swimming,
more activity, more thrashing,

359
00:19:58,536 --> 00:20:00,288
and she was starting to get panicked.

360
00:20:00,453 --> 00:20:03,207
And then as it progressed,
you started to realize,

361
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:05,667
"Whoa, something's not right here."

362
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:08,712
She started to scream
and she started looking around

363
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,132
and her eyes were, like, bigger and bigger

364
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:13,925
and realizing that,
"I really am in trouble here."

365
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:17,137
And then they would pull her under.

366
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:19,181
And then they would come up
and then when she--

367
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:21,558
they came up, she'd be,
"Help me, help me."

368
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:23,059
And then they'd take her down again.

369
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:26,646
And she would be submerged for several seconds

370
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:29,066
up to, I don't know, maybe a minute.

371
00:20:29,232 --> 00:20:30,942
You're not keeping track.

372
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:36,656
So it was harder and harder
for her to get the air in

373
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:38,159
because she was screaming.

374
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:42,078
And my sister remembers
her saying, "I don't want to die."

375
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,630
Well, condolences to Keltie's family.

376
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:52,673
Yeah.

377
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,549
That we couldn't help her

378
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:56,676
was pretty wretched.

379
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:00,096
Sealand closed.
Well, it's probably a good thing.

380
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:03,558
I mean, it was a little pond.

381
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:05,560
And I think the owner,

382
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:09,648
you know, made the right decision
for whatever reasons.

383
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:12,359
I don't believe he's a bad guy, a bad man.

384
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:14,653
I think he was shocked by the whole affair, too.

385
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:17,615
The blush was gone from the business

386
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:21,076
and he decided that that was it.

387
00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:22,411
We should shut down.

388
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:25,413
No one ever contacted us.
There was an inquest.

389
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,000
No one ever asked us to say what happened.

390
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,211
- Yeah.
- You know, we just left.

391
00:21:31,378 --> 00:21:34,589
There was no big lawsuits afterwards
and there was no memorial.

392
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:39,177
And the only thing remaining
of Keltie Byrne is--

393
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:44,599
is what's left in the folks' minds
who recall the case.

394
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,769
So in the newspaper articles,

395
00:21:46,935 --> 00:21:49,814
the cause of death
was that she drowned accidentally,

396
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,192
but she was pulled under by the whale.

397
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:55,443
Well, there's a bit of smoke
and mirrors going on.

398
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:58,489
I mean, one of the fundamental facts is
is that none of the witnesses

399
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:02,451
were clear about which whale pulled Keltie in.

400
00:22:02,617 --> 00:22:05,162
Yes. Yeah, it was the large whale.

401
00:22:05,328 --> 00:22:08,374
Tilikum, the male, is the one
that went after her.

402
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,292
And the other two just kind of circled around.

403
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,753
But he was definitely the instigator.

404
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:18,174
And we knew it was that whale
because he had the flopped-over fin.

405
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:20,845
Like, it was very easy to tell.

406
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:29,060
Sealand of the Pacific closed
its doors and was looking, I guess,

407
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:30,520
to make a buck on the way out

408
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:32,772
and these whales are worth millions of dollars.

409
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,483
When SeaWorld heard that Tilikum was available

410
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:38,988
after this accident at Sealand of the Pacific,

411
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:41,699
they really wanted Tilikum
because they needed a breeder.

412
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:44,242
So I don't even think that anybody
even was questioning,

413
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,244
like, is this a good idea?

414
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:50,082
My understanding of the situation
was that Tilikum and the others

415
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:51,666
would not be used in shows.

416
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,419
They would not be performance animals.

417
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:54,920
Our understanding of their behavior

418
00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:57,714
was that it was such
a highly stimulating event for them

419
00:22:57,882 --> 00:22:59,299
that they were likely to repeat it.

420
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,178
Sealand was-- we were all young
and bit of sea cowboys

421
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:05,306
and we weren't so technical
and scientific as SeaWorld,

422
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,767
so we all had this vision
that they knew more than us

423
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:09,477
and they were better than us
and Tilikum would have

424
00:23:09,643 --> 00:23:11,186
a bigger pool and he'd have a better life

425
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:13,439
and he would have better care
and he'd have better food

426
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,648
and it'd be a great life for him.

427
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:18,277
So it was like, "Okay, Tilly.

428
00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:21,696
You're going to Disneyland.
Lucky you."

429
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:29,329
The orcas' intelligence

430
00:23:29,497 --> 00:23:31,832
may be even superior to man's.

431
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:35,211
As parents, they are exemplary,
better than many human beings.

432
00:23:35,376 --> 00:23:39,589
And like human beings, they have
a profound instinct for vengeance.

433
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:44,177
Dino De Laurentiis presents...

434
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:46,596
..."Orca."

435
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:51,434
If you go back only 35 years, we knew nothing.

436
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:52,853
In fact, less than nothing.

437
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:55,980
What the public had was superstition and fear.

438
00:23:56,147 --> 00:23:58,275
A fight to the death...

439
00:23:59,902 --> 00:24:02,613
between the two most dangerous animals on Earth.

440
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,323
What in hell are you?!

441
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,366
These were the vicious killer whales

442
00:24:06,534 --> 00:24:08,786
that, you know, had 48 sharp teeth

443
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:11,538
that would rip you to shreds
if they got a chance.

444
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:19,712
What we learned is that
they're amazingly friendly

445
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,550
and understanding and intuitively
want to be your companion.

446
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:25,845
Are you recording this?

447
00:24:28,763 --> 00:24:30,974
And to this day there is no record

448
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:34,228
of an orca doing any harm
to any human in the wild.

449
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:50,661
They live in these big families.

450
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:55,415
And they have life spans
very similar to human life spans.

451
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:59,252
The females can live to about 100, maybe more,

452
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,922
males to about 50 or 60.

453
00:25:02,088 --> 00:25:06,176
But the adult offspring never leave
their mother's side.

454
00:25:08,846 --> 00:25:13,392
Each community has a completely
different set of behaviors.

455
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:19,230
Each has a complete repertoire of vocalizations

456
00:25:19,397 --> 00:25:22,317
with no overlap.

457
00:25:22,483 --> 00:25:23,861
You could call them languages.

458
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:26,363
The scientific community is reluctant to say

459
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:29,074
any other animal but humans uses languages,

460
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,744
but there's every indication
that they use languages.

461
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:36,207
The orca brain just screams out

462
00:25:36,373 --> 00:25:38,709
intelligence, awareness.

463
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,544
We took this tremendous brain

464
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:44,214
and we put it in a magnetic
resonance imaging scanner.

465
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:48,301
What we found was just astounding.

466
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:51,387
They've got a part of the brain
that humans don't have.

467
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:54,974
A part of their brain has extended out

468
00:25:55,142 --> 00:25:57,936
right adjacent to their limbic system.

469
00:25:58,103 --> 00:26:00,855
The system processes emotions.

470
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:04,108
The safest inference would be these are animals

471
00:26:04,276 --> 00:26:08,446
that have highly elaborated emotional lives.

472
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:11,407
It's becoming clear that dolphins and whales

473
00:26:11,575 --> 00:26:14,912
have a sense of self, a sense of social bonding

474
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:17,413
that they've taken to another level--

475
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,084
much stronger, much more complex

476
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,003
than in other mammals, including humans.

477
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:26,382
We look at mass strandings,

478
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:29,593
the fact that they stand by each other.

479
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,887
Everything about them
is social-- everything.

480
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:37,433
It's been suggested
that their whole sense of self

481
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:40,980
is distributed among
the individuals in their group.

482
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:42,940
There are five of them.

483
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:47,027
These orca are going
to attack this seal on--

484
00:26:47,193 --> 00:26:51,906
they've been breaking the ice off
and swimming around him.

485
00:26:52,074 --> 00:26:53,826
Oh, here they come, two of them.
Lookit, underneath there.

486
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:55,493
You can see them underneath.

487
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:58,038
They made a big wave.
Look at that, a big wave.

488
00:26:58,204 --> 00:26:59,289
- Oh, yeah.
- Whoa.

489
00:26:59,455 --> 00:27:01,916
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God. No, no, no.

490
00:27:02,084 --> 00:27:04,420
Oh!
Oh, I can't stand it.

491
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:07,006
If you can't watch
the bullfight, you'd better leave.

492
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:09,924
Oh, yeah, here they go.
Look at this-- three of them.

493
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:11,926
Look at this. Look at this.

494
00:27:12,094 --> 00:27:13,804
Oh, God. Oh, no!

495
00:27:13,971 --> 00:27:15,471
- Oh, God!
- It's all over.

496
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:17,641
Nope, not quite.

497
00:27:17,807 --> 00:27:20,769
Yeah, it's all over.

498
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:22,688
It's all over.

499
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,413
The First Nations people
and the old fishermen on the coast,

500
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,166
they call them "blackfish."

501
00:27:43,334 --> 00:27:47,503
They're an animal that possesses
great spiritual power

502
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:50,089
and they're not to be meddled with.

503
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,763
I've spent a lot of time around killer whales

504
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,473
and they're always in charge.

505
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:02,519
I never get out of the boat,
I never mess with them.

506
00:28:04,438 --> 00:28:06,940
The speed and the power is quite amazing.

507
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,366
Rules are the same
as the pool hall--

508
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:19,494
keep one foot on the floor at all times.

509
00:28:23,414 --> 00:28:25,917
Even after seeing them thousands of times...

510
00:28:30,838 --> 00:28:32,715
you see them and you still--

511
00:28:32,883 --> 00:28:34,634
you know, wake up.

512
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,192
He arrived, I think, in 1992.

513
00:28:50,358 --> 00:28:52,693
I was at Whale and Dolphin Stadium
when he arrived.

514
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:57,115
And he's twice as large
as the next animal in the facility.

515
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:58,282
Yay!

516
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,826
The guy is right at about 12,000 pounds.

517
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:03,288
That's incredible.
He looks fantastic.

518
00:29:03,454 --> 00:29:05,582
When Tilikum arrived at SeaWorld,

519
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:10,711
he was attacked viciously,
repeatedly by Katina and others.

520
00:29:10,878 --> 00:29:14,298
In the wild, it's a very matriarchal society.

521
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:17,344
Male whales are kept at the perimeter.

522
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,054
In captivity,

523
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:23,392
the animals are squeezed
into very close proximity.

524
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:25,685
Tilikum-- the poor guy
is so large,

525
00:29:25,853 --> 00:29:29,480
he couldn't get away
because he just is not as mobile

526
00:29:29,647 --> 00:29:32,483
relative to the smaller and more agile females.

527
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:35,194
And where was he going to run?
There's no place to run.

528
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:37,865
I think he spent a lot of time in isolation.

529
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,491
SeaWorld claims that, "Oh, no,
he's always in with the other--

530
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:42,661
with the females," but from what I saw,

531
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:45,455
he was mostly put with the females
for breeding purposes

532
00:29:45,622 --> 00:29:49,710
and he didn't spend a lot of time,
you know, with the other whales.

533
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:53,337
It's for his own protection
that he gets beat up.

534
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:55,673
And so by segregating him,

535
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,804
it provides a physical barrier
so the females can't kick his butt.

536
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:03,598
Tilikum is pretty much kept in the back,

537
00:30:03,765 --> 00:30:08,103
and then brought out at the very end
as, like, the big splash.

538
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:15,234
He was always happy to see you in the morning.

539
00:30:15,402 --> 00:30:16,819
- Hi!
- There we go.

540
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:19,071
- You're the boy.
- Look at his chompers.

541
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:21,532
Maybe because he was alone,
maybe because he was hungry,

542
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,910
maybe because he just liked you--

543
00:30:23,076 --> 00:30:25,077
who knows what was going on in his head.

544
00:30:25,244 --> 00:30:27,413
You want to whistle?

545
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,541
-- All right, so he can talk to us.

546
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:32,169
- Yes.
- You don't say.

547
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:33,670
He's precious.
Yes?

548
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:35,047
That was really loud.
Terrific.

549
00:30:37,465 --> 00:30:39,300
- Come on, big boy.
- Show the pecs.

550
00:30:39,468 --> 00:30:41,802
He seemed to like to work.
He seemed to be interested.

551
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,347
He seemed to want to learn new things.

552
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:47,558
He seemed to be enjoying
working with the trainers.

553
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:52,396
He, for me, was a joy.

554
00:30:52,564 --> 00:30:54,273
He really responded to me and I--

555
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:57,236
you know, every day I went to work,
I was happy to see Tilly.

556
00:30:59,863 --> 00:31:02,950
- Boop!
- That's cute.

557
00:31:07,078 --> 00:31:09,288
You're being too cute.

558
00:31:09,455 --> 00:31:12,125
I never got the impression
of him while I was there

559
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:15,378
that, oh, my God, he's the scary whale.

560
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:16,547
Not at all.

561
00:31:16,712 --> 00:31:21,300
Maybe some of it's just our naiveté or whatever,

562
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:24,011
you know, because we weren't given

563
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:26,597
the full details of Keltie's situation.

564
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:28,182
Turn around.
Smile, buddy.

565
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:30,102
- Cheese.
- Yay!

566
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:32,729
I was under the impression
that Tilikum had nothing to do

567
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:35,190
with her death specifically,
that it was the female whales

568
00:31:35,356 --> 00:31:36,525
who were responsible for her death.

569
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:39,528
What I found really odd at first
was the way they were acting

570
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:41,529
around this whale and what they had told us

571
00:31:41,697 --> 00:31:43,906
seemed to me to be two different things.

572
00:31:44,074 --> 00:31:45,826
The first day he arrived, I remember

573
00:31:45,992 --> 00:31:48,662
one of the senior trainers
at SeaWorld, she--

574
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:51,914
Tilikum was in a pool
and she was walking over a gate,

575
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:54,710
and she had her wetsuit unzipped
and it was tied around her waist.

576
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,920
And she was making cooing noises and going,

577
00:31:57,086 --> 00:31:58,713
"Hey, Tilikum,
what a cute little whale."

578
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,633
And she was, like,
just kind of play-talking at him,

579
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:05,429
and one of the supervisors said,
"Get her out of there!"

580
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:07,931
And just screamed at her,
like, "Get her away from there,"

581
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:10,057
like they were so worried
that something was going to happen.

582
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:13,269
And I remember thinking,
"Why are you guys making

583
00:32:13,436 --> 00:32:16,189
such a big deal out of this
when he didn't actually kill her?"

584
00:32:16,355 --> 00:32:19,483
Well, clearly management thought
there was some reason

585
00:32:19,651 --> 00:32:21,444
to exercise caution around him.

586
00:32:21,612 --> 00:32:24,239
You know, clearly they knew more
than they were telling us.

587
00:32:25,574 --> 00:32:28,076
Ladies and gentlemen, the next two
behaviors you're going to be seeing,

588
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:30,494
you can only see right here at SeaWorld.

589
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:35,125
Jeff was out in the audience
filming one of the Shamu shows.

590
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,542
It was a perfect show.

591
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,961
All of the hot dog sequences,

592
00:32:38,127 --> 00:32:40,255
the water works sequences went off great.

593
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:45,301
I was really excited just to be capturing this

594
00:32:45,469 --> 00:32:48,137
because it was kind of turning out
to be a great show.

595
00:32:51,432 --> 00:32:53,809
A show that's kind of complete--

596
00:32:53,977 --> 00:32:57,730
it doesn't-- it probably only happens
a few times a week.

597
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:02,109
At the very end of the show,
Liz was working Tilikum

598
00:33:02,277 --> 00:33:04,363
and apparently Tilikum
lunged out of the water at her.

599
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:07,782
And I had captured Tilikum
coming out of the water

600
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:09,867
kind of turning sideways and appeared to me

601
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:11,452
to try to grab Liz.

602
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:13,622
And at that moment,

603
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:15,915
the tape became unusable.

604
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:19,336
I was just kind of basically instructed
to get rid of the tape.

605
00:33:19,502 --> 00:33:22,756
Wanting to kind of preserve the tape,
I actually used the editing equipment

606
00:33:22,923 --> 00:33:26,009
and snipped out
that little half-second or second

607
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:28,178
when he did that and stitched it back together

608
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:30,681
so it just kind of looked like
a glitch in the tape.

609
00:33:30,846 --> 00:33:32,807
And I'm like, "Look at this."
And it was like, "No.

610
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:34,393
This is no longer usable."

611
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:36,853
You know, and so we had to destroy the tape.

612
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:17,436
It's pretty outrageous that SeaWorld would claim

613
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:20,105
there was no expecting Tilikum
to come out of the water

614
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:22,065
because they had witnessed him
coming out of the water,

615
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:24,275
and it's written into his profile.

616
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:28,487
He lunges at trainers.

617
00:34:32,324 --> 00:34:35,369
When we visit SeaWorld,
we tend to take advantage of the fact

618
00:34:35,536 --> 00:34:39,081
that Shamu has been provided
with a safe and comfortable habitat.

619
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:41,168
And everything trained is an extension

620
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:44,086
of the killer whale's natural behavior.

621
00:34:44,253 --> 00:34:47,423
I spewed out the party line during shows.

622
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,342
I'm totally mortified now.

623
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:53,387
There was like-- something like,
"Look at Namu.

624
00:34:53,554 --> 00:34:56,307
Namu's not doing that
because she has to."

625
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:59,936
Namu is doing this because she really wants to.

626
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:01,730
Oh, my gosh.

627
00:35:01,896 --> 00:35:03,981
Like, some of the things I'm embarrassed by,

628
00:35:04,148 --> 00:35:05,358
so embarrassed by.

629
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,905
At the time, I think
I could have convinced myself

630
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,407
that the relationships that we had
were built on something

631
00:35:13,574 --> 00:35:16,369
stronger than the fact
that I'm giving them fish.

632
00:35:16,536 --> 00:35:18,038
You know, I like to think that...

633
00:35:20,123 --> 00:35:22,583
but I don't know that that's the truth.

634
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:29,215
I had been there a while and I had seen
a few other things along the way

635
00:35:29,382 --> 00:35:32,719
that made me question why I was there

636
00:35:32,885 --> 00:35:34,554
and what we were doing with these animals.

637
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:40,684
On November 4, 1988,

638
00:35:40,851 --> 00:35:43,271
a killer whale at SeaWorld

639
00:35:43,438 --> 00:35:46,900
gave the performance of a lifetime.

640
00:35:53,824 --> 00:35:56,451
Don't miss this small miracle.

641
00:35:56,617 --> 00:36:00,371
Come see our new Baby Shamu.

642
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:02,581
I know it was naive of me,

643
00:36:02,748 --> 00:36:04,543
but I thought that...

644
00:36:07,045 --> 00:36:09,213
it was our responsibility
to do as much as we could

645
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,007
to keep their family units together

646
00:36:11,173 --> 00:36:13,927
since we knew that in the wild
that's what happens.

647
00:36:14,094 --> 00:36:16,346
♪ Yes, sir, that's our baby... ♪

648
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,849
Kalina was the first Baby Shamu.

649
00:36:19,014 --> 00:36:21,601
Baby Shamu--
SeaWorld's newest star...

650
00:36:21,768 --> 00:36:26,188
She had become quite disruptive
and challenging her mom a little bit

651
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:28,858
and disrupting some shows
and that kind of thing.

652
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:30,902
♪ She's got the whole place jumpin' ♪

653
00:36:31,068 --> 00:36:34,280
♪ Shamu,
she's that baby whale. ♪

654
00:36:35,282 --> 00:36:37,117
It was decided by the higher-ups
that she would be moved

655
00:36:37,284 --> 00:36:40,161
to another park when she was
just four, four and a half years old.

656
00:36:40,327 --> 00:36:44,416
And that was news to us as trainers
that were working with her.

657
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:47,168
To me, it had never crossed my mind

658
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:51,088
that they might be moving the baby from her mom.

659
00:36:54,175 --> 00:36:57,846
The supervisors basically
was kind of mocking me,

660
00:36:58,012 --> 00:37:00,431
like, "Oh, you're saying, 'Poor Kalina,"'

661
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,934
you know, "'what's she going to do
without her mommy?"'

662
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:06,855
And, you know-- and that
of course just shut me up.

663
00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:11,067
So, the night of the move,
we had to deploy the nets

664
00:37:11,233 --> 00:37:15,195
to separate them and get Kalina,
the baby, into the med pool.

665
00:37:15,362 --> 00:37:18,490
And Katina was generally a quiet whale.

666
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:20,952
She was not an overly vocal whale.

667
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,246
After, Kalina was removed from the scene

668
00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:27,291
and put on the truck and taken to the airport,

669
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,960
and Katina, her mom, was left in the pool.

670
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:33,715
She stayed in the corner of the pool,

671
00:37:33,882 --> 00:37:37,719
like, literally just shaking and screaming,

672
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:38,969
screeching, crying.

673
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:41,264
Like, I had never seen her

674
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:42,891
do anything like that.

675
00:37:43,057 --> 00:37:44,976
And the other females in the pool,

676
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:46,518
maybe once or twice during the night

677
00:37:46,686 --> 00:37:48,355
they'd come out and check on her.

678
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:51,983
And she'd screech and cry
and they would just run back.

679
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:56,362
There was nothing that you could call that,

680
00:37:56,528 --> 00:37:59,532
watching it, besides grief.

681
00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:03,119
Those are not your whales.

682
00:38:03,286 --> 00:38:06,206
You know, you love them and you'll think,

683
00:38:06,373 --> 00:38:09,751
"I'm the one that touches them,
feeds them, keeps them alive,

684
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:12,211
gives them the care
that they need."

685
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:14,713
They're not your whales.

686
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,007
They own them.

687
00:38:17,384 --> 00:38:19,760
Kasatka and Takara were very close.

688
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:23,722
Kasatka was the mother, Takara's the calf.

689
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:25,724
Takara was special to me.

690
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:29,396
They were inseparable.

691
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:32,148
When they separated Kasatka and Takara,

692
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:34,192
it was to take Takara to Florida.

693
00:38:34,358 --> 00:38:38,737
Once Takara had already been
stretchered out of the pool,

694
00:38:38,905 --> 00:38:42,157
put on the truck, driven to the airport...

695
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:47,329
Kasatka continued to make vocals

696
00:38:47,496 --> 00:38:49,456
that had never been heard before.

697
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:51,291
They brought in

698
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:54,670
the senior research scientists
to analyze the vocals.

699
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:57,757
They were long-range vocals.

700
00:38:57,923 --> 00:39:00,385
She was trying something

701
00:39:00,552 --> 00:39:04,639
that no one had even heard before
looking for Takara.

702
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:06,349
That's heartbreaking.

703
00:39:07,976 --> 00:39:10,269
How can anyone

704
00:39:10,436 --> 00:39:15,150
look at that and think
that that is morally acceptable?

705
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:17,193
It's not.

706
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,362
It is not okay.

707
00:39:21,322 --> 00:39:22,865
Stand by, Dean.

708
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:24,617
Let's go live to SeaWorld

709
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:27,454
where Dean Gomersall
is joining us for a sneak peek.

710
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:29,621
Hi, Dean.
Tell us about the new show.

711
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:30,998
Good afternoon, Richard.

712
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,876
The new show is the Whale and Dolphin Discovery.

713
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:35,170
What it does is it shows
the relationship we have

714
00:39:35,335 --> 00:39:37,297
between all our animals here at the Whale...

715
00:39:37,463 --> 00:39:39,673
There's so many things that were told to us

716
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,967
that they tell us-- they tell you
so many times

717
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:43,552
that you just--
you start believing it.

718
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,429
So all the animals here get along very well.

719
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:47,389
It's just like training your dog, really.

720
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:49,976
I was blind, you know.
I was a kid.

721
00:39:50,143 --> 00:39:52,644
I didn't know what I was doing, really.

722
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:54,105
- Nice.
- Good job.

723
00:39:54,271 --> 00:39:55,981
You did a real good job.

724
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:05,867
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is David from Maryland.

725
00:40:06,034 --> 00:40:08,577
Go ahead and wave at everyone, David.

726
00:40:08,744 --> 00:40:11,581
I just really bought into what they told us.

727
00:40:11,748 --> 00:40:14,708
You know, I learned to say
what they told us to the audience.

728
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:15,876
Hello out there.

729
00:40:16,043 --> 00:40:18,045
Children are some of Shamu's biggest fans.

730
00:40:18,213 --> 00:40:20,047
We can do just about anything we want.

731
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:22,675
I thought I knew everything about
killer whales when I worked there,

732
00:40:22,842 --> 00:40:24,302
you know, and everything about these animals.

733
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:26,096
I really know nothing about killer whales.

734
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:28,389
I know a lot about being an animal trainer

735
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:30,266
or a killer whale trainer,
but I don't know anything

736
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:33,143
about these animals' natural history
or their behavior.

737
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:36,271
I really in some ways believed a lot
of what I was learning from them,

738
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:37,815
because why would they lie?

739
00:40:37,981 --> 00:40:43,612
Because the whales in their pools die young,

740
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:48,659
they like to say that all orcas
die at 25 or 30 years.

741
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:51,411
- 25 to 35 years.
- 25 to 35 years.

742
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:54,958
They're documented in the wild
living to be about...

743
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,876
35, mid-30s.

744
00:40:57,043 --> 00:40:59,003
They tend to live a lot longer
in this environment

745
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,630
because they have all the veterinary care.

746
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:02,422
And of course that's false.

747
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:06,927
We knew by 1980, after half a dozen
years of the research,

748
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:10,681
that they live equivalent to human life spans.

749
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:15,061
And every other potentially
embarrassing fact is twisted

750
00:41:15,228 --> 00:41:17,605
and turned and denied one way or another.

751
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:19,106
So, in the wild, they live...

752
00:41:19,273 --> 00:41:20,440
- Less.
- Less.

753
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:22,360
Like the floppy dorsal fins.

754
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:26,322
25% of whales have a fin
that turns over like that

755
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:27,657
as they get older.

756
00:41:27,824 --> 00:41:31,827
Dorsal collapse happens
in less than 1% of wild killer whales.

757
00:41:31,994 --> 00:41:32,996
We know this.

758
00:41:33,163 --> 00:41:38,126
All the captive males
100% have collapsed dorsal fins.

759
00:41:38,293 --> 00:41:41,753
And they say that they're a family,
that the whales are in their family.

760
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,338
They have their pods.

761
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:47,969
But that's just an artificial
assemblage of their collection,

762
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:51,347
however management decides they should mix them

763
00:41:51,514 --> 00:41:53,682
and whichever ones happen to be born

764
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:55,851
or bought and brought in.

765
00:41:56,018 --> 00:41:58,605
That's not a family, you know.
Come on.

766
00:41:59,938 --> 00:42:02,150
You've got animals
from different cultural subsets

767
00:42:02,317 --> 00:42:04,193
that have been brought in from various parks.

768
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
These are different nations.

769
00:42:05,527 --> 00:42:07,487
These aren't just two different killer whales.

770
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:10,240
These animals, they've got different genes,

771
00:42:10,407 --> 00:42:13,494
they use different languages.

772
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:17,623
Well, what could happen
as a result of them being

773
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:20,501
thrown in with other whales
that they haven't grown up with,

774
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:22,961
that are not part of their culture

775
00:42:23,128 --> 00:42:25,130
is there's hyperaggression...

776
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:30,762
...a lot of violence,
a lot of killing in captivity

777
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:34,097
that you don't ever see in the wild.

778
00:42:34,264 --> 00:42:36,351
For the health and safety of the animals,

779
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:38,728
please do not put your hands in the water.

780
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:40,605
It was always sort of this backdrop,

781
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:44,650
this underpinning of tension between animals.

782
00:42:44,817 --> 00:42:50,239
Whale-on-whale aggression was
just part of your-- the daily existence.

783
00:42:50,405 --> 00:42:54,284
We ask that you use
the stairs and aisleways as you exit.

784
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:56,579
Please do not step on the seats.

785
00:42:56,746 --> 00:42:58,581
These areas may become wet

786
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:01,041
and therefore slippery to some footwear.

787
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,210
Thank you.

In the wild, when there's tension,

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,715
they've got thousands of square miles

791
00:43:08,882 --> 00:43:12,594
to exit the scene and they can get away.

792
00:43:12,762 --> 00:43:15,264
You don't have that in captivity.

793

Could you imagine being in a small
concrete enclosure for your life

794
00:43:19,018 --> 00:43:21,603

796
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:28,318
Sometimes this aggression became very severe

797
00:43:28,485 --> 00:43:33,282
and, in fact, whales have died
in captivity because of this aggression.

798
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:34,701
I think it was 1988.

799
00:43:34,867 --> 00:43:37,619
Kandu, trying to assert
her dominance over Corky,

800
00:43:37,786 --> 00:43:39,579
rammed Corky.

801
00:43:39,746 --> 00:43:44,293
It fractured her jaw,
which cut an artery in her head

802
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,420
and then she bled out.

803
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:51,259
Now that's got to be a hard way to go down.

804
00:43:53,302 --> 00:43:56,639
I saw that there was just
a lot of things that weren't right.

805
00:43:56,806 --> 00:43:58,474
And there was a lot of it--
misinformation--

806
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:00,976
and something was amiss.

807
00:44:01,143 --> 00:44:04,063
And, you know, I sort of
compartmentalized that part of it

808
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,940
and did the best that I could
with the knowledge that I had

809
00:44:07,108 --> 00:44:08,985
to take care of the animals that were there.

810
00:44:09,152 --> 00:44:11,778
You know, I think all the trainers there
have the same thing in their heart.

811
00:44:11,945 --> 00:44:14,824
They're trying to make a difference
in the lives of the animals.

812
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:19,786
You think that, "if I leave,
who's going to take care of Tilikum?"

813
00:44:19,954 --> 00:44:23,081
That's why I stayed.
Because I felt sorry for Tilikum.

814
00:44:23,248 --> 00:44:25,083
I mean, if you want to get down
to the nuts and bolts of it,

815
00:44:25,251 --> 00:44:27,545
I stayed because I felt sorry for Tilikum.

816
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:31,590
And I couldn't bring myself to stop coming

817
00:44:31,757 --> 00:44:33,550
and trying to take care of him.

818
00:44:46,146 --> 00:44:48,023
Gosh, do I love coming out here every day

819
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:51,777
and having the audience just love
what we're doing with the animals.

820
00:44:51,943 --> 00:44:54,280
How do I make this animal
as beautiful as they are

821
00:44:54,447 --> 00:44:56,907
and have people walk away loving this animal?

822
00:44:57,074 --> 00:44:58,492
And they're touched and they're moved

823
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:01,371
and I feel like I made a difference to them.

824
00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:03,998
I left in January of 2010,

825
00:45:04,164 --> 00:45:06,708
a month before Dawn passed away.

826
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,295
She was like a safety guru.

827
00:45:10,463 --> 00:45:13,007
I mean, she was always
double-checking,

828
00:45:13,173 --> 00:45:14,842
making sure that everyone
was doing the right thing.

829
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:17,512
So I remember she would record
every show that she did

830
00:45:17,677 --> 00:45:20,222
and she would watch it and critique herself.

831
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:23,643
She was constantly trying to be better.

832
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:25,811
When I found out it was Dawn,

833
00:45:25,978 --> 00:45:28,231
I was shocked.

834
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:31,692
That could have been me.
I could have been the spotter.

835
00:45:31,858 --> 00:45:33,985
What if I was there and I could have saved her?

836
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:36,739
You know, all these things go through your mind.

837
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:50,836
John Sillick is the guy who, in 1987,

838
00:45:51,003 --> 00:45:54,297
was crushed between two whales
at SeaWorld of San Diego.

839
00:45:54,465 --> 00:45:57,677
Now, even though I'd been working
at SeaWorld for six months,

840
00:45:57,844 --> 00:45:59,594
I had no idea that that had even happened.

841
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:01,012
I never even heard that story.

842
00:46:01,179 --> 00:46:04,434
And the SeaWorld party line was that,
well, that was-- it was a trainer error.

843
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:06,476
It was John's fault.
You know, John's fault.

844
00:46:06,643 --> 00:46:08,186
He was supposed to get off that whale.

845
00:46:08,353 --> 00:46:11,106
And for years, I believed that
and I told people that.

846
00:46:19,157 --> 00:46:22,742
I actually started at SeaWorld, like,
five days after that event occurred

847
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:25,788
and we didn't--
we weren't told much about it

848
00:46:25,954 --> 00:46:29,083
other than it was trainer error.

849
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,335
And, you know, especially
when you're new into the program,

850
00:46:32,503 --> 00:46:33,753
you don't really question a whole lot.

851
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,007
Well, you know, years later,
when you actually look at the footage,

852
00:46:36,173 --> 00:46:38,134
you go, "You know what?
He didn't do anything wrong."

853
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,719
That whale just landed on him, you know.

854
00:46:39,885 --> 00:46:42,179
That whale just went to the wrong spot.

855
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:43,889
It could have been aggression.
Who knows?

856
00:46:44,056 --> 00:46:47,059
But it was not the trainer's fault
at all, watching that video.

857
00:46:51,771 --> 00:46:55,150
When I saw the video
of the killer whale landing on John,

858
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:56,860
I mean, it just absolutely took my breath away.

859
00:46:57,027 --> 00:46:58,028
L9aSped.

860
00:46:58,195 --> 00:46:59,237
I watched it two or three times,

861
00:46:59,405 --> 00:47:00,822
and every time I saw that, I just gasped.

862
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:02,407
I could not believe what I was seeing.

863
00:47:02,574 --> 00:47:04,367
What kept his body together is--

864
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:06,411
his wetsuit basically held him together.

865
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:07,954
But I know he's had multiple surgeries

866
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:10,248
and he's got tons of hardware in his body.

867
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:13,418
And it's hard for me to believe
that I didn't actually see that video

868
00:47:13,585 --> 00:47:15,795
while I was actually an animal trainer

869
00:47:15,963 --> 00:47:18,007
because it seems to me that every person

870
00:47:18,173 --> 00:47:20,592
who works with killer whales
should have to watch that video.

871
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:27,641
Tamarie--

872
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:29,893
you know, Tamarie made mistakes.

873
00:47:30,061 --> 00:47:33,231
The most important one
was interacting with whales

874
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:35,233
without a spotter.

875
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:39,362
So she's putting her foot on Orkid,

876
00:47:39,528 --> 00:47:40,987
she's taking her foot off.

877
00:47:41,155 --> 00:47:44,659
She's putting her foot on Orkid,
her rostrum, she's taking it off.

878
00:47:44,824 --> 00:47:47,411
Watching the video, knowing Orkid,

879
00:47:47,577 --> 00:47:51,123
your stomach drops because you know
what's probably going to happen.

880
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,668
She grabbed her foot.

881
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:57,003
Tamarie whips around and she grabs the gate.

882
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:59,840
You see herjust ripped from the gate.

883
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:04,427
At this point, Tamarie knows
that she's in trouble.

884
00:48:04,594 --> 00:48:05,887
She's under the water.

885
00:48:06,054 --> 00:48:08,056
Splash and Orkid both have her.

886
00:48:08,224 --> 00:48:09,891
She's totally out of view.

887
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:12,603
No other trainer knows that this is happening.

888
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:14,021
People start to scream.

889
00:48:14,188 --> 00:48:17,315
It was a park guest that was filming it.

890
00:48:17,483 --> 00:48:19,235
You hear-- you don't see her,

891
00:48:19,402 --> 00:48:22,905
but you hear Tamarie surface.

892
00:48:23,072 --> 00:48:26,576
You hear herjust scream out,
"Somebody help me."

893
00:48:26,742 --> 00:48:29,161
And the way she screamed it,

894
00:48:29,327 --> 00:48:30,829
it was just
such a bloodcurdling--

895
00:48:30,996 --> 00:48:34,083
like she knew she was going to die.

896
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:38,838
Robin-- when he ran over,
he made a brilliant decision.

897
00:48:39,005 --> 00:48:42,382
He told a trainer to run and take
the chain off Kasatka's gate.

898
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:46,177
By taking that chain off,
it would give the precursor to Orkid

899
00:48:46,344 --> 00:48:47,929
that Kasatka was coming in.

900
00:48:48,097 --> 00:48:51,016
Kasatka's more dominant than Orkid,

901
00:48:51,182 --> 00:48:54,061
so Orkid let her go.

902
00:48:54,228 --> 00:48:58,481
Her arm, it was U-shaped.

903
00:48:58,648 --> 00:49:00,860
It was compound fractured.

904
00:49:02,902 --> 00:49:06,114
She's very lucky to be alive, that's for sure.

905
00:49:19,503 --> 00:49:22,213
I believe it's 70 plus, maybe even more,

906
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,884
just killer whale trainer accidents.

907
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:29,387
Maybe 30 of them happened prior to me
being actually hired at SeaWorld.

908
00:49:29,554 --> 00:49:30,847
And I knew about none of them.

909
00:49:34,976 --> 00:49:37,771
I've seen animals come out at trainers.

910
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:44,235
Something's wrong.

911
00:49:44,402 --> 00:49:45,905
I've seen people get slammed.

912
00:49:58,876 --> 00:50:02,797
The whales, they're just playing or--
or they're upset for a second.

913
00:50:11,722 --> 00:50:13,849
It was just something that happened, you know?

914
00:50:14,016 --> 00:50:16,518
This culture of "You get back on the horse

915
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:18,396
and you dive back in the water.

916
00:50:18,561 --> 00:50:21,440
And if you're hurt, well, then we've got
other people that will replace you."

917
00:50:21,606 --> 00:50:24,025
And, "You came a long way.
Are you sure you want that?"

918
00:50:33,661 --> 00:50:35,788
A SeaWorld trainer is recovering today

919
00:50:35,954 --> 00:50:39,375
after a terrifying ordeal
in front of a horrified audience.

920
00:51:05,443 --> 00:51:08,987
For some reason,
the whale just took a different approach

921
00:51:09,155 --> 00:51:10,947
to what it was going to do

922
00:51:11,114 --> 00:51:14,409
with a very senior,
very experienced trainer, Ken Peters,

923
00:51:14,577 --> 00:51:16,286
and dragged him to the bottom of the pool

924
00:51:16,454 --> 00:51:18,079
and held him at the bottom.

925
00:51:19,914 --> 00:51:22,251
Let him go, picked him up,

926
00:51:22,418 --> 00:51:23,835
took him down again.

927
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:35,556
And these periods he was taken down
were pretty close to the mark.

928
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:39,518
You know, a minute, a minute 20.

929
00:51:44,063 --> 00:51:46,192
When he was at the surface, he didn't panic,

930
00:51:46,358 --> 00:51:48,027
he didn't thrash, he didn't scream.

931
00:51:48,193 --> 00:51:49,987
Maybe he's just built that way.

932
00:51:50,153 --> 00:51:52,864
But he stroked the whale.

933
00:51:56,994 --> 00:51:59,829
And the whale let go of one foot
and grabbed the other.

934
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:21,768
That's a pretty deep pool
and he took him right down.

935
00:52:21,936 --> 00:52:24,396
I think that's to two atmospheres of pressure.

936
00:52:24,563 --> 00:52:27,690
Apparently, Mr. Peters
is an experienced scuba diver

937
00:52:27,858 --> 00:52:29,443
and I think that knowledge probably contributed

938
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,528
to how he was able to be hauled down there

939
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:34,864
that quickly and stay calm and know what to do.

940
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:40,286
He knew what he was doing because
you can see him actually in the film.

941
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:42,121
It's-- the def is so good,
you can see him ventilating.

942
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:43,958
You can see him ventilating really hard.

943
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:47,210
So he knows about swimming
and diving and being underwater.

944
00:52:47,378 --> 00:52:50,672
He may have been assuming
he was going under again.

945
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,510
I did not walk away unimpressed
by his calm demeanor

946
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:57,471
during that whole affair.

947
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:02,851
I would be scared shitless.

948
00:53:21,286 --> 00:53:23,289
He was near to the end.

949
00:53:25,164 --> 00:53:29,711
Presumably, Ken Peters
had a relationship with this whale.

950
00:53:29,878 --> 00:53:32,380
Maybe he did.
Maybe that's what saved him.

951
00:53:32,547 --> 00:53:36,385
But Peters got the whale to let him go.

952
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,304
And they strung a net across.

953
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:52,483
And Ken Peters pulled himself
over the float line

954
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,570
and swam like a demon
to a slide-out

955
00:53:55,737 --> 00:53:58,449
because the whale was coming right behind him.

956
00:53:58,615 --> 00:54:00,951
The whale jumped over and came right after him.

957
00:54:01,117 --> 00:54:02,327
He tried to stand up and run.

958
00:54:02,494 --> 00:54:03,579
Of course, his feet were damaged.

959
00:54:03,746 --> 00:54:06,748
I mean, he just fell and he scrambled.

960
00:54:09,043 --> 00:54:10,920
And they take this as a prime example

961
00:54:11,085 --> 00:54:12,670
of their training working.

962
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:16,634
And they say, "Just stand back
and stay calm," and that did work.

963
00:54:17,675 --> 00:54:21,262
They claim this as a victory

964
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:23,389
of how they do business.

965
00:54:28,478 --> 00:54:31,773
And maybe so, but it can also be interpreted

966
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,485
as a hair's breadth away from another fatality.

967
00:54:42,284 --> 00:54:44,077
Hi, Shamu.
Hi, everybody.

968
00:54:44,244 --> 00:54:46,621
We're the Johnsons from Detroit, Michigan.

969
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:48,666
We sure had a great time
when we visited SeaWorld.

970
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,250
It's one of our favorite places.

971
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:53,670
Yeah, I like the part when Shamu
gets everybody wet.

972
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:55,965
When the whales get close to the glass

973
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,590
and start kicking out the water?

974
00:54:57,757 --> 00:54:59,342
Whamo!
You're a goner.

975
00:55:09,228 --> 00:55:13,231
Orange County's sheriff's deputies
have identified the 27-year-old man

976
00:55:13,398 --> 00:55:16,235
found dead in a killer whale's tank at SeaWorld.

977
00:55:16,402 --> 00:55:20,155
The victim is Daniel P. Dukes
from South Carolina.

978
00:55:20,322 --> 00:55:23,157
Dukes was found yesterday
draped over the back of Tilikum,

979
00:55:23,324 --> 00:55:26,161
the largest orca held in captivity.

980
00:55:26,327 --> 00:55:29,456
Well, all I know is
the public relations version of it--

981
00:55:29,623 --> 00:55:32,501
he was a young man that had been arrested

982
00:55:32,668 --> 00:55:35,295
not long before he snuck into SeaWorld.

983
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:37,130
Maybe he climbed the barbed wire fence

984
00:55:37,297 --> 00:55:40,509
around the perimeter and stayed after hours.

985
00:55:40,675 --> 00:55:44,137
Perfect story line--
a mentally disturbed guy

986
00:55:44,304 --> 00:55:47,141
hides in the park after hours
and strips his clothes off

987
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:50,393
and decides he wants to have
a magical experience with an orca

988
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:53,438
and drowns because he became hypothermic.

989
00:55:53,605 --> 00:55:55,481
Right.
So that's the story line

990
00:55:55,648 --> 00:55:57,443
and none of us were there
to know the difference.

991
00:55:57,608 --> 00:56:01,155
He was not detected by the night watch trainers

992
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,364
who were presumably at that station.

993
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:05,367
There are cameras all over SeaWorld.

994
00:56:05,534 --> 00:56:07,786
There are cameras all over
the back of Shamu Stadium

995
00:56:07,952 --> 00:56:08,954
pointing every which way.

996
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:11,206
There are underwater cameras.

997
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:15,251
I find it hard to believe
that nobody knew until the morning

998
00:56:15,418 --> 00:56:17,253
that there was a body in there.

999
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,048
They have a night watch trainer every night.

1000
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:23,217
That person didn't hear
any splashing or screaming?

1001
00:56:23,385 --> 00:56:26,722
I mean, I just find that really suspicious.

1002
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:28,181
One of the employees--

1003
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:30,266
I don't know if it was
a physical therapist or somebody--

1004
00:56:30,434 --> 00:56:34,688
was coming in in the morning
and there was Tilikum,

1005
00:56:34,855 --> 00:56:37,608
you know, with a dead guy,
a dead, naked guy on his back,

1006
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:41,820
kind of parading him around the back pool.

1007
00:56:41,987 --> 00:56:44,614
The public relations spin on this was that

1008
00:56:44,782 --> 00:56:48,327
he was kind of a drifter
and died of hypothermia.

1009
00:56:48,494 --> 00:56:52,164
But the medical examiner reports

1010
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:54,333
were more graphic than that.

1011
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,126
For example, Tilikum stripped him,

1012
00:56:57,293 --> 00:56:58,795
bit off his genitals.

1013
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:01,380
There was bite marks all over his body.

1014
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:05,469
Now, whether that was post-death
or pre-death, I don't know.

1015
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:08,262
But, yeah, all I can comment on

1016
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:11,391
is that the guy definitely
jumped in the wrong pool.

1017
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:21,275
So why keep Tilikum there?

1018
00:57:21,443 --> 00:57:24,153
This guy, he has a proven
track record of killing people.

1019
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,074
He's clearly a liability to the institution.

1020
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,159
Why keep him around?
Well, it's quite simple to answer.

1021
00:57:30,327 --> 00:57:32,663
And that is that his semen
is worth a lot of money.

1022
00:57:42,422 --> 00:57:44,298
Over the years, Tilikum has been

1023
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:47,177
one of the main breeding whales at SeaWorld.

1024
00:57:50,931 --> 00:57:53,934
It's brilliant because they can
inseminate way more female whales,

1025
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:56,103
because they can just
get his sperm and freeze it.

1026
00:57:56,269 --> 00:57:58,313
And then he's basically
operating as a sperm bank.

1027
00:58:00,106 --> 00:58:02,400
In a reputable breeding program, rule number one

1028
00:58:02,568 --> 00:58:05,362
is you certainly would not breed
an animal that has shown

1029
00:58:05,528 --> 00:58:08,197
a history of aggression towards humans.

1030
00:58:08,364 --> 00:58:11,367
Imagine if you had a pit bull who had killed.

1031
00:58:11,534 --> 00:58:13,536
That animal would have likely been put down.

1032
00:58:13,704 --> 00:58:15,581
But in the entire
SeaWorld collection--

1033
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:19,126
it's like 54% of the whales
in SeaWorld's collection

1034
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:22,003
now have Tilikum's genes.

1035
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:38,061
The fall is to assume that
all killer whales are like Tilikum.

1036
00:58:38,228 --> 00:58:40,188
You have to look at their
learning history from birth.

1037
00:58:40,355 --> 00:58:43,817
You have to understand why Tilikum was a hazard

1038
00:58:43,983 --> 00:58:45,568
to anybody in the water.

1039
00:58:45,735 --> 00:58:48,947
And you have to understand that none
of the other killer whales at SeaWorld

1040
00:58:49,114 --> 00:58:50,364
that are in that system are that way.

1041
00:58:50,532 --> 00:58:52,992
What about the incident at Loro Parque?

1042
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:54,619
First of all, I-- I can't--

1043
00:58:54,786 --> 00:58:58,831
I can't speak with specificity
about Loro Parque.

1044
00:58:58,998 --> 00:59:00,918
I wasn't there.

1045
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:03,295
In fact, I know very little about it.

1046
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:05,922
Probably about as much
as the general public knows.

1047
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:11,612
Loro Parque, it's in the Canary Islands,

1048
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,907
which is an autonomous region of Spain.

1049
01:00:14,074 --> 01:00:17,119
It's the largest tourist attraction
in all of Spain.

1050
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:25,668
And when SeaWorld sent the orcas to Loro Parque,

1051
01:00:25,835 --> 01:00:28,255
everybody was always questioning,

1052
01:00:28,422 --> 01:00:33,427
like, how did they make
that leap to send four young orcas

1053
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:36,554
to a park off the west coast of Africa

1054
01:00:36,722 --> 01:00:41,434
with trainers who-- a lot of them
had never been around orcas before?

1055
01:00:43,561 --> 01:00:45,313
Nothing was ready.

1056
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,856
The venue wasn't ready.

1057
01:00:47,023 --> 01:00:50,485
It wasn't ready for the orcas,
it wasn't ready for a show.

1058
01:00:50,652 --> 01:00:53,155
The owner of the park
didn't want to lose revenue

1059
01:00:53,322 --> 01:00:55,782
by shutting down the pools and repairing them.

1060
01:00:55,949 --> 01:00:57,951
So for three years, the animals ate the pools

1061
01:00:58,117 --> 01:01:00,119
and for three years
the animals had problems--

1062
01:01:00,286 --> 01:01:02,956
with their teeth, with their stomachs.

1063
01:01:03,123 --> 01:01:04,583
So that's the reason why these animals

1064
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,793
are enduring the endoscope procedures.

1065
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:10,213
Back up.
Now back up, back up.

1066
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,257
Those are still SeaWorld's animals

1067
01:01:12,423 --> 01:01:14,717
and they are responsible for those animals.

1068
01:01:24,643 --> 01:01:27,438
Loro Parque doesn't have a good reputation.

1069
01:01:27,606 --> 01:01:31,318
People that work in the business
know the reputation of places

1070
01:01:31,485 --> 01:01:34,570
and Loro Parque does not have a good reputation.

1071
01:01:34,737 --> 01:01:37,865
They didn't spend the same amount
of time as the SeaWorld trainers,

1072
01:01:38,032 --> 01:01:39,951
did not go through the same regimen

1073
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:42,913
that the SeaWorld trainers went through.

1074
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:45,706
You know, and Alexis really was
the best trainer.

1075
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:48,876
And I did say-- I said,
"You're the only trainer there

1076
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:52,422
that can hold his own
with a SeaWorld trainer."

1077
01:01:52,588 --> 01:01:54,925
And I said, "But you need
to be careful."

1078
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,543
Anywhere along the line
it could have been stopped

1079
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:33,295
because everyone knew
it was a tragedy waiting to happen.

1080
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:36,007
But no one ever did anything about it.

1081
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:37,509
And in the end,

1082
01:02:37,675 --> 01:02:40,594
it was the best trainer who lost his life.

1083
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:00,943
Those were SeaWorld's whales.

1084
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,487
They were trained using SeaWorld's techniques.

1085
01:05:04,572 --> 01:05:08,867
And their training was being supervised
at the time of the fatal accident

1086
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:13,123
by one of their senior trainers from San Diego.

1087
01:05:35,103 --> 01:05:38,398
For somebody to get up and say in a court of law

1088
01:05:38,565 --> 01:05:41,985
they have no knowledge of the linkages

1089
01:05:42,152 --> 01:05:46,197
between SeaWorld
and this park in Tenerife is well--

1090
01:05:46,364 --> 01:05:49,576
either she doesn't know and is telling the truth

1091
01:05:49,742 --> 01:05:51,994
or it's just a bold-faced lie.

1092
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:59,335
As trainers, we never forget
Shamu's true potential.

1093
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:01,295
We see it each and every day.

1094
01:06:01,463 --> 01:06:05,175
That's why all of our interactions
are very carefully thought out,

1095
01:06:05,342 --> 01:06:07,427
especially our water work interaction.

1096
01:06:07,594 --> 01:06:09,094
Whoa!

1097
01:06:16,728 --> 01:06:18,938
You big dork.

1098
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:21,065
Especially our water work interactions

1099
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:23,943
because they're potentially the most dangerous.

1100
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:27,739
I'd been expecting it
since the second person was killed.

1101
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:31,117
I'd been expecting somebody
to be killed by Tilikum.

1102
01:06:31,284 --> 01:06:32,911
I'm surprised it took as long as it did.

1103
01:06:33,077 --> 01:06:35,121
First tonight,
a six-ton killer whale

1104
01:06:35,288 --> 01:06:37,956
has lived up to its name,
killing an experienced trainer

1105
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:40,251
at SeaWorld, Orlando, today.

1106
01:06:40,418 --> 01:06:41,878
A tourist at an earlier show

1107
01:06:42,045 --> 01:06:43,880
said the animal seemed agitated.

1108
01:06:44,047 --> 01:06:47,175
Trainers complained
the whales weren't cooperating.

1109
01:06:47,342 --> 01:06:49,469
The whole show, the main show,

1110
01:06:49,635 --> 01:06:51,512
was a disaster that day.

1111
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:53,847
There was, you know, whales chasing each other

1112
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:56,351
and eventually the trainers decided
that they had to stop the show

1113
01:06:56,518 --> 01:06:58,353
because they couldn't
get the whales under control.

1114
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:00,730
Tilikum was in the back pool

1115
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:05,735
set up to do a Dine with Shamu
performance with Dawn.

1116
01:07:05,902 --> 01:07:09,322
Likely she saw what had gone on
during the main show

1117
01:07:09,489 --> 01:07:13,034
and so she had probably felt
more pressure to do a good show.

1118
01:07:14,827 --> 01:07:16,663
Yay!

1119
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:18,789
When you watch the whole video, you can see

1120
01:07:18,956 --> 01:07:21,626
that Tilikum is actually really with Dawn

1121
01:07:21,793 --> 01:07:23,545
in the beginning of the video.

1122
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:28,717
There's a couple of behaviors
that she asks him to do

1123
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:30,844
where Tilikum justjumps right in

1124
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:33,387
and he does exactly what she asks him to do.

1125
01:07:39,643 --> 01:07:41,521
There seemed to be a point in the session

1126
01:07:41,688 --> 01:07:43,981
where things went south, so to speak.

1127
01:07:44,148 --> 01:07:45,692
And in my humble opinion,

1128
01:07:45,858 --> 01:07:49,320
it was at that missed bridge--
whistle bridge,

1129
01:07:49,487 --> 01:07:51,364
on the perimeter pec wave.

1130
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:54,074
She asked him to do a perimeter pec wave

1131
01:07:54,242 --> 01:07:57,954
where she asked him to basically
go all the way around the pool

1132
01:07:58,121 --> 01:07:59,706
and wave his pectoral flipper.

1133
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:04,960
And she blows her whistle...

1134
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:06,628
- There we go.
- ...which is a bridge,

1135
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:08,840
which tells the animal that, okay,
you've done a good job.

1136
01:08:09,007 --> 01:08:10,132
Come back and get food.

1137
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,010
But he missed that cue.

1138
01:08:13,219 --> 01:08:15,554
He likes waving so much.
That's beyond waving.

1139
01:08:15,722 --> 01:08:17,890
And he went all the way around the pool

1140
01:08:18,056 --> 01:08:19,850
on this perimeter pec wave.

1141
01:08:20,018 --> 01:08:21,935
That's all right.
We're going to let him keep on waving.

1142
01:08:23,354 --> 01:08:25,689
My interpretation is that
he didn't hear the whistle.

1143
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:28,318
So not only did he not hear the bridge,

1144
01:08:28,484 --> 01:08:30,987
then he went and did
a perfect behavior and came back,

1145
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:34,698
and what he got was what we call
a three-second neutral response,

1146
01:08:34,865 --> 01:08:36,242
which is just a way to let the animal know,

1147
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:37,827
"No, you didn't do the correct thing.

1148
01:08:37,993 --> 01:08:40,287
You're not going to get rewarded.
And then we're going to move on."

1149
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:41,831
And then you can also see through the video

1150
01:08:41,997 --> 01:08:44,000
that Dawn is running out of food.

1151
01:08:45,126 --> 01:08:46,668
The animals can sense

1152
01:08:46,836 --> 01:08:48,962
when you're getting to the bottom
of your bucket of fish,

1153
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:51,341
because they can hear the ice clanging around

1154
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:53,967
and the kind of fishy, soupy water
at the bottom.

1155
01:08:54,135 --> 01:08:57,721
And the handfuls of fish that
they're getting delivered by the trainer

1156
01:08:57,889 --> 01:08:59,181
are all getting smaller.

1157
01:08:59,349 --> 01:09:02,351
So they know that they're coming down
to the end of session.

1158
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:04,813
When you see the difference
between the beginning of the video

1159
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:06,605
and the end of the video, you can see

1160
01:09:06,773 --> 01:09:10,193
that he's just not quite on his game anymore.

1161
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:11,485
There was no food left.

1162
01:09:11,653 --> 01:09:14,447
She kept asking him for more and more behaviors.

1163
01:09:14,613 --> 01:09:16,323
He wasn't getting reinforced for the behaviors

1164
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:17,617
that he was doing correctly.

1165
01:09:17,783 --> 01:09:20,828
He probably was frustrated towards the end.

1166
01:09:22,622 --> 01:09:25,958
Then she walked around the perimeter of G pool.

1167
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,836
He followed her.

1168
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:35,969
And then continued over
into the rocky ledge area

1169
01:09:36,135 --> 01:09:40,430
where she laid down with him
to do a relationship session,

1170
01:09:40,597 --> 01:09:43,518
which is--
it's quiet time, basically.

1171
01:09:43,685 --> 01:09:46,395
Tilikum at some point
grabbed ahold of her left forearm

1172
01:09:46,563 --> 01:09:49,314
and started to drag her
and eventually did a barrel roll

1173
01:09:49,481 --> 01:09:51,109
and pulled her in.

1174
01:09:51,275 --> 01:09:54,069
It may have started as play or frustration

1175
01:09:54,237 --> 01:09:58,783
and clearly escalated to be
very violent behavior

1176
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:01,493
that I think was anything but play.

1177
01:10:01,661 --> 01:10:03,997
In the end, he basically

1178
01:10:04,162 --> 01:10:06,373
just completely mutilated that poor girl.

1179
01:10:09,586 --> 01:10:13,756
They were gathering
all of the trainers at the Texas park.

1180
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:18,051
He said, "There's been an accident

1181
01:10:18,219 --> 01:10:21,180
at the Florida park
and a trainer was killed."

1182
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:25,435
Hearing that it was Dawn,
I was-- I couldn't believe it.

1183
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:27,604
I just remember saying to myself, "Not Dawn.

1184
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:29,396
It can't be Dawn."

1185
01:10:29,564 --> 01:10:33,943
He said that--
"And he still has her."

1186
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,863
And I just...

1187
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:39,157
was so disturbed by that

1188
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:43,619
and the reality of how powerless we are.

1189
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:47,122
Avulsion, laceration, abrasion, fractures.

1190
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:49,792
Fractures and associated hemorrhages.

1191
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:52,545
Blunt force traumas

1192
01:10:52,712 --> 01:10:55,047
to the main body, to the extremities.

1193
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:59,761
To see this meted out against a trainer...

1194
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:02,721
and I cannot fathom the reason.

1195
01:11:02,889 --> 01:11:05,140
It's shocking.

1196
01:11:05,307 --> 01:11:09,145
The lawyer for OSHA asked me
what I thought we'd learned,

1197
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,979
and I'm sitting in the courtroom

1198
01:11:11,146 --> 01:11:15,109
and I've got the Keltie Byrne
case file in one hand

1199
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:17,028
and I've got Dawn Brancheau in the other.

1200
01:11:17,194 --> 01:11:19,154
And they're almost, to the day, 20 years apart.

1201
01:11:19,322 --> 01:11:21,198
And I'm looking at these two things.

1202
01:11:21,365 --> 01:11:23,868
My only answer is, "Nothing."

1203
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:26,078
In fact, it's not a damn thing.

1204
01:11:26,244 --> 01:11:27,497
We have not learned a damn thing

1205
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:30,582
for something like that
to happen 20 years apart.

1206
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,543
Could you tell
if it was an accident or if this--

1207
01:11:33,711 --> 01:11:35,837
Did this female trainer
work with this whale on a regular basis?

1208
01:11:36,005 --> 01:11:39,384
I don't know. What apparently happened
is we had a female trainer

1209
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,135
back in the whale holding area.

1210
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:43,595
She apparently slipped or fell into the tank

1211
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:46,140
and was fatally injured by one of the whales.

1212
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:48,600
At first, SeaWorld reported
that a trainer slipped

1213
01:11:48,768 --> 01:11:51,145
and fell in the water and was drowned.

1214
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:52,814
So that was the first report.

1215
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,440
It wasn't until eyewitness
accounts disputed that

1216
01:11:55,608 --> 01:11:56,859
that they had to go back in their huddle

1217
01:11:57,025 --> 01:11:58,778
and say, "Wait a minute.
We gotta come up with a new plan."

1218
01:11:58,944 --> 01:12:00,488
New tonight--
SeaWorld has confirmed

1219
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:03,240
the killer whale pulled
the woman into the water.

1220
01:12:03,408 --> 01:12:04,951
She didn't fall into the tank

1221
01:12:05,118 --> 01:12:07,578
as the sheriff's department initially reported.

1222
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:10,872
The new plan is that he grabbed her ponytail.

1223
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:14,793
This is a subtle way of placing
the blame on Dawn's shoulders.

1224
01:12:14,961 --> 01:12:16,753
She shouldn't have had a long ponytail,

1225
01:12:16,921 --> 01:12:19,506
or if she did have that ponytail,
it should have been up in a bun.

1226
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:21,926
Dawn, if she was standing here
with me right now,

1227
01:12:22,092 --> 01:12:25,430
would tell you that it was her mistake

1228
01:12:25,595 --> 01:12:27,347
in allowing that to happen.

1229
01:12:27,515 --> 01:12:29,516
They blamed her.

1230
01:12:29,684 --> 01:12:31,685
How dare you?

1231
01:12:31,853 --> 01:12:35,605
How disrespectful for you to blame her

1232
01:12:35,773 --> 01:12:39,109
when she's not even alive to defend herself.

1233
01:12:39,277 --> 01:12:41,487
He grabbed her ponytail
and pulled her into the water.

1234
01:12:41,654 --> 01:12:43,113
That's as simple as it gets.

1235
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,365
There are photographs
of plenty of other trainers

1236
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:47,326
doing exactly the same thing that she was doing,

1237
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:51,872
so I knew that SeaWorld was lying
about the fact that this was her fault.

1238
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:55,752
The ponytail, in all likelihood, is just a tale.

1239
01:12:57,211 --> 01:13:00,965
The safety spotter, who apparently
didn't actually see the takedown,

1240
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:02,132
came up with that.

1241
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,926
- Are you excited?
- Yeah!

1242
01:13:05,094 --> 01:13:06,762
During the spotter's testimony,

1243
01:13:06,929 --> 01:13:09,806
OSHA pushed him to say
that he wasn't really sure

1244
01:13:09,974 --> 01:13:12,268
that it was her ponytail
that was in the whale's mouth,

1245
01:13:12,435 --> 01:13:16,189
that he just saw her underwater
and he assumed it was the ponytail.

1246
01:13:16,354 --> 01:13:18,315
OSHA contends that the whale came up

1247
01:13:18,483 --> 01:13:20,193
and grabbed Dawn Brancheau's arm,

1248
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:22,319
saying that that was another level
of aggressiveness.

1249
01:13:22,487 --> 01:13:25,489
And again, SeaWorld is saying
it was not an aggressive move.

1250
01:13:25,655 --> 01:13:27,783
One of SeaWorld's top curators, Chuck Tompkins,

1251
01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:30,078
said when Dawn Brancheau
was pulled off that ledge,

1252
01:13:30,243 --> 01:13:33,288
it wasn't necessarily
aggressive behavior by the whale.

1253
01:13:33,456 --> 01:13:37,042
The initial grab was not an act of aggression.

1254
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:39,420
This is not a crazed animal.

1255
01:13:39,587 --> 01:13:41,797
The industry has a vested interest
in spinning these

1256
01:13:41,963 --> 01:13:44,425
so that the animals continue to appear

1257
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:47,970
like cuddly teddy bears
that are completely safe.

1258
01:13:48,136 --> 01:13:49,971
You know, that sells a lot of Shamu dolls,

1259
01:13:50,139 --> 01:13:54,143
it sells a lot of tickets at the gate,
and that's the story line

1260
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:57,354
that they're going to continue
to stick with for as long as they can.

1261
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:19,836
Recognize that those that say
this is a crazed animal

1262
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:23,005
that acted out and grabbed Dawn maliciously,

1263
01:14:23,171 --> 01:14:28,552
they want to prove the theorem
that captivity makes animals crazy.

1264
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,345
And that is just false.

1265
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:32,931
All whales in captivity have a bad life.

1266
01:14:33,099 --> 01:14:34,766
They're all emotionally destroyed.

1267
01:14:34,934 --> 01:14:37,854
They're all psychologically traumatized,

1268
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:40,689
so they are ticking time bombs.

1269
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:42,233
It's not just Tilikum.

1270
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:44,819
We have to separate
what happened to Dawn--

1271
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:48,113
and, as tragic as it is, no one wants
to ever see it happen again.

1272
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,490
Can SeaWorld create an environment

1273
01:14:50,658 --> 01:14:51,951
where it never happens again?

1274
01:14:52,118 --> 01:14:54,162
Yes, I absolutely believe they can.

1275
01:14:57,539 --> 01:14:59,708
What if there were no SeaWorlds?

1276
01:14:59,876 --> 01:15:03,087
I can't imagine a society, with the value we put

1277
01:15:03,253 --> 01:15:05,797
on marine mammals, if those parks didn't exist.

1278
01:15:05,965 --> 01:15:09,635
I'm not at all interested in having my daughter,

1279
01:15:09,801 --> 01:15:11,386
who is three and a half,

1280
01:15:11,554 --> 01:15:14,347
grow up thinking that it's normalized

1281
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:17,393
to have these intelligent,
highly evolved animals

1282
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,728
in concrete pools.

1283
01:15:18,895 --> 01:15:21,439
I don't want her to think
that's how we treat the kin

1284
01:15:21,605 --> 01:15:24,524
that we find ourselves around on this planet.

1285
01:15:24,692 --> 01:15:26,194
I think it's atrocious.

1286
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:27,944
This hearing is expected to last all week

1287
01:15:28,112 --> 01:15:30,989
with OSHA continuing to work
toward this theory--

1288
01:15:31,157 --> 01:15:34,659
that SeaWorld knew there was
a calculated risk of injury or death,

1289
01:15:34,827 --> 01:15:37,787
but put trainers in the water
with the whales anyway,

1290
01:15:37,954 --> 01:15:40,082
while SeaWorld will say
that Dawn Brancheau's death

1291
01:15:40,248 --> 01:15:42,001
was an isolated incident.

1292
01:15:42,167 --> 01:15:45,128
Reporting live in Seminole County,
Dave McDaniel, WESH 2 News.

1293
01:15:55,222 --> 01:15:56,224
There's something wrong.

1294
01:15:56,390 --> 01:16:01,395
You know with Tilikum that
there's something wrong and that's--

1295
01:16:01,561 --> 01:16:04,731
when you have a relationship
with that animal and you--

1296
01:16:06,192 --> 01:16:10,570
you understand that he's killing
not to be a savage.

1297
01:16:10,738 --> 01:16:13,407
He's not killing because he's just crazy.

1298
01:16:13,573 --> 01:16:16,409
He's not killing because
he doesn't know what he's doing.

1299
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:18,246
He's killing because he's frustrated

1300
01:16:18,412 --> 01:16:24,001
and he's got aggravations
and he doesn't know how to--

1301
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:26,295
he has no outlet for it.

1302
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:30,091
Now Tilikum is spending
a great deal of time by himself

1303
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:34,095
and basically floating lifeless in a pool.

1304
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,056
Three hours now...

1305
01:16:38,224 --> 01:16:40,184
and he hasn't moved.

1306
01:16:41,394 --> 01:16:43,104
They try to sugarcoat it by saying,

1307
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,854
"He comes out in the front pool
every once in a while.

1308
01:16:45,021 --> 01:16:46,314
Now he's doing shows."

1309
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:47,483
Really? You know
what he does in a show?

1310
01:16:49,068 --> 01:16:50,778
He does a few bows

1311
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:54,489
and then he goes back in his little jail cell.

1312
01:16:54,657 --> 01:16:55,949
That's his life.

1313
01:16:58,034 --> 01:17:00,203
I feel sad for Tilikum.

1314
01:17:00,371 --> 01:17:03,416
A regal thing like him swimming around the tank

1315
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:05,376
with his fin flopped over like that

1316
01:17:05,542 --> 01:17:08,587
compared to a wild bull killer whale that size,

1317
01:17:08,753 --> 01:17:11,256
which is one of the most kinetic
and dynamic things

1318
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:12,966
you can imagine...

1319
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:17,762
I feel sad when I see him.

1320
01:17:24,311 --> 01:17:26,063
It's time to stop the shows.

1321
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:28,565
It's time to stop forcing animals to perform

1322
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:30,484
in basically a circus environment.

1323
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:32,569
And they should release the animals
that are young enough

1324
01:17:32,737 --> 01:17:35,655
and healthy enough to be released,
and the animals like Tilikum

1325
01:17:35,823 --> 01:17:38,617
who are old and sick and have put in
25 years in the industry

1326
01:17:38,783 --> 01:17:40,202
should be released to an open ocean pen

1327
01:17:40,368 --> 01:17:41,578
so they can live out their lives

1328
01:17:41,746 --> 01:17:43,747
and just experience
the natural rhythms of the ocean.

1329
01:17:43,913 --> 01:17:45,707
This is a multibillion-dollar
corporation

1330
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:49,712
that makes its money
through the exploitation of orcas.

1331
01:17:49,878 --> 01:17:52,213
They're not suitable to have in captivity.

1332
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:54,591
The whales are really bored.

1333
01:17:54,759 --> 01:17:59,012
You deprive them of all
this environmental stimulation.

1334
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,140
I think that in 50 years,

1335
01:18:01,306 --> 01:18:04,100
we'll look back and go,
"My God, what a barbaric time."

1336
01:18:44,891 --> 01:18:47,520
Dawn Brancheau--
DB, dream big.

1337
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:52,065
Dawn was the most loving,
giving person you ever met.

1338
01:18:52,233 --> 01:18:55,485
Her smile just radiated.

1339
01:19:04,203 --> 01:19:06,831
She's comp-- she fulfilled her life.

1340
01:19:55,253 --> 01:19:56,921
We saw whales

1341
01:19:57,088 --> 01:20:00,842
swimming in straight lines
with straight dorsal fins.

1342
01:20:02,219 --> 01:20:04,680
I was so honored to be there.

1343
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:12,563
And I was so thankful that I had sunglasses on

1344
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:15,983
because the tears were kind of coming out.

1345
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:18,819
And it was moving.

1346
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,140
