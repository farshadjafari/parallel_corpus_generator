1
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:37,281
- Quack, quack.
- Look out!

2
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,700
He singed my tail feathers.

3
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,994
Yee-ha!

4
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,251
All right, Buzz. That's enough of that.

5
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,258
What did I just say?

6
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,802
That is a good way to lose an eye, my friend.

7
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,638
Hold it. We've got company at two o'clock.

8
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,557
I got him, Mailman. Hang on.

9
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,935
Here we go.

10
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,357
- Buzz, what is goin' on up there?
- Just movin' a road hog.

11
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,906
- Knock it off! What kind of stunt was that?
- Just seein' what this baby can do.

12
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,245
This bag of bones isn't rated past Mach two.

13
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,375
- Mach one!
- The G-forces, Buzz! The G-forces!

14
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,627
Mach two! Gotta push the envelope.

15
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,214
Mach three!

16
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,967
Buzz! We're tearing apart!

17
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,557
I'm losin' control.
Eject, Mailman. Hit the silk!

18
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,811
- I can't get out!
- What are you doing?

19
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,564
Buzz! Get back here!

20
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,650
OK. I've been in tougher scrapes than this.

21
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:58,112
There's the ground. It looks hard. OK, trees.

22
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,406
No! Oh. Mahogany. Ow!

23
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,742
Squirrel's nest. Bird. Ow! Pine.

24
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,493
Ow! Oh, the ground.

25
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,204
Oh... Oh...

26
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,832
Oh, I made it.

27
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,002
I made it! There is a God.

28
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,671
Hallelujaaaaaa!

29
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:20,217
Ow! Oh! Ouch! Ow!

30
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,515
Oh, you're French, aren't you?

31
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,684
Ah... yeah, just like that.

32
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,039
- Hey, look! There's one!
- Uh-oh.

33
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,802
Topper Harley?

34
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,096
Once, perhaps.

35
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,098
Now I am called Tukachinchilla.

36
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,393
- What does it mean?
- Fluffy Bunny Feet.

37
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,356
It's very nice.

38
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,608
I'm Lieutenant Commander James Block.

39
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,943
I knew your father Buzz.

40
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:05,631
Until his incident, he was
the greatest pilot who ever lived.

41
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,036
We need to talk.

42
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,800
The Navy wants...

43
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,576
The Navy wants you back, Harley.

44
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,646
They threw me out. Why should I go back?

45
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,942
I came here to get away from the Navy.
Away from flying.

46
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,086
The Navy has
a top-secret mission: Sleepy Weasel.

47
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,255
I'm giving you a second chance,
which your father never had.

48
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,466
You're the best of the best, Topper.

49
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:13,015
Leave me to speak with the
one. He is wise in the ways of such things.

50
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,979
The Navy really needs you.

51
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,981
Great helium!

52
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,445
Owatonna.

53
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,490
Owatonna!

54
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,830
Every night I hope and pray

55
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:21,417
A dream lover will come my way

56
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,171
A girl to hold in my arms

57
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,798
And know the magic of her charms

58
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,092
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

59
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,886
- A girl
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

60
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,762
- To call
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

61
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,222
- My own
- Yeah-yeah

62
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,516
I want a dream lover

63
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:41,437
I don't have to dream alone

64
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,692
Dream lover, until then

65
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,196
I'll go to sleep, I'll dream again

66
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,991
That's the only thing to do

67
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,994
Till all my lover's dreams come true

68
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,288
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

69
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,873
- A girl
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

70
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,708
- To call
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

71
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,084
- My own
- Yeah-yeah

72
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,378
I want a dream lover

73
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:10,257
I don't have to dream alone

74
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,763
Dream lover, until then

75
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,308
I'll go to sleep, I'll dream again

76
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,062
That's the only thing to do

77
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,023
Till all my lover's dreams come true

78
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,067
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

79
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,777
- A girl
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

80
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,695
- To call
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

81
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,030
- My own
- Yeah-yeah

82
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,491
I want a dream lover

83
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,036
I don't have to dream alone

84
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,164
Wow!

85
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,105
Wha-hoo!

86
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,456
Ten... hut!

87
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,720
Admiral. Good to see you again, sir.

88
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,431
- It's been too long.
- And so it has. Yes, yes.

89
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,558
- How are ya, sir?
- Hawaii?

90
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,979
- Goddamn it, Bill, I should be in California.
- No, sir, this is California.

91
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:51,066
- Well, gotta run. Good luck.
- But, sir, this is your command.

92
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,904
Sleepy Weasel has been planned for
ten months. The president hand-picked you.

93
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,574
Damn right he did.
No stoppin' us now, huh, Ted?

94
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,308
I'll show you your
offices and brief you.

95
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:04,288
You're a fine soldier, Scott.
Lead the way.

96
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,457
Oh, good God. I gotta pee.

97
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,501
I had part of my bladder
blown off at Guadalcanal.

98
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,921
Watch your step.
There's a lot of obstructions here.

99
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,759
- I had a little dreidel!
- I made it out of clay!

100
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:20,471
- And when it's dry and ready...
- My dreidel I will play!

101
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,474
- Here's the story...
- Of a lovely lady!

102
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,852
- Who was bringing up...
- Three very lovely girls!

103
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,813
- All of them had hair of gold!
- Like their mother!

104
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,358
- The youngest one...
- In curls!

105
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,693
- Here's the story...
- Of a man named Brady!

106
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,580
Gentlemen, he's back.

107
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,584
How ya been?

108
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,338
- Yeah, it's the big guy.
- Good to see ya.

109
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,341
- Scooter! How you doin'?
- Topper. The main man.

110
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,428
- Rabbi! Mazel tov.
- You should live and be well!

111
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,323
Hey, buddy.

112
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,283
Are you OK?

113
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,744
You don't look so hot. You need some help?

114
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,871
I'm OK.

115
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,083
You're Topper Harley, aren't you?

116
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:35,421
I hear you've got chops we only dream of.
Throwin' you out was a bum rap.

117
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,757
I'm Jim Pfaffenbach.
Everybody calls me Wash Out.

118
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,929
- You're a pilot?
- Oh, yeah. I'm gonna be flyin' with ya.

119
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,099
Good.

120
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,143
Phew.

121
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,691
Cute.

122
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,361
I like to stay in shape. Thanks.

123
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,780
- Are these all at home?
- Yeah.

124
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,700
The dogs, wife and kids.

125
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,203
You got pictures of your family,
I'd love to see 'em.

126
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:13,375
- I am my family photo.
- But everybody needs a family to love.

127
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,997
I could never find time for love.
It's too heavy.

128
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:19,006
It's an anchor
that drowns a man.

129
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,926
Besides, I got the sky,
the smell of jet exhaust, my bike.

130
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,887
- A loner?
- No. I own it.

131
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,391
I can see I'm gonna have to work on you.

132
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,602
Name's Pete Thompson. But...

133
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,522
...everybody calls me Dead Meat.

134
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,192
- Topper Harley.
- Just a pleasure.

135
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,865
Attention on deck!

136
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,285
Good morning, sir!

137
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,247
I don't care
how many missions you've flown!

138
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:56,543
I don't care how good you think you are!
You're nobody!

139
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,839
And for the next ten days,
nobody takes a crap unless I say so!

140
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,425
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

141
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,136
I said "Attention".

142
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,265
Now, didn't I make myself clear?
Or don't you take orders?

143
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,685
- When I say "Attention", I mean "Attention".
- Yes, sir!

144
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,270
Now!

145
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,197
- You eyeballin' me, mister?
- No, sir!

146
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,727
The next time I see that
ugly face of yours,

147
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:30,118
I want it clean-shaven!
Suck in that chest!

148
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,999
Pfaffenbach!

149
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,880
- What you lookin' at, boy?
- Nothin', sir!

150
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,300
Oh, I'm some lowlife that's
not good enough for you to talk to?

151
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:50,013
Well, that attitude is short on collateral!
I'm God as far as you're concerned!

152
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,640
Hey, hey. Lighten up.

153
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,726
Cut the kid some slack.

154
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,313
Who the hell are you talkin' to, son?

155
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,317
Your ego's writin' cheques
your body can't cash.

156
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,945
Now you got five minutes
to stow your gear.

157
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,405
Get movin'!

158
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,202
Yeah, I'm sure deep down he means well.

159
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,790
I hope you were paying attention.

160
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,502
- I don't think we've met.
- Kent Gregory.

161
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,588
Excuse me if I don't shake your hand.

162
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:28,218
Your father killed someone very special
to me: Dominic "Mailman" Farnham.

163
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,970
- You mean...
- Yes.

164
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,806
Dominic Farnham was my father.
I was his love child.

165
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:36,643
- It was a hunting accident.
- Accident, my deep-blue eyes.

166
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,147
It was reckless, irresponsible flying,
and you know it.

167
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,607
Are you OK?

168
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,943
This is an incredible coincidence,

169
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,945
but the hunter who mistakenly
killed your father

170
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,120
was Henry Pfaffenbach, my father.

171
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,874
I feel terrible.

172
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,877
Isn't this Henry Alva Pfaffenbach?

173
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,755
My mother was a Pfaffenbach.

174
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,758
Not... Doreen Pfaffenbach?

175
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,968
- From Minnesota?
- Yeah.

176
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:14,056
Then we're cousins! We used to
spend our summers in Eagle River.

177
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,099
Eagle River?

178
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,935
I hope you can forgive me for this.

179
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,065
If it helps, I didn't have seconds.

180
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:28,654
That's all right. It's not your fault.
Anyone could have made that mistake.

181
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,659
But him... he's the type that could
end up killing every man in this outfit.

182
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,746
Wait a minute. Why are you mad at me?
He's the one who ate your father.

183
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,751
Like father, like son.
You've already been tossed out once.

184
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,045
Hold it, hold it.

185
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:49,424
We can't fight among ourselves.
We're all on the same team here.

186
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,386
I want the two of you to shake hands.

187
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,434
There, now. Isn't that better?

188
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,645
- Yeah.
- Sure.

189
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,982
There. We're friends again.

190
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,820
Here. Have some of my lucky gum.

191
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:15,534
Look, Dead Meat. We fly together,
we sleep next to each other, but that's all.

192
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:19,121
Don't get too close.
Let me handle my own affairs.

193
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,543
He's so complex.

194
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,173
Aerial photos and recon reports
indicate a defensive arsenal

195
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,467
in the D, and perhaps -C, categories.

196
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,970
There's also some anti-aircraft squadrons.

197
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,391
They can send up an ack-ack umbrella
high enough to make any attack ineffective.

198
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,728
I don't have a clue
what you're talkin' about, Phil.

199
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,732
I have a shell the size of a fist in my head
Pork Chop Hill.

200
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,775
The only way I can make this toup stay on

201
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,446
is by magnetising the upper left
quadrant of my skull.

202
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,741
You just go ahead and do what you do.
Do you have any soup?

203
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,327
Of course, sir. I'll have the mess
bring something right up.

204
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,164
I love soup. I mean, I think I love soup.

205
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,792
Son-of-a-bitchin' shell. It's either
soup or duck. Which one do you shoot?

206
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,043
Duck, sir.

207
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,048
- Are you all right, sir?
- Of course I'm all right.

208
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,675
Why? What have you heard?

209
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,511
Nothing, sir.

210
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,972
Send some soup up for the admiral,
on the double.

211
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,684
Let's go over this Slippery Weevil
one more time.

212
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,458
I wanna familiarise
myself with it as much

213
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:28,273
as I possibly can. So...
give it to me, Ben.

214
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,442
Every word. Every detail.

215
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,110
Dot every comma.

216
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,779
Those are some long legs.

217
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:20,075
I just had them lengthened.
Now they go all the way up.

218
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,576
Wow.

219
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,078
It's nice to see you again.

220
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,498
I was really impressed,
the way you handled that stallion.

221
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,187
When I saw you dig your
heels into his sides

222
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:31,503
tighten the reins and
break his spirit,

223
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,547
I never wanted to be a horse
so much in my life.

224
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:38,218
After I finish off this shrink,
we can take a quick canter in the meadow.

225
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:40,428
Lieutenant, I am the shrink.

226
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:45,183
- You're the psychiatrist?
- That's what the diploma says.

227
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,645
I've never been to a psychiatrist before.
You will be gentle?

228
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,526
I've been ordered to review your records.

229
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,322
You were discharged from the service
18 months ago for wilful insubordination.

230
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:05,370
You disobeyed a direct order
and lost a $13m fighter in the process.

231
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,249
Yes, I did. But I'm payin' it off
at ten bucks a week.

232
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,627
I should have gotten
that extra collision coverage.

233
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,881
Wasn't your father involved
in a similar incident?

234
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:19,050
- What do you mean?
- Leland "Buzz" Harley.

235
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,053
Three Purple Hearts,
presidential commendation.

236
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,598
Then this incident,
the Dominic Farnham death.

237
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,976
1971, his Visa card was cancelled.

238
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,353
1975, a broken man,

239
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,648
suffocated while working
the night shift in a Fotomat booth.

240
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,903
Tell me how these events affected you.

241
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,365
Well, I... I don't think about it much.

242
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,452
That was a long time ago.

243
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,163
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some guns to grease.

244
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,457
Lieutenant...

245
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,668
Have you thought about
seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis?

246
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,171
I thought you'd never ask.

247
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,923
I mean professionally.

248
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,718
Thanks, Doctor.

249
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,346
Thanks for the advice.

250
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,974
- Be careful out there.
- I can take care of myself.

251
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:12,020
- No. You're going to get hurt.
- I don't need your help, or anybody's.

252
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,438
I'll be just fine.

253
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,861
Are you OK?

254
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,161
Yeah. I'm fine.

255
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,832
Oh...

256
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,170
Attention on deck.

257
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,922
At ease, men.

258
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,302
Be seated.

259
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,305
Many of you are wondering
about my pants.

260
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:51,768
Well, they ran short of
material at the knee.

261
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,895
So don't give me any shit.

262
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,233
Now, I look out there
at all of you guys and I say to myself:

263
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,653
What I wouldn't give
to be 20 years younger,

264
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,862
and a woman.

265
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:09,327
You know, I've flown over 194 missions,
and I was shot down on every one.

266
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:13,748
Come to think of it, I've never
landed a plane in my life. Now,

267
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:18,044
you men'll be piloting the backbone
of our proud American arsenal:

268
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:22,298
The Oscar EW 5894 Phallus
tactical fighter bomber.

269
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:26,636
Its lightweight sweptwing design
makes it extremely manoeuvrable and agile.

270
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:32,684
Beneath its 21st-century skin is a highly
advanced avionics and weapons package.

271
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,395
Designed for speed and combat acrobatics,

272
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:40,442
it features the latest Mrs Halver
series 3800 radar-jamming Framus.

273
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,696
- Admiral.
- Nurse.

274
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,200
Sleepy Weasel's success depends
on our manoeuvring below enemy radar.

275
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:53,538
I wanna see a major display of low-level
flying. Topper, Kent, you're up first.

276
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,042
- Show me what you can do.
- Copy that, Purple Fluffer Nutter.

277
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,127
Roger that, Milli Vanilli Chilly Willy.

278
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,058
Bring 'em down, boys. I
want your bellies to

279
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:07,635
scrape the sagebrush.
Let's see who's best.

280
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,013
I'm heading for the canyon floor.

281
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,563
- For your information, I'm at 150 feet.
- I'm at 3rd and Main.

282
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,617
Very pretty,
but enough hot-dogging, Harley.

283
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,786
Just checkin' the traffic.

284
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,336
- How'd I do, big fella?
- Don't get me started, Harley.

285
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:44,756
Cut the chatter. Topper,
that was vintage Buzz Harley.

286
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,342
You and your dad are two of a kind.

287
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:50,011
Your ego's writin' cheques
your body can't cash.

288
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,850
Topper! Get back in formation!

289
00:24:01,324 --> 00:24:03,099
Topper, you weren't clear to detach.

290
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,281
- What was that all about?
- I, uh... thought I saw Elvis.

291
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,201
Let it go, Topper.
The King is gone. Let's head for home.

292
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,381
Not again!

293
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:31,636
I need a landing clearance
for runway 30... 30 something.

294
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,223
30-thirty-something's been cancelled.
Go to runway 2-niner.

295
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:40,887
Wash Out, what the hell
are you doin'? Pull it up.

296
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:48,987
Wash Out, where the hell are you?
What is your location? You're off of radar.

297
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,572
Repeat: What is your location?

298
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,700
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone

299
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,582
- Goin' up?
- Yes.

300
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,594
Can I press your button?

301
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:17,098
No, you've been slavin' over hot psychotics
all day. Let me get that.

302
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,691
- Interesting perfume.
- It's Vicks. I have a cold.

303
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:27,817
Ah.

304
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:32,071
Lieutenant, you're staring.

305
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,033
No, not really. I'm lost in your eyes.

306
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:40,955
That is the whitest white part of the eye
I've ever seen. Do you floss?

307
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,291
You're very confident, aren't you?

308
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,545
When you have 10,000 pounds of thrust
at your command, you have to be.

309
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:51,633
Lieutenant, please.
I'm talking to you as a psychiatrist.

310
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,054
I'm recommending that you be grounded.

311
00:25:56,931 --> 00:26:00,350
- You've got to be joking.
- If I were joking, I'd have said...

312
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,493
"What do you do
with an elephant with three balls?"

313
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,271
"You walk him and pitch to the rhino."

314
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:10,485
- You are serious.
- It's the best thing for you, and the mission.

315
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,030
The best would be
if you'd stop tryin' to run my life.

316
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,908
I'm a pilot, and nobody's gonna
keep me out of the sky.

317
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:23,456
Ladies and gentlemen!
Twelve rounds of boxing

318
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,919
for the WBA WBC WPA RSVP

319
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,005
Heavyweight Championship of the World!

320
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,342
Introducing celebrities at ringside,

321
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,346
please welcome His Holiness,
the very popular pontiff,

322
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,350
Pope John Paul II!

323
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,685
Second!

324
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:50,441
Lieutenant Commander Block.
We meet at last.

325
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:55,154
- Isn't this place a little public?
- No, a crowd offers remarkable anonymity.

326
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,241
How are we doing at Dudley?

327
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,451
Oh, we're right on schedule.

328
00:27:00,503 --> 00:27:02,303
Can't quite get a reading
on Admiral Benson,

329
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:05,523
but Topper Harley's playing into our hands.

330
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:10,211
Here's his evaluation. A clear-cut case
of Paternal Conflict Syndrome.

331
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,463
Ah, yes. PCS.

332
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:17,051
I saw an Afterschool Special on that.
They're years away from a vaccine.

333
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,805
Every time I mention Buzz's name,
Topper goes off.

334
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,683
There's no way the unit will function,
and I'll abort the mission.

335
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,948
The Navy's planes will
seem inferior and the

336
00:27:27,949 --> 00:27:30,440
president will beg
for my superfighter.

337
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,693
And, best of all, nobody gets hurt.

338
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,112
Well done, Lieutenant Commander.

339
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:40,575
America can't afford to fall behind,
Mr Wilson. We need your plane.

340
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,078
This should be a good match.
Both men work for Don King.

341
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,086
Well, fans, that's it.

342
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,797
Good night. I'm outta here!

343
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:59,802
The Strafing Run
proudly presents Lawrence Lipps!

344
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:02,013
And now...

345
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,639
What the world needs

346
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:04,932
Thank you!

347
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,017
Is love

348
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,268
Thank you so much!

349
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:11,856
That's the only thing
that there's just too darn little of

350
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,117
Ramada?

351
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,953
- Kent!
- Ramada!

352
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,791
Qu'est-ce que je suis contente de te revoir.

353
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,002
Argh! My eyes!

354
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,963
Darling, I thought you were still in Brussel.

355
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,633
Oh, Kent. We were only hurting each other.

356
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:40,259
I thought that's the way you wanted it.

357
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:47,517
Something's changed. It's not another
woman, is it? I couldn't compete with that.

358
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,811
No, of course you couldn't.

359
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:54,982
Well, what matters is that you're here.
We've a lot of catching up to do.

360
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,277
Wonderful. Just let me
take care of something.

361
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:01,155
- Don't be long, mon amour.
- Absolument.

362
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,297
Some day he'll come along

363
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,342
The man I love

364
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,262
And he'll be big and strong

365
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,973
The man I love

366
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,601
And when he comes my way

367
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,062
I'll do my best

368
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:37,608
To make... him... stay

369
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,197
He'll look at me and smile

370
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,534
I'll understand

371
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,495
And in a little while

372
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,081
He'll take my hand

373
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,002
And though it seems absurd

374
00:29:56,336 --> 00:30:02,717
I know we both... won't say... a... word

375
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,428
Wow!

376
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,347
Anybody here from out of town?

377
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,393
Welcome. Nice to see you.

378
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:19,400
Maybe I shall meet him someday

379
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,487
Maybe Monday

380
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,364
Maybe not

381
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,412
Still I'm sure to meet him one day

382
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,624
Maybe Tuesday

383
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,212
Will be my good-news day

384
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,228
We'll build a little home

385
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,897
Just meant for two

386
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,025
From which I'll never roam

387
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,945
Who would? Would you?

388
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,114
And so all else above

389
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,659
I'm dreaming of

390
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:14,872
The man... I... love

391
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:18,042
One day he'll come along

392
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,003
He'll be big and strong

393
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,257
And when he comes my way

394
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:27,385
I'll do my best to make him stay

395
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,472
And so all else above

396
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,599
I'm dreamin' of

397
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:40,648
The man I love

398
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,327
- Ramada...
- Oh, no.

399
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,998
Well, if it isn't God's gift to the cockpit.

400
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:02,503
- Kent, your nostrils are flaring.
- That flying stunt today was pure madness.

401
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:06,090
If a lady wasn't present,
I'd tear you apart like a Christmas goose.

402
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,677
Yeah? Keep it up, you'll be carrying
your face home in a doggy bag.

403
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,304
What is this macho thing?

404
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,848
- He started it.
- Did not.

405
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,558
- Did too.
- Did not.

406
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,352
- You're behaving like children.
- He's a jerk.

407
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,021
- Am not.
- Are too.

408
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,981
- Am not.
- Are too too too...

409
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,691
- Not not not...
...too too too...

410
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,484
Are too times ten.

411
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,029
- That's it.
- Stop it.

412
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,697
- Rumble!
- Don't push me.

413
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:42,418
Stop it! Can't you act
like civilised human beings?

414
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:45,171
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- I love you, pal.

415
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:52,219
Listen. Kent and I have to talk, so please...

416
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,722
Be my guest.

417
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,317
Let's celebrate, honey.

418
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,653
Hey, everybody. Drinks are on me.

419
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,488
- Free beer!
- I want a gin sling!

420
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,960
You haven't forgotten my offer, have you?

421
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:29,173
Little house in the country,
white picket fence, StairMaster.

422
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,218
Kent, you're everything
a woman could possibly want.

423
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,263
But I'm just not ready for marriage. Not yet.

424
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,352
Well, I have to get back to the base.
Tomorrow's an important flight.

425
00:33:41,503 --> 00:33:44,138
You know how puffy my eyes get
when I don't get enough rest.

426
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,859
Good night.

427
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:54,990
May I?

428
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,870
- Shouldn't you be getting back to the base?
- I suppose,

429
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,248
if I played life by the rules,
but you know I don't.

430
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,335
All right. You can walk me to my apartment.

431
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,007
I shouldn't have gotten mad
in the elevator today.

432
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:14,760
But when I want something that bad,
I get all fired up.

433
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,973
Maybe that's why I worry so.
Maybe more than I should.

434
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,268
Something terrible could happen.
You must...

435
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,688
- But I...
- Don't worry.

436
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,733
Everything will be fine. I promise.

437
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,943
Boy, I hope so.

438
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,077
Well, this is it.

439
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,915
- It's a nice place.
- It's OK.

440
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,877
The only problem is I have a nosy landlady.

441
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,673
Well, I guess this is good night.

442
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,342
I don't wanna go back.

443
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,512
You don't have to.

444
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,848
I don't want to be alone.

445
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,727
And, by the way,
I can go all night like a lumberjack.

446
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,982
What about your landlady?

447
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,233
You can do her, too.

448
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:30,169
So, I take it you've been with a man before.

449
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,005
I'm a virgin.

450
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,800
I'm just not very good at it.

451
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,452
Ooh!

452
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,216
Ah!

453
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,312
Yes. Oh, yes...

454
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,580
Ah! Topper...

455
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:43,427
Oh...

456
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,493
Wash Out!

457
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,289
Get into your flight suit.
We're ready to go up.

458
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,210
I got kicked out.
My flight status has been withdrawn.

459
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,378
I'm through, Dead Meat.

460
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,465
- What happened?
- It's my eyes. I've got walleye vision.

461
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:29,306
- Can't something be done?
- A delicate corneal inversion procedure.

462
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:30,975
A multioptipupiloptomy.

463
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,851
But, to keep from
damaging the eye sockets,

464
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,695
they've gotta go in through the rectum.

465
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,898
Ain't no man gonna take that route with me.

466
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,835
Is Topper around? I'd like to say goodbye.

467
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,352
He didn't come back last night.
He's AWOL.

468
00:38:45,353 --> 00:38:47,866
As soon as Block finds
out, he's history.

469
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,661
But flying's his life.
He's the best pilot in the world.

470
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,830
We need him as much as he needs us.

471
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:56,125
I can't find my lucky gum. Do you have...

472
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,876
Wash Out?

473
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,018
Oh, my God. I missed my flight.

474
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,603
You're amazing.

475
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,191
Dead Meat!

476
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:26,447
Mary!

477
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,368
- Come to watch me fly?
- No. There was a meltdown at the plant.

478
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,454
- They gave me afternoon off.
- Terrific!

479
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:39,877
Oh! Good news. We just closed escrow
on our little dream house.

480
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,212
- Wonderful! When do we move in?
- Tuesday.

481
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,049
The kids are stripping
the asbestos off the pipes now.

482
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,385
That's great!
Things couldn't be better for us.

483
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,970
I'm so blessed.

484
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:53,807
Oh! Your life insurance forms
came for you to sign.

485
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,603
Oh, my mirror!

486
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,483
Huh!

487
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:07,571
- I'll get another pen.
- No need. I'll sign it when I get back.

488
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,281
Well, you know best.

489
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:13,660
Honey, you know that global-warming
problem? I know how we can reverse it.

490
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,497
- Tell me.
- No, not now, lovey-bumpers.

491
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,749
There'll be plenty of time for that later.

492
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,710
And my investigation
into JFK's assassination?

493
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,962
You found the evidence you wanted?

494
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:28,175
Yes. It's right here in my pocket.
It's big, honey.

495
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,843
It goes all the way to the White House.

496
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:34,348
- Do you want me to hold it for you?
- Nah. It'll be safe right here.

497
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,600
I'm in a jet. What could go wrong?

498
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:41,188
Oh, Dead Meat. We just couldn't be
any more perfectly happy.

499
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:50,823
Where the hell is Topper?

500
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,951
Thanks for joinin' the party!

501
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:58,330
Hey, Topper!
You seen any of my lucky gum?

502
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,456
No.

503
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,710
Freedom Squadron, start your engines.

504
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:09,967
God, that's loud. My ear canals
are very sensitive. Stainless steel.

505
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:13,887
Took a bullet in Corregidor.
Passed straight through. Look at this.

506
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,311
Huh?

507
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,524
We have these to hold down the sound, sir.

508
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:27,901
Oh, good. Thanks.

509
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,075
Let's hope they do the trick.
Give me the mike, boy.

510
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,078
For the love of God, man, be careful!

511
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:40,873
Ever since Normandy, this is CorningWare.

512
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:45,627
Those of you who excel
during these aerial combat exercises

513
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:50,174
will go on to make up
the greatest fighting unit ever assembled.

514
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:56,180
- Topper, keep that nose up!
- He's never done that before.

515
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,600
Red team leader, break off.
Prepare to engage.

516
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,268
Roger that.

517
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,524
- Blue leader, prepare for action.
- Roger that.

518
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,784
I'm minus six. Movin' in.

519
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:22,456
I've got tone! Got him!

520
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:24,708
Dead Meat, confirm kill.

521
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,426
- Mrs Thompson?
- Yes.

522
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,888
- I'm Topper Harley.
- Oh! Dead Meat's talked about you!

523
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,474
Oh, he thinks the world of you!

524
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,976
But... shouldn't you be
up there flying with the squad?

525
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,816
I've got a lock. I'm closing in.

526
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,570
- Uh-oh!
- He's spotted me! He's a slippery devil.

527
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,116
Topper! Watch your right side! Damn!

528
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,993
I'm bailin' out!

529
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:07,084
Wash Out? What are you doin' here?

530
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,877
There's no time to go into it.

531
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,337
Uh-oh!

532
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,839
Do me a favour, don't land.

533
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:18,011
- Get outta here! We're gonna crash!
- I can't! I'm stuck!

534
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,889
Then I must help you, my friend!
Think well of me!

535
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:27,020
Thank youuuuu...

536
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,190
- Don't. Don't look.
- Oh, no!

537
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,031
Whoa!

538
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,548
Oh, man!

539
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,300
Wendy, I can fly!

540
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,684
- Hey, Topper.
- Easy, buddy.

541
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,064
- The darnedest thing just happened.
- Hang on, buddy.

542
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:12,899
Topper?

543
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,194
Swing him around this way.

544
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,782
Let's go. One, two...

545
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,703
Let's move it. Come on!

546
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,413
- Come on!
- Enough!

547
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,835
Hello!

548
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,902
We'll have you in the hospital in no time.

549
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:04,451
Good morning! Excuse me!

550
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,371
Wait, guys! Wait!

551
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,499
Let's go, let's go.

552
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,626
Easy. Easy, easy, easy.

553
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,879
- Let's move.
- What a ride!

554
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,883
- Wash Out. You made it.
- Why, thank you, André.

555
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,094
I'll have the veal piccata.

556
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,099
- Oh. Get the cardio read-out.
- Where is it?

557
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,894
- Um... It's, uh...
- Hey, fellas...

558
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,397
- Inside there on the left.
- I can't find it!

559
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:37,859
- Doctor!
- What happened?

560
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,319
Plane crash.

561
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,866
- We gotta work fast. I got a lunch.
- You're missing the big picture, Doc.

562
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:46,993
Nurse, check his penis
isn't longer than mine.

563
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,830
- No, Doctor.
- Good. Now this is gonna hurt.

564
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:50,956
Ow!

565
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,750
Nurse, give me 15cc of morphine, quickly!

566
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,920
- Can you save him?
- Can't be sure. I'm not a good doctor.

567
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,880
Thank you, Nurse. Wait here.

568
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,259
- You gonna be all right, buddy?
- I'm in a hospital! What could go wrong?

569
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:18,024
Mrs Thompson, I know you must hate me
but... there's something I want you to have.

570
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:20,318
I've been puttin' a little away
for the past ten years.

571
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:24,156
It's not much. 2500. I wish I could do more.

572
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,450
Why, Topper.

573
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,202
That's so sweet.

574
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,000
Why, with the three million
I won on this lucky Lotto ticket,

575
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:39,754
I can take this 2500
and just blow it all on hats.

576
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,428
Right, and halt!

577
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,942
Pete "Dead Meat" Thompson... is dead.

578
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,195
So is Mo Green,

579
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:06,531
Tataglia, Barzini,

580
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:09,117
the heads of all the five families.

581
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:14,289
It is at moments like these, my dear friends
that we must ask ourselves,

582
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,375
"How can this not be part
of some larger plan?"

583
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,963
Do good men like Dead Meat Thompson
just blink out one day like a bad bulb?

584
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:25,675
One minute you're in bed
with a knockout gal, or guy,

585
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,636
and the next, you're a compost heap.

586
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,390
Doesn't that bother you?
Because it scares the living piss outta me!

587
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,895
I never thought this could happen.

588
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,231
Don't we have what we need now,
Mr Wilson?

589
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,858
This should be enough to prove
that our planes need replacing.

590
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,248
No. They have to fail
in combat for the world

591
00:47:45,249 --> 00:47:47,656
to take notice. This
is a minor incident.

592
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:51,201
Minor? I just lost one of my best men!

593
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,205
Are you backing out on us, Block?

594
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,332
I'm doing this for my country,

595
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,917
not for you.

596
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,132
We'll need the backup plan.

597
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,218
Ready... Fire!

598
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,637
Jumpin' Jesus, they're back!

599
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:14,266
Take cover! Hit the deck!

600
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,562
Cover me!

601
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,690
Battle stations! Battle stations!

602
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,486
Have they no respect for the dead?

603
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,663
God, I love a good funeral.

604
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,809
Topper, where are you going?

605
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,146
I'm handin' in my resignation.

606
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,481
You were right.
You said I was dangerous, and I am.

607
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,941
Topper, wait.

608
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:08,695
Please, let's talk. Huh?

609
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,451
They're right. I'm no better than my father.

610
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:18,913
It seems, no matter what I do,
I end up hurting someone.

611
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,374
Ow!

612
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,338
You've got to stop comparing yourself
with your father.

613
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,381
You're two different people.

614
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:31,468
- We both killed a man.
- That's just a coincidence.

615
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,637
He loved jets. So do I.

616
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,889
He was a loner, just like me.

617
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,558
For God's sakes,
I've even got my father's eyes.

618
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:43,063
- Topper, please!
- Ah, they're just for luck.

619
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,607
You've got to make your own luck.

620
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,443
Get back in the sky and prove yourself.

621
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:50,779
Besides, there's something else.

622
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:57,202
After our first meeting in my office,
I sent my evaluation to Commander Block.

623
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:01,206
I recommended you be grounded.
I was afraid someone might get hurt.

624
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:02,916
What are you saying?

625
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,253
I think someone wants Sleepy Weasel
to fail.

626
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,257
- That's heavy.
- Totally.

627
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,843
That's the other reason why you need to fly.

628
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:17,514
This could be your only opportunity
to save the mission

629
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:21,434
and solve your personal problems,
all in one fell swoop.

630
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:35,573
Now read it back to me, Francine.

631
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:40,203
"And if you ever put your goddamn hands
on my wife again..."

632
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:46,042
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Oh, Blank. Come in.

633
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:47,794
I've been expecting someone.

634
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,422
- That'll be all, Francine.
- Yes, sir.

635
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,011
- Pudding?
- No, thank you, sir.

636
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:01,558
I'll put this to you straight.
Thompson's death shocked us all.

637
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,560
And that hot shot Harley is responsible.

638
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:06,354
I want that smirking little wise-ass
outta here.

639
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:12,986
Morale on this base is shot to hell.
Just look out there.

640
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,323
Quiet. Now, hardly a man moving.

641
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,201
Roy? Roy!

642
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:25,331
Huh? I even went to school with that man.
It's just not the same.

643
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:29,544
Been ignoring me all day.
Remind me to send him a note.

644
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,045
Sir, may I say something?

645
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,300
I know Harley acted irresponsibly.

646
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:39,012
But his kind lives on the edge.
Always willing to take a chance.

647
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,182
Now, we need Topper for this mission
for just that reason.

648
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,396
I like your thinking, Colonel.

649
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:51,024
Besides, Thompson wasn't that good a pilot.

650
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,618
He only had a small family.
The kids are a

651
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:56,070
pain in the ass. The
wife's on the sauce.

652
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,448
Poor bastard's better off dead.

653
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,408
What size shoes do you wear?

654
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,828
- A nine, sir.
- Good.

655
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,414
It's settled. We'll send Harley to the front.

656
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:10,460
By the way. Thank you for having us
over to dinner the other night.

657
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,004
Cheryl and I loved the stroganoff.

658
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:16,508
- Sir, we didn't have dinner the other night.
- Really?

659
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,512
Well, where the hell was I?
And who's this Cheryl?

660
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,680
Ah, doesn't matter.

661
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,390
Run along, Sid.

662
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,394
Cheryl?

663
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,776
Kent?

664
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,891
I came to get my chafing dish.
Our orders just came.

665
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,618
We're shipping out in one hour.

666
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,912
Are you comin' along this time?

667
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,997
- The chafing dish is not yours.
- It is.

668
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,208
- It isn't.
- OK, I don't want it.

669
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,009
- I'll take it.
- You stay out of it.

670
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,462
This is not the time or place.

671
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:57,799
I've got a big score
to settle with you, my friend.

672
00:52:58,551 --> 00:52:59,634
Excuse me.

673
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:06,266
I've hurt him.

674
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,351
Topper...

675
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,729
Topper, you better go. I have to think.

676
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,982
Well, I don't.

677
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,361
- I've fallen for you like a blind roofer.
- I'm sorry?

678
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:23,283
My heart is fallin' down around my ankles
like a wet pair of pants.

679
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,912
My whole life, all I've wanted to do is fly.

680
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:30,123
Bomb stuff. Shoot people down.

681
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:35,044
But we've been through so much together.
Ramada, I need you.

682
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,129
I want you.

683
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:42,093
Only you

684
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:47,807
Can make this world seem bright

685
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:52,604
Only you

686
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:56,983
Can make the darkness bright

687
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,318
Wow!

688
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:03,990
Only you, and you alone

689
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:09,913
Can thrill me like you do

690
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:16,920
And fill my heart with love for only you

691
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,422
Wah, wah, wah, wah

692
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,924
Ramada!

693
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:22,550
Topper!

694
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,929
Ramada!

695
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,058
I love you!

696
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,185
I love you.

697
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,941
You are my destiny

698
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,151
It's not that easy, Ramada.

699
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,198
This is one night you're not turning me out.

700
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:50,954
The magic that you do

701
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:54,374
You're my dream come true

702
00:54:54,458 --> 00:55:00,463
My one and only you

703
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:05,802
Oh-oh, only you

704
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:10,974
Can make this change in me

705
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:15,228
For it's true

706
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:19,816
You are my destiny

707
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,654
When you hold my hand

708
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,198
I understand

709
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:31,035
The magic that you do

710
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,580
You're my dream come true

711
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,165
My one

712
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:42,255
And only

713
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:46,134
You

714
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,263
Topper, I'm so confused. I need time alone.

715
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,625
Admiral Benson!

716
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:22,628
Really? That's my name, too.

717
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:28,005
Yankee Doodle Floppy Disk, this
is Foxtrot Zulu Milkshake.

718
00:56:28,006 --> 00:56:29,844
Request permission to land.

719
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:34,182
Roger that. You are cleared to land.
Welcome to the Mediterranean.

720
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,767
Wash Out, is that you?

721
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,772
You bet! They put me in charge of radar.
I'm your eyes on the ground.

722
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:47,111
All crews report to the flight deck.
All crews report to the flight deck.

723
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,611
Have you no decency?

724
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:41,707
Ah! The open sea.

725
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:46,796
Oh, God. I wish I could smell.
I had my nostrils fried in Panmunjom.

726
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,881
Admiral Benson!

727
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:53,636
Meet Mr Wilson and Mr Rosener
of Rockman Aviation.

728
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,429
They'll be observing the operation.

729
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:56,597
Yes, of course.

730
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,226
It's OK. I'm all right. No problem.

731
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,856
I slipped on the crab.
Who put that crab there?

732
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:09,026
- Crab? I didn't see any crab.
- There were two crabs. They work in pairs.

733
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:11,362
I went to Annapolis, for Christ's sake.

734
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,886
From the Pentagon, sir.
We just decoded it.

735
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,325
Help me with this.
My eyes are ceramic.

736
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:21,080
A bazooka round at Little Bighorn. Or was it
Okinawa? The one without the Indians.

737
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:24,000
It's final orders.
We strike tomorrow at 0600.

738
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:27,086
Excellent. Wake me up at, oh... 5.30.

739
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:04,832
- Get outta your flight suit. You're not going.
- What do you mean?

740
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:08,669
This mission is too important
to let you screw it up. You're not flying.

741
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,504
- Am too.
- Are not.

742
00:59:10,631 --> 00:59:14,592
- Am too.
- Oooh!

743
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,886
- All right, mister. Let's go at it.
- Let's do it.

744
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:19,305
Come on, come on.

745
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,195
Whoa!

746
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,989
- My face!
- My hand!

747
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,867
Attention on deck!

748
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,870
Be seated.

749
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,585
Gentlemen, we've waited
a long time to hear this.

750
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:53,798
In exactly five hours and 17 minutes,
we hit the enemy toast.

751
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:58,177
- I think that's the enemy coast, sir.
- Huh? Coast?

752
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,889
That'll take a little more planning.

753
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:05,685
We have to knock out the nuclear-weapons
plant at Falafel Heights.

754
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,479
The plant goes on line in 12 hours
and is heavily defended.

755
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,569
If you have trouble
hitting your objective,

756
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,278
your secondary targets
are here and here:

757
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,030
An accordion factory and a mime school.

758
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:21,701
Good luck, gentlemen. Blink, take over.

759
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,788
Oh, one more thing.

760
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:28,374
I'll get that. It's probably for me.

761
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,798
Our sortie will proceed as planned.

762
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,884
And I want Topper Harley
leading our squadron into battle.

763
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,764
Lieutenant Commander, sir.

764
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:47,977
It's nothing personal.
I know I speak for every man here.

765
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,146
We've lost all respect for Harley.

766
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,398
He's poison for the morale of the unit,

767
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,775
and a disaster
to the success of this mission.

768
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,529
You're outta line, Gregory.
You'll obey orders and like it.

769
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:01,741
Now get to your planes.

770
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:16,088
- Sir?
- What is it, Mr Harley?

771
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:20,009
- I hope I'm wrong about this.
- What would that be?

772
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:23,304
Nobody likes playing
for a coach who throws the big game.

773
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:25,765
What's that supposed to mean?

774
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:30,311
My uncle told me that not playin' to win
is like sleepin' with your sister.

775
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:34,815
Sure, she's a great piece of tail
with a blouseful of goodies, but it's illegal.

776
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:39,320
- Jesus, Topper. Come on.
- Then you get into that whole inbred thing.

777
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,489
Kids with no teeth who play the banjo,

778
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:44,116
eat apple sauce through a straw,
pork farm animals.

779
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,951
Topper, that's enough.

780
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:49,663
I think you get my point, sir.

781
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,940
I just hope you're playin' straight with us.

782
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:31,497
Alpha Velveeta Knuckle Underwear,
you are cleared for takeoff.

783
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:36,043
When you hit that nuclear-weapons plant,
drop a bomb for me.

784
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:38,963
Sphincter Mucous Niner Ringworm, roger.

785
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:06,907
Olé!

786
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,468
Yieeee!

787
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:40,941
Holy cow! My cap blew off!
Swing her round. We'll pick it up.

788
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:43,319
But, sir, we're on the mission.

789
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:47,573
Good thinking.
We'll pick it up on the way back.

790
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,410
We gotta mark the spot, though.
Put Rabinowitz in a life raft.

791
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:55,164
- Have him row in circles until we return.
- It could be days.

792
01:03:55,916 --> 01:04:00,503
Then put some food in the life raft, man.
Do I have to think of everything?

793
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:02,963
We'll tape his favourite shows.

794
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,133
- Sir, there's no time.
- OK, OK!

795
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:08,344
How can I be an admiral without my cap?

796
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:12,181
It's out there all alone
and I'm powerless to do anything about it.

797
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,975
We're entering enemy airspace.

798
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:21,857
Sir, it appears we have
unidentified radar contacts.

799
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:25,051
Looks like enemy
aircraft at 12 o'clock.

800
01:04:25,052 --> 01:04:28,614
Really? That gives us about...
25 minutes.

801
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,241
Think I'll step out for a burger.

802
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:42,127
Sir, there are six of them!
Bearing 2-1-5, range 150 mi...

803
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,258
Oh my God, a dozen more of them.

804
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:52,137
And a blimp! A big, shiny blimp,
and it's slowly moving south!

805
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:57,059
- Block, have you got a tally on the bandits?
- Roger that. I got 'em.

806
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:01,313
All right. Resume combat spread.
Attack formation Delta-niner.

807
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:04,984
Topper in the lead.
Just like your old man, son.

808
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:09,154
Old Buzz Harley'd be proud of you, Topper.

809
01:05:10,774 --> 01:05:13,484
He's the type that could end up
killing every man in this outfit.

810
01:05:13,568 --> 01:05:15,035
He's poison for morale of the unit.

811
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,496
Read... my... lips.

812
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:21,417
No... new... taxes.

813
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:25,379
- Topper, what are you doing?
- He's frozen! Topper's no good to us!

814
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:29,633
Abort the mission! Abort the mission!

815
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:31,510
Return to mother!

816
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,975
We can't! They're all over us!

817
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:52,781
- Damn it! All right, engage!
- I've got a bogie at 12 o'clock!

818
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,581
I got two on my tail!
Kowalski, get 'em off me.

819
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,210
Locked up! Fox two!

820
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,300
My missile didn't track!

821
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,802
My engine's cut out.
I'm losing power.

822
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:18,390
My cannons won't fire!
What's going on?

823
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:21,602
I've got two bandits on my six!

824
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:29,943
This is insane. Wilson and Rosener.

825
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:34,323
It was them, wasn't it?
They said nobody was gonna get hurt!

826
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,575
Block, call your men back.

827
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:41,205
Like hell I will! I got
the best pilot in the world up here.

828
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:43,707
Topper! Topper, do you read me?

829
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:48,921
I was there 20 years ago. I was there
with your father and Mailman Farnham.

830
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:52,716
I was an eyewitness.
You gotta listen to me, Topper.

831
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:54,843
What they said about your dad is wrong.

832
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,804
Eject, Mailman. Eject!

833
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,391
I can't! My seat's jammed!

834
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,559
- Nothing works!
- Stay calm!

835
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,813
- My harness is malfunctioning!
- I'll get it!

836
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:10,109
Buzz! The nose! The nose!

837
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,696
Whoa! Sit tight!

838
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,783
Whoa... Whoa!

839
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,494
Come on! Hurry!

840
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,916
Get the lead out!

841
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,961
It's gonna be OK!

842
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,632
Wow! That was sure close!

843
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:37,428
Buzz! Get back here!

844
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,098
Whoaaa!

845
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,142
Argh!

846
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:46,145
I'm OK!

847
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:50,899
Buzz! The wing! The wing!

848
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,234
Hurry!

849
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,864
What, are you on a break?

850
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:01,326
- Hurry!
- I'm here!

851
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:04,830
Hey, whose gum is this? Whoa!

852
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,541
Oh, for God's sake! Not now!

853
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:15,424
Got it! Hold on! We'll bring this baby down!

854
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,050
Stop squirming!

855
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:18,886
Hang on!

856
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:22,848
- Whoa!
- Those are my socks!

857
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,768
Buzz! Get back here!

858
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:30,147
Your father did everything
possible to save Mailman's life.

859
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:34,693
You should be proud, son.
Buzz Harley is a true American hero.

860
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:41,742
- I'm hit! I'm hit!
- Block, are you all right?

861
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,410
Yes! Yes!

862
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,704
Give 'em hell!

863
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:48,248
Got it! This is for you, Dad.

864
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:54,004
- They're on my tail.
- I'm with you, buddy.

865
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:57,925
Hang in there.

866
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:03,388
My guns are jammed.

867
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:05,182
They got tone on me!

868
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,185
I'm gonna have to do it the hard way.

869
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,272
Anybody home?

870
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,984
They fell for that one.

871
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:20,239
- Topper! Three bandits, 12 o'clock!
- I'm on 'em!

872
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,078
Here we go, loop de loop.

873
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:28,372
Couscous!

874
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,961
Learned this one from Paula Abdul.

875
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,428
Oldest trick in the book.

876
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,689
Catch me if you can, guys.
Here's an old Buzz Harley move.

877
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,319
- Oh, boys...
- Agh!

878
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:03,657
I'm on their tails. I've got 'em now.

879
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,372
Hey, buddy.

880
01:10:16,196 --> 01:10:17,646
It looks like they're buggin' out.

881
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,633
Yikes!

882
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:32,811
Saved by the clouds. Come on in, boys.

883
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,481
A little hide-and-seek.

884
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:44,698
See ya later, guys.

885
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:49,661
This could be the end
of a beautiful friendship.

886
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,667
Topper, look out!

887
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,837
I got two heat-seeking missiles on my tail.

888
01:11:00,465 --> 01:11:03,383
Block, Kent, Kowalski,
get the hell outta here.

889
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:07,846
Get back to the ship!
I got me a nuclear-weapons plant to wax.

890
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,682
- You're committing suicide!
- Do as he says!

891
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:16,521
We are getting close.

892
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,858
Missiles? Still with me. Come on.

893
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,367
If I can't lose 'em, I'll use 'em.

894
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:32,079
The mother of all targets.

895
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,376
Sayonara, Saddam.

896
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:46,301
Come in! Are you all right?
Topper, acknowledge!

897
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,887
- Topper, do you read?
- Topper, are you all right?

898
01:12:00,775 --> 01:12:01,900
There they are!

899
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,991
Uh, we're landing. Get out of the way.

900
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:13,328
Run for your lives!

901
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,801
- Where's Topper?
- Lost contact.

902
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,936
- There he is!
- Pyrex Pickle Blowfish.

903
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:41,231
Permission to land.

904
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:44,359
You'll have to talk me down.
I've got damage.

905
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:46,111
Hold it, hold it!

906
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,321
OK, Topper. Ease her in.

907
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:50,449
- Landing gear's frozen.
- Lookin' good.

908
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:53,910
- Lost my radar.
- A little more power now.

909
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:56,246
- I'm out of fuel.
- Right for lineup.

910
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,790
- Lost a wing.
- Doin' fine.

911
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:02,377
- There goes the other one.
- OK, Topper. Call the ball.

912
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:04,212
Touchin' down.

913
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,970
Wha-hoo!

914
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:17,684
Well done, Jim!

915
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:28,236
- You're quite a guy!
- So are you!

916
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:30,989
Hey! Wash Out!

917
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,992
Oh, Topper...

918
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:41,374
You.

919
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:49,299
- I got one question for you.
- Shoot.

920
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,635
What is a chafing dish for?

921
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:56,056
Why, it's a traditional serving piece
used at brunches to keep food warm.

922
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,643
- I thought that was a Crockpot.
- No, no, no.

923
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:02,604
That's for cooking all day. A chafing dish...

924
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:13,615
Hey, Topper! Now that you've
made the world safe for democracy,

925
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,326
what will you do
to cash in on your new-found fame?

926
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:18,411
I'm goin' to Disneyland!

927
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:28,338
You're very fortunate, Commander Block.
This man has your blood type.

928
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:32,759
Don't worry, sir. After this transfusion,
you're gonna be just fine.

929
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:36,805
I've only seen heroism like that
one other time.

930
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:40,308
Maybe you know the pilot:
Leland "Buzz" Harley.

931
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:45,438
I've been carrying this secret around
for 20 years.

932
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,315
I never spoke up.

933
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,110
I wanted him to fail.

934
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,571
I wanted to be number one.

935
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:55,073
And I was in love with your mother.

936
01:14:56,409 --> 01:15:00,871
It's not important now, sir. Please,
save your strength for your court martial.

937
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:03,999
Topper, you had me pegged right.

938
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,834
I was throwin' the big game.

939
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:06,960
Oh!

940
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,590
I really thought
we needed that other airplane.

941
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,970
But now I realise that
American planes'll always be superior

942
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:20,307
as long as there are
wonderful men like you in the cockpit

943
01:15:20,391 --> 01:15:22,017
and German parts.

944
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:27,189
I know you think it was me, but it was
Wilson and Rosener who sabotaged the jets.

945
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:30,192
They played me like a two-bit piccolo.

946
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:33,737
Oh! Oh...

947
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,164
Whoaaaaa!

948
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:47,667
I can see my house from here!

949
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,756
Oh no, you don't.

950
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,344
- Admiral!
- You call yourself an American?

951
01:15:57,428 --> 01:16:02,057
That gets my panties in a bunch.
It's scum like you that taint our military.

952
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:04,450
You don't know what
you're talking about.

953
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:06,978
You risked the lives
of some fine pilots.

954
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,190
Well, that's my job.

955
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,573
Is it safe?

956
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:33,713
You look good up there, son.

957
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:01,700
I think I'm wearing your pants.

958
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,719
- Ramada!
- Kent!

959
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:31,730
- You're OK.
- Ramada.

960
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,649
You must put me out of your mind.

961
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:39,237
There's a certain flyboy aboard that ship
that needs you far more than I.

962
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:42,574
- You must forget me.
- No problem. I will.

963
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,826
Please... Not a tear.

964
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:49,039
Don't look back. That's my brave girl.

965
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:56,171
Don't worry, little one!
As long as I have me, I'll survive!

966
01:17:58,132 --> 01:17:59,758
Aarghhh!

967
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:20,862
Topper!

968
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,456
Go, Bill, go!

969
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,166
Topper!

970
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:34,959
Wait!

971
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,963
Whoa!

972
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:41,132
Topper!

973
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:33,685
Ramada.

974
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:38,606
Once, perhaps.
Now I'm called Wawatukeena.

975
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,860
- What does it mean?
- Little Sizzling Belly.

976
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:05,925
Every night I hope and pray

977
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:09,345
A dream lover will come my way

978
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:13,099
A girl to hold in my arms

979
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:15,977
And know the magic of her charms

980
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:18,062
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

981
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:19,939
- A girl
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

982
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:21,733
- To call
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

983
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,109
- My own
- Yeah-yeah

984
01:20:23,194 --> 01:20:25,528
I want a dream lover

985
01:20:25,613 --> 01:20:29,365
I don't have to dream alone

986
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:34,746
Dream lover, where are you

987
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:38,500
With a love, oh, so true?

988
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:42,212
And a hand that I can hold

989
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:45,006
To feel you near as I grow old?

990
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,841
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

991
01:20:46,926 --> 01:20:48,885
- A girl
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

992
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,720
- To call
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

993
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,013
- My own
- Yeah-yeah

994
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,516
I want a dream lover

995
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,645
I don't have to dream alone

996
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:04,067
Some day, I don't know how

997
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:07,445
I know she'll hear my plea

998
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:11,115
Some way, I don't know how

999
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,744
She'll bring her love to me

1000
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:18,373
Dream lover, until then

1001
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:21,876
I'll go to sleep, I'll dream again

1002
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:25,672
That's the only thing to do

1003
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:28,591
Till all my lover's dreams come true

1004
01:21:28,676 --> 01:21:30,802
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

1005
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,220
- A girl
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

1006
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,264

01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:38,059
I want a dream lover

1009
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:41,521
I don't have to dream alone

1010
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:47,402
Dream lover, until then

1011
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:50,822
I'll go to sleep, I'll dream again

1012
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,659
That's the only thing to do

1013
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:57,579
Till all my lover's dreams come true

1014
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:59,664
- Because I want
- Yeah-yeah, yeah

1015
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,499

I want a dream lover

1019
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:10,675
I don't have to dream alone

1020
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:15,263
