1
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,046
Where the hell is Mrs. Sulee's house!

2
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:00,881
This way!

3
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,450
Mrs.! Mrs.!

4
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:09,992
Mrs.! Hurry up! Mrs. Sulee!

5
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,723
Open up please! We need your help!

6
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:08,085
Be strong, Sulee will help you!

7
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,101
It's a Cambodian curse.

8
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,169
<i>ART OF THE DEVIL II</i>

9
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,279
When people are under stress,
the human brain will work harder.

10
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,882
When people are under stress,
the human brain will work harder.

11
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:19,113
What happens afterwards
is called an anxiety disorder.

12
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,755
The symptoms will be clearly noticed...

13
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,417
...when the person has mild to severe
headaches, and is agitated easily.

14
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,598
People with anxiety disorders will also
have sweaty palms, and be easily
distracted.

15
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:40,700
For those that are not
treated, suicides are common.

16
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:45,567
Okay, that's all for today, and
don't forget to do your assignment.

17
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,840
Hey! If you guys want to make
out, do it outside the classroom.

18
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,885
Some people in here are trying to learn.

19
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,319
Hello, Ta, is that you?

20
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,251
What is it?

21
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,966
Just spit it out. I don't
have all day, you know.

22
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:52,836
I've got a lot of studying
to do, and I'm tired. Goodbye.

23
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,185
Por! What the heck is your problem!

24
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,652
Surprise! Happy Birthday!

25
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,791
It was a joke!

26
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:15,530
Oh really? A joke huh?

27
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,833
Hey! Kim, we've been friends forever.

28
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,473
You know how I feel about you.

29
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:08,010
I want to know if we can
be more than just friends.

30
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,828
I think this is a bit more than friends.

31
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,028
Hello?

32
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:31,276
Hello? It's for you, Por.

33
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,445
Hello?

34
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,441
Ta!

35
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,986
What? Since when did Ta's dad die?

36
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,713
Yeah, yeah. it's actually good this way.

37
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,487
I haven't seen Ta since we graduated.

38
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,125
Hey there! When did this happen, Por?

39
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,229
Great...

40
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:59,897
This way we can hang out
together just like the old days!

41
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,934
What? Noot? Oh she's
the same, never changes.

42
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:08,308
<i>Lover boy, let's be real close.</i>
<i>As for true love, nobody knows.</i>

43
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,282
<i>My wife I love so much.</i>

44
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,546
Why am I going?

45
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,112
I already told you! I'm going
on a trip with my friends!

46
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,183
Listen, if you want me
to go back, pick me up!

47
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,654
Otherwise, don't even
bother calling! Goodbye!

48
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,729
Who were you talking to?

49
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:27,924
No one.

50
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,558
Come on, let's go. Our train is here.

51
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,976
Shut up, Ko. Don't even
bother getting aboard!

52
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,439
Go away!

53
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,414
Two years after our
high school's graduation...

54
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,958
...we all seem changed somehow, from
a regular group of rural school kids...

55
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,516
...to the grown ups we are now.

56
00:09:56,228 --> 00:10:02,098
But for me, it's as if the
memories of our old path...

57
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,036
...slowly are emerging into clear sight.

58
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:14,406
If life is filled with
many paths to take...

59
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,145
...then what's most important...

60
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,185
...are all the junctions where we
choose...

61
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,013
...and how it shapes our futures.

62
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:31,691
For me, this event made me realize that
the future comes from our wishes.

63
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,956
As for our past, it actually defines us.

64
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,239
<i>2 YEARS AGO</i>

65
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:13,969
Kim!

66
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,970
I'll read it as soon as I can.

67
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,673
I better get going.

68
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,477
Hurry up, slow poke!

69
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,847
So that's why you are always late!
Been hitting on the chicks here, huh?

70
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,855
You're slick, you know
that? Go ahead, drive on!

71
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,690
Hey Kim, what is it? May I see it?

72
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,720
Don't be silly.

73
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,525
He's a cute guy, and the
district's top athlete too!

74
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,100
Come on, knock it off!

75
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,631
Kim, watch out, Kaew is right there.

76
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,309
There are kids everywhere here.

77
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,106
Oh, they're just here to help
the teacher check the homework.

78
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,978
Here is the money.

79
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,448
You want a smoke?

80
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,296
Oh, no thanks. The
teacher wouldn't like that.

81
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,328
Hey, Por, pass me another one.

82
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,760
Ko! Stop fooling around!

83
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,830
Ko! Careful with the marks,
you're going to mess it up!

84
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,030
Why the weird patterns?

85
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,231
Nothing wrong with a little zig zag.

86
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,773
To heck with the zig zags.

87
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,206
A zig zag line to love, babe.

88
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,775
Cut it out.

89
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,122
I've got dessert for us.

90
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,921
Wow, that's so generous of you,
Teacher!

91
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,986
Ko, careful there with the drawings!

92
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,730
So how is it with the grading?

93
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,463
We're almost done now.

94
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,361
Can I see?

95
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,799
Ko slacked off a lot.

96
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,897
Kim, you're skilled with your English!

97
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,001
Why don't you eat dear?

98
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,514
You came all the way to my house and...

99
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:06,445
...if you go back without
trying my famous pickled mangos...

100
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,611
...you're going to miss
out on something good.

101
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:09,916
Thank you.

102
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,956
Mom, I need 1000 baht.

103
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,623
I'll be right back, kids.

104
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,106
She is really a nice teacher.

105
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,368
Her brother Ta asked for money
and she didn't even hesitate.

106
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,241
That Nong is a momma’s boy.

107
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,678
But Ta here, is a daddy’s boy.

108
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,716
In this house, the
mother has the upper hand.

109
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,312
Hey, who hit my head?

110
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,612
Want to race? Hurry up!

111
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:53,564
Por, when Ko said that Ta is a
daddy’s boy, what did he mean by that?

112
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,235
Oh, Ta is Prawaet's son.

113
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,633
Mr. Prawaet fell in love with Mrs.
Panor after Ta's real mom died.

114
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,635
Anyway, our teacher, Panor
gave birth to Nong later.

115
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,834
Ta favors his father
more than our teacher, Panor.

116
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,774
You see Ta being so studious,
but it's all for his dad's sake.

117
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,404
Hang on Kim. See you later, Ta!

118
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,010
Kim, Kim...

119
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,556
We're here.

120
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,925
Hey, Ta...

121
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:34,836
Ta!

122
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,710
Ta! How are you!

123
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,334
Did you miss us or what?

124
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,913
I missed all of you guys.

125
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,242
Hey Ta!

126
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,343
Sorry about your dad and all.

127
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,918
You doing all right?

128
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,285
I'm fine, and you?

129
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:02,162
Haven't seen you in a while Kim. You
okay?

130
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,967
I'm okay.

131
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,270
Let's go guys. Your dad
is waiting for us by now.

132
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,739
Ko, you and your filthy mouth!

133
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,645
Hey buddy, check out Noot.
Haven't seen her for two years.

134
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,743
Now, she got a great
body, don't you think?

135
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,253
What I wouldn't do to get me some of
that.

136
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,256
You want some? I'll
share. It's all good.

137
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,467
Ta, so what's up with that story?

138
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,570
Are you going to fill
us in or what?

139
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,429
Well, after you guys
graduated...

140
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,300
Mom had problem after problem.

141
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,141
Actually, I just came back home.

142
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,576
Wait up, so where have you been?

143
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,909
Disciplinary school. Nong
was the one with the problems.

144
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,382
But I couldn't help in time.

145
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,716
He drowned on purpose. I
got caught as the scapegoat.

146
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,348
After that, dad shot himself.

147
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:06,190
I just got released actually, so now I can
take care of my father's funeral.

148
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,429
It was a long time ago, buddy.

149
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,799
I think you should just forget about it.

150
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,465
Hey, why don't we talk
about all this at Ta's house.

151
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,805
It's hot and muggy here.

152
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,240
Noot, let's go.

153
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,586
Look over there!

154
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,217
There's something going on over there!

155
00:16:59,018 --> 00:16:59,916
Stop! You are under arrest!

156
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,186
Ko, take Nong with you.

157
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,278
Get down on the ground!

158
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,852
You know these hooligans?

159
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:13,858
No.

160
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,395
Remember this 'til the day you die.

161
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,434
If you want to screw your life
up somewhere, it's your business.

162
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,872
Just don't bring my
son into it! Do you understand me?

163
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,737
You retard! The both
of you, father and son!

164
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,745
Hey! Insult me, not dad. He's
got nothing to do with this.

165
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,975
You dare raise your voice with me?

166
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,915
How dare you even talk back
to me! You pathetic bastard!

167
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,018
Ta!

168
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,289
That's enough! Come on.

169
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,689
And as for you, calm down. Stop
it already. Come on, let's go.

170
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,629
Fine! You hate me so much.

171
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:50,028
Just remember, when you are a low
life thief, you'll remember this day.

172
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,410
Ta, you are something, you know that.

173
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,080
How come you have to hate her so
much?

174
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:15,520
If not for yourself, then have
some sympathy for me at least.

175
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,569
After some rubbing ointment,
you'll probably feel better.

176
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,964
Remember, just don't do it again.

177
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:40,645
One more thing, I want you to love
Nong.

178
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,785
He is your only brother
at the very least.

179
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,762
Wow, this is cool! It's
like heaven.

180
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,462
I love it here!

181
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,601
Take it easy there. Easy does it.

182
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,148
Check it out! Pawn's
stuff is really good.

183
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,810
They say it's from Cambodian rituals.

184
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,347
Nong even came here to do his tattoo.

185
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,250
No knife or blade can
cut through his skin.

186
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,950
Ta? You've seen it, right?

187
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,858
You first, Ko.

188
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,500
Drink up! Drink up!

189
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,232
Cheers!

190
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,376
Everyone who's not my student, get out.

191
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,481
So now you are learning
to drink? Are you not?

192
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,157
Coach...

193
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,629
Shut up! Who said you could talk?

194
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,161
What is your ID number?

195
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,030
Hey!

196
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,199
Want to be a bully?

197
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,201
You want to drink? Want to be a drunk?

198
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,606
Come here! Come here!

199
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:12,505
Drinking!

200
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,371
Drunken students!

201
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,405
Tomorrow, bring your parents.

202
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,039
I'm going to make you remember this.

203
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,869
You believe him too?

204
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,738
His words aren't believable!

205
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,376
He causes problems everyday.

206
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,673
Him and his crazy friends just got into
trouble with the officials...

207
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,008
...if you remember!

208
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,348
You think it over.
It's his word over mine!

209
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:07,831
Ta, I've told you countless times
not to bad mouth your stepmother.

210
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,428
But dad! I saw them together.

211
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,999
Make sure this never happens again!

212
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,775
Dad...

213
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:26,475
We still have to do our daily
cleaning chores in that room...

214
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,383
...I say lets steal that
camera and put it to good use.

215
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,948
Ta, listen to me man, if you
do this both the coach and...

216
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:40,689
...our teacher, Panor can
kiss their futures goodbye.

217
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,231
Who's there?

218
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,339
Hurry up! Why are you
still standing here?

219
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,305
Hey! Stop it!

220
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,110
Come back here!

221
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:01,618
Tair!

222
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:16,433
You all know that you've
just finished up your probation.

223
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,969
And now that you have stolen school
equipment, it will mean expulsion.

224
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,974
I have to hand you over to the police.

225
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,572
Coach, I'm begging you not
to call the police on us.

226
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,687
This would mean I need
something in return.

227
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,691
May I?

228
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:53,464
No. Please stop. I'm begging you.

229
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,067
Please, I'm begging you.

230
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,984
Let's get out of here!

231
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:17,453
Go on!

232
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,688
Stop it right there!

233
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,249
Other than theft of school property...

234
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:45,720
...you'll be charged with
battery and assault.

235
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,123
You all want to go to jail or what?

236
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:52,252
You are really asking for
jail time? What about you?

237
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,926
What the hell are you doing!

238
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:08,003
But don't worry, I've got just
the thing to set you all free.

239
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:10,745
You bastard.

240
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,182
Stop! You better not touch
her! You're not human!

241
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,818
You low life!

242
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,491
You let me go this instant!
You hear me? Stop it! Bastard!

243
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,689
Let me go! You bastard!

244
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,395
Stop it!

245
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:27,794
No!

246
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:30,660
You bastard!

247
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,627
Let go of me!

248
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,669
Damn!

249
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:43,742
Before you decided to come here to
see me, you've thought it over already?

250
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,414
It's like riding on the back of a tiger.

251
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,381
You never know when it
will turn around and bite.

252
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,284
I'm just warning you all.

253
00:24:52,023 --> 00:25:02,263
Things of this nature, once tried, it
will stick with you 'til the day you die.

254
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,132
Understand?

255
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:17,040
The way to do this right, you
have to get proper mediums.

256
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:22,586
Birth dates...

257
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,585
Personal photo...

258
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,587
Personal property...

259
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:37,395
Lastly, you need the dirt he steps upon.

260
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,872
Can you get me all those things?

261
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,375
Don't even think of opening your eyes.

262
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,651
Good day there.

263
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,284
Good day to you.

264
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,660
The food here is good.
I eat here all the time.

265
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,758
Hey guys, did you hear
about the coach? He's dead!

266
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,999
How many time I have to tell you, Ko?

267
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,294
No more talk about that incident.

268
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,807
Anyone seen Ta around?

269
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,544
What's going on?

270
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,012
What's happening?

271
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,912
Hey, where are you going?

272
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,143
Let's go find out.

273
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,125
Get out of the way!

274
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,600
Hey Ta, are you listening?

275
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,736
Uh, yeah. I'm listening.

276
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,472
So, what happened after that?

277
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,572
I wondered, why your stepmom never
went to your father's cremation.

278
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,583
Or is she still angry about it all?

279
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,380
She's back making her living
selling pickled mangoes again.

280
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:14,282
I don't know man, I just live
my life, and she has her own.

281
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,882
We don't talk much.

282
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,997
Come on Kim. Careful there.

283
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,880
That's fifty baht each?

284
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:13,813
Yes.

285
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,709
Here's the money.

286
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,585
Thanks for the ride.

287
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:34,797
Sir, you gave us the wrong change!

288
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,133
Oh, hello there, grandmother.

289
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,268
We'll be staying on this side.

290
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:46,539
If it isn't necessary, don't go
over there and bother grandma.

291
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:53,182
Oh boy, your room's a mess.

292
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,019
It's livable.

293
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,185
You guys just leave
your stuff here for now.

294
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:04,462
First go pay respects to the shrine,
while I make your beds up. All right?

295
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,027
Sure thing. Come on, let's go.

296
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,541
Come on, Kim.

297
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,276
Por, do you think that teacher
Panor will be happy to see us?

298
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,581
Um, I'm not too sure.

299
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:21,774
Oh for crying out loud.

300
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:26,118
Just tell Kim that you're not sure if our
teacher Panor is still crazy or not!

301
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,657
Hurry up! Hurry up!

302
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,990
Quicken up the pace!

303
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,902
Work hard. Hurry up.

304
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,919
Teacher, are you...

305
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,383
I mean how are things?

306
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,990
And what about you kids?
How do you think I am?

307
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,964
You're still beautiful.

308
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,600
I'm old now.

309
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,512
Um, what's the matter, teacher?

310
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,617
Oh my uncle's calling me.

311
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,519
Excuse me.

312
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:35,923
Hello.

313
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,363
I hear that my students all moved out
of here to the big city of Bangkok.

314
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,799
How is it there? Further study?

315
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,494
Por is a law student...

316
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,938
...while Ko over here is
an engineering student.

317
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:56,977
Noot is studying English and
preparing to go to Australia with Tair.

318
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,779
You are always the chatty girl.

319
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,683
And from the number two
student of the class, too.

320
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,891
Well, I'm flattered by that.

321
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,327
But I'd be proud if I was
number one instead of two.

322
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,687
So what field are you
studying in these days?

323
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,195
I'm studying to be a doctor.

324
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,026
Really? Is it true, Mister?

325
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,766
You're not pulling my chain
or anything like that, are you?

326
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,937
Yes, yes I'll try to find a
way to go as quickly as I can.

327
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,007
Hello? Hello?

328
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,578
Anyone here have a signal?

329
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,647
Can I borrow your
phone to call back home?

330
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:34,275
No luck.

331
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,844
There is no signal here.

332
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,520
You can only get a signal by
that old shrine over there.

333
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,850
Oh great, what am I going to do?

334
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,122
Noot? What's the urgency?

335
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,794
Well, right now my
dad is in the hospital...

336
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:51,095
And my uncle is waiting
for me at the train station.

337
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,702
So I don't think I can stay.

338
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,169
Woah, really?

339
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,206
So you really have to go back right
now?

340
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,410
Don't be angry at me. Please?

341
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,207
I really have to go back. All right?

342
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,748
Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

343
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:15,292
Wow! What a view! Next time,
call us before things get hot!

344
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,191
Hey Ko, shut it already!

345
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:19,692
Oh man...

346
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,287
Noot! Are you finished yet?

347
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,957
The teacher told us to come get you.

348
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,729
Yeah, just finish up doing
what you girls do, and let's go!

349
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:26,995
Screw you!

350
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,374
Hey, thinking of Noot's tongue?

351
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,279
I'll let you borrow mine for now.

352
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,818
You're really asking for it!

353
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,652
Any of you guys seen Ta around?

354
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,720
I can't find him anywhere.

355
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,360
I saw him in the garden over there.

356
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:02,672
Por, I think Ta is uncomfortable with
you and Kim being couples and all.

357
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,633
You should clear it up with Ta.

358
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,614
Ta, have you thought
of your future at all?

359
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:25,658
I think of it all the time and
I put great effort into it.

360
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:30,228
I made the cut for my
studies as a doctor and...

361
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,166
...mom and pop are
really happy about it.

362
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,939
I really want to give it my best shot.

363
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,077
We should split up.

364
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:51,652
Kim! I don't understand!

365
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,416
I am proud of you and your grades.

366
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,219
But I don't see why we
can't still see each other.

367
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,729
You don't understand.

368
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,493
You're right. I don't understand.

369
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,395
I don't get why we have to break up.

370
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,936
You wanted to know everything
about me and I've told you.

371
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,968
What else do I have to do?

372
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:12,207
Ta, let me go! You're hurting me!

373
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,870
Everything that happened... I
didn't start it! You understand?

374
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,075
Tell me the real
reason why. Why the breakup?

375
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,150
Let go of me!

376
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:26,347
I just want to choose what's good
for me and, you're not the one for me!

377
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,822
You're not the one!

378
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,689
Damn!

379
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,919
Por, if you keep doing
that, I'll really be angry.

380
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:50,471
Por, did you hear something just now?

381
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:53,209
What sound?

382
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:58,076
It's nothing. Probably the wind.

383
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,349
Um, Kim?

384
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:06,952
If you're finished, I'd
like a word with you.

385
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,222
I have something to say.

386
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,063
So do I.

387
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:18,896
Ta...

388
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,733
Sometimes I feel that
I am the guilty one.

389
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,831
You can probably see that
Por and I are a couple now.

390
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:31,108
It was my decision.
It's not Por's fault.

391
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,949
If it was anyone was wrong, it would be
me.

392
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,879
Kim...

393
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:45,091
For the past two years, I've
tried to get in touch with you.

394
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,563
But you never cared for me.

395
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,361
I never forgot you, Kim.

396
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,108
Please don't do that again.

397
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:03,142
Forget the past.

398
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,940
Let's go back to all our friends.

399
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,684
Where did they all go?

400
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,733
Ta!

401
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,414
It's freezing!

402
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,417
You guys are something!

403
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:46,989
I win!

404
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,685
Nice idea for fun.

405
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,634
Ta, you cold or something?

406
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,634
I swallowed some of the water.

407
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,280
I saw someone under the water!

408
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,582
You're seeing things! We're
the only ones in the water.

409
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,952
Hey Ta, your grandma skinny dipping?

410
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:24,686
Piss off!

411
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:33,259
It's amazing that two years have past
and everything is still the same.

412
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,170
I think I feel something has changed.

413
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,805
No seriously, I think
something has changed.

414
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,053
I saw it.

415
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,214
Ko, what did you see?

416
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,948
Ko, what did you see?

417
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,785
Breasts! Round mounds!

418
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,724
Cut it out, Ko!

419
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,200
Tair, call me when you
decide not to be gay.

420
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:31,455
Teacher, what's cooking?

421
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,661
Smells good. Spicy
chicken broth looks good.

422
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,835
If it looks good, take the whole pot.

423
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:46,773
And over there is
plenty of fish curry pie.

424
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,174
Let's setup for dinner!

425
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,876
Hey, kitty, kitty.

426
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,918
Want to eat with us, huh?

427
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,594
You're not going to eat with us?

428
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:09,063
Help yourself, I already had my share.

429
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,329
I'm going to meditate
and pray for a while.

430
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,771
Is there anything wrong, teacher?

431
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:25,477
You know, the more I see you kids,
the more I want to go back and teach.

432
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:44,890
Here kitty kitty. Where are you?

433
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,127
Come and get your dinner.

434
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,683
Here kitty kitty.

435
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,121
I'm going to leave it right here.

436
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,736
Kim!

437
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:27,843
Grandma!

438
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,915
Grandma! You can't eat that, grandma!

439
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,712
Stop eating it, grandma!

440
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,411
You kids don't care for
me! I'm hungry! Hungry!

441
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,749
You guys, help me out will you?

442
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,847
She is senile. She doesn't
know what she's eating!

443
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,222
Grandma, no. You need to get
some sleep. I'll take you.

444
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,353
But I'm starving. I can't go to sleep.

445
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,454
I'm hungry!

446
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,705
Hey Ta, how is your grandmother?

447
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:17,516
Don't worry, she's just senile.

448
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,853
Don't fret over it.

449
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,429
Hey, take it easy there.

450
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,569
Tair, are you scared?

451
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,304
Me, scared? I'm scared of nothing.

452
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,844
But I'm scared.

453
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:39,379
I think there's something weird about
this place. Ever since this evening.

454
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:56,157
Today, we have many guests in the
house.

455
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:01,362
Mother will have to
dress up nice and pretty.

456
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,165
You should too, my son.

457
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:07,934
You will probably need
to clean up a bit as well.

458
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:22,147
You may be with the three eyed
god, but I'm still worried for you.

459
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:28,723
You have to understand. I'm
doing this for your own good.

460
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:35,465
Go stay with the three eyed
god. So you will be clean.

461
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,485
Mother will have to clean you up now.

462
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:01,116
So that you will be clean, my dear.

463
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,873
We've already paid our respects
to the gods of these grounds.

464
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:24,208
I don't think there will be
any more problems from now on.

465
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,112
Let's go eat.

466
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,971
Um, this is delicious!

467
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:01,411
Hey Ko, stop being a pig. Use a spoon.

468
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,341
What? I'm starving.

469
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:20,228
It's just the sound of the wooden floor.

470
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,102
Ko! That's disgusting!

471
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,704
You can't handle a burp?
Here, have another one.

472
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,020
You freaking bastard
child. You're unclean!

473
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,683
Tair? What did you just say?

474
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:54,158
What? I didn't say anything.

475
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:59,228
This chicken soup is delicious!

476
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:03,503
Thank you.

477
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,043
Hey Ko. Stop hogging up the food.

478
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,108
Hey, try some of this.

479
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:27,295
Noot! The meat in the soup is Noot's!

480
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,046
Ta! Your stepmom isn't
completely sane yet, is she?

481
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,490
Ta, where is she?

482
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:02,157
I'm going to see downstairs.
She might be downstairs.

483
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,494
Kim?

484
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:54,347
Hey Kim!

485
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:55,007
Kim!

486
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,176
Wake up Kim!

487
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:57,184
What's wrong with her?

488
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:58,877
Kim!

489
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,114
Kim!

490
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,736
You guys check this out.

491
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:59,776
Why is Teacher Panor doing this?

492
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:04,676
You guys remember what
Mr. Pawn told us that day?

493
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:07,780
You must eat the flesh
of those you release.

494
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:11,355
In order to gain the powers from them.

495
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:16,795
And why did she do that?

496
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:25,907
Or is it because she hasn't
forgotten about the past.

497
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:31,774
I think you should get her
on video for your dad as proof.

498
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,815
Yeah, I think that's a great idea!

499
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,879
That way, dad will finally
believe me for once.

500
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:41,046
Plus, while we're at it, might
as well show the whole school.

501
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,055
What do you think?

502
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:46,558
Good! The visions you want...

503
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,265
I'll let you see to your satisfaction.

504
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:57,398
Ta? Say something.

505
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,603
Your mom doesn't know anything?

506
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:05,142
I already told you that
for the past 2 years...

507
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:06,905
I wasn't here with her.

508
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,869
Tair? What's wrong?

509
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,722
Tair? What's the matter?

510
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,986
Calm down, Tair!

511
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:52,325
Tair!

512
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:57,060
Por! Let's all get out of here! Please!

513
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:00,864
Come on! Let's go!

514
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:13,010
A boat! Help us!

515
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:19,281
Help!! Help us! Over here!

516
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,619
Damn!

517
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:28,624
Over there!

518
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:34,298
Help us! Save us! Over here! Save us!

519
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,078
Don't interfere!

520
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:57,716
Kim!

521
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:01,187
Ta!

522
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,322
Kim!

523
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,803
You want to leave me? Huh?

524
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:17,710
I think you won't be able to do that.

525
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:24,816
If you can't walk away, then you
won't leave me. Is that correct?

526
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:26,611
What do you think?

527
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:38,055
Kim.

528
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:43,062
Kim, are you all right?

529
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,360
Hurry up!

530
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:47,129
Kim? How is she?

531
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,310
Kim? How is she?

532
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,542
Ta. Just now I saw something.

533
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,220
Kim?

534
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,311
That's my dad's gun.

535
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:39,351
Kim. How did you know
where to find that?

536
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,955
I don't know.

537
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:45,490
But in my visions, I saw it falling out
of his father's hand and land here.

538
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,908
There's someone in there!

539
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,690
Ta! That's your dad! T a!

540
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,635
What the hell is going on here?

541
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,298
How can this be?

542
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:40,100
We went to your father's
cremation, didn't we?

543
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,207
I was probably fooled the
same way you guys got fooled.

544
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:14,734
Tair. What exactly are you seeing?

545
01:00:20,817 --> 01:00:24,150
Quickly, everyone hold
her down! Tair! Calm down.

546
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,722
Let's take her to the sacred room!

547
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,659
Hey guys, hurry up!

548
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,968
Tair! What's wrong?

549
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,940
Calm down. Get a grip of yourself!

550
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,271
I'm not going!

551
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,379
Let's go!

552
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,949
Let me go!

553
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:00,147
Let me go!

554
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,885
Tair! Tair! Tair!

555
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:05,326
Kim!

556
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,658
Help me! Por, help me please!

557
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:08,727
Kim!

558
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:09,593
Kim!

559
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:15,399
Help me please!

560
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:16,629
Kim!

561
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:23,874
Get me out of here! Open up the doors!

562
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:24,947
Kim!

563
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,746
I forgot to tell you there is
another way into the sacred room.

564
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,040
Kim!

565
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:32,744
It's okay Kim. You're safe now.

566
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,152
If we stay in here, we should be safe.

567
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:46,598
I want you to confess!

568
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:48,829
Out of all you people
here, who is the mastermind?

569
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,974
I'm going to teach you all a lesson.

570
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:55,175
Who?

571
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,077
You?

572
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,776
Or you?

573
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:09,451
Please help me. I don't want to die.

574
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,317
I confess I was wrong.

575
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,123
I don't want to die
yet. Help me, please?

576
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,790
Tair calm down.

577
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:18,728
Tair?

578
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:22,332
Tair calm down.

579
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,841
I shouldn't have been involved.

580
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,042
I shouldn't have been involved!

581
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:31,906
Tair...

582
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,642
For crying out loud! Shut up for once!

583
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,975
What good is crying going to do!

584
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,644
We already have enough to deal
with, let alone your crying!

585
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,449
You freaking shut your mouth, Ko!

586
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,282
You and your filthy mouth!

587
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:48,227
I want to know, between me and
you, who's going to die first!

588
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:51,425
Didn't I tell you to shut it?

589
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,565
That's right, I'm not going to shut up.

590
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:54,499
I said shut your hole!

591
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,095
What are you going to do about it, Ko?

592
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,606
You guys stay away from me too!

593
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:05,975
If I hadn't known all of you, today I
wouldn't be here to see shit like this!

594
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,145
I said, shut up Tair!

595
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,377
We wouldn't have planned it out! We
wouldn't have to shoot that video!

596
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,611
We wouldn't have gotten into trouble!

597
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,685
We wouldn't have been sexually
abused by that damn coach!

598
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,620
We wouldn't have to eat Noot's flesh!

599
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,351
Tair! Tair! Tair!

600
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,360
That's enough!

601
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,560
Now will you shut up?

602
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:28,426
Didn't we all agree to never
mention that incident ever again?

603
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,134
Tair, you listen up!

604
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,844
Right now, everyone is
scared just as you are.

605
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:41,740
But what you have to do
now is calm down. Focus!

606
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:43,079
Do you understand?

607
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,656
Come on, let's all pray.

608
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:54,924
Let's pray that Buddha will protect us.

609
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,989
Tair, what the hell
are you laughing about?

610
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,425
What the hell are you all praying about!

611
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:36,469
Nothing can protect bad people like
you!

612
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,262
Tair! What the heck
is the matter with you?

613
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,557
I told you to stop it! You hear me!

614
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,292
Por, shoot her! She's not Tair anymore!

615
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:09,699
Por! Don't do it!

616
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:12,569
Teacher Panor, please... don't
hurt us. I'm afraid!

617
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:15,108
Let us go please!

618
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,576
Shoot her! Shoot her!

619
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:19,314
Damn you!

620
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:20,808
Ko! Get a grip, don't do it!

621
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,514
You dare raise your voice to me!

622
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:28,655
Ko!

623
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:34,819
Talk! You and your
filthy mouth of yours!

624
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:38,331
Now is your chance to talk!
Talk! Why don't you talk?

625
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,370
Ko! What the hell is wrong!

626
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:47,305
Hey Ko! What's the matter with you?

627
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,801
Ko! Can you hear me?

628
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:51,607
Ko! Damn!

629
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,381
Ko! Ko! Hey man!

630
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:58,018
Tair! Wake up! Tair!

631
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:00,188
Tair! Wake up please! Tair!

632
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,157
Hey! Ko!

633
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:08,825
Ko!

634
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:12,463
Ko!

635
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:16,468
Ko!

636
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:57,777
Ko!

637
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,269
Ko!

638
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:01,444
Ko!

639
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:18,965
What are we going to do now?

640
01:07:21,137 --> 01:07:23,367
Since we can't get out
of here, that means...

641
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:32,646
...that wacked out teacher is somewhere
around here, placing spells on us!

642
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:36,041
Por, you mean, you want us to...

643
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:39,644
That's right. It's our
turn to mess with her!

644
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,649
I'm not going! I'm not going anywhere!

645
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:44,157
We should stay right here!

646
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:48,620
Kim, you stay and look after her.

647
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:52,230
Ta, you're coming with me.

648
01:07:58,607 --> 01:07:59,801
Wait!

649
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:03,805
Be careful!

650
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,175
The both of you.

651
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:22,586
Kim, don't you leave me here.

652
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,629
They are all around us!

653
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:29,997
I don't want to see them!

654
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:32,073
Tair! What do you see?

655
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,170
Who do you see?

656
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:37,444
You really see them,
don't you? Where are they?

657
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:43,747
Where are they? Tair! Where are they?

658
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:48,689
Tair, where are you going?

659
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:57,960
Let's check over there!

660
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:10,370
Tair! Where are you?

661
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:13,710
Tair, wait!

662
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,115
Kim!

663
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:24,620
Ta, wait up man!

664
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:26,821
Ta!

665
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:55,648
Come out, show yourself!

666
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,176
Kim!

667
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:27,179
Kim!

668
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:34,157
Kim! You okay?

669
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:48,404
I've got you!

670
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,048
You're ok now.

671
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:05,716
This is gonna hurt!

672
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,298
Sit for a while.

673
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:31,379
Ta, you go check on Por.

674
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,481
I can't walk anymore.

675
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,653
You sure you're going
to be all right here?

676
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,444
Stay away from me!

677
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:05,850
Keep away from me!

678
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,549
I don't want to see any of you!

679
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:10,659
Tair.

680
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:16,695
Get away from me!

681
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:20,701
Tair. It's ok.

682
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:23,394
I'm here now. You're with me.

683
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:26,508
You'll be fine. I'm right with you.

684
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,235
Tair, what's wrong with you?

685
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:31,343
Stay away from me!

686
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,042
Stay away from me!

687
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:35,683
Don't you come closer!

688
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:37,975
Tair. It's okay.

689
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,754
Tair! Stop it!

690
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,346
Don't you come closer!

691
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,722
Tair! Where are you going, Tair?

692
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,224
Get away from me!

693
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:47,761
Tair.

694
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:50,888
Go away! I don't want to see any of you!

695
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,432
Get away from me!

696
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:54,025
Tair.

697
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:56,536
I don't want to see anymore!

698
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:03,872
I won't be able to see you anymore!

699
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:16,282
Tair, stop!

700
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:24,155
I won't see you anymore! I can't see!

701
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:39,247
Tair! Tair!

702
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,715
Tair!

703
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:58,529
Kim!

704
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:02,862
Tair?

705
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:07,168
Kim!

706
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,607
Kim! Kim!

707
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:14,113
There you go, Kim.

708
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:20,553
It's all right Kim. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

709
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,055
I'm right here with you now.

710
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,552
So now, you don't love me anymore?

711
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,959
Por, what's wrong with you?

712
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:34,095
What's the matter now?

713
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:36,860
Didn't you just point a gun at me?

714
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,132
You really think you can shoot me?

715
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:43,211
Por! Por! Don't do it!

716
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:45,638
Shoot me!

717
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:47,611
Shoot!

718
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:50,276
I said shoot me!

719
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:53,085
Pull the trigger!

720
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,053
Por! No!

721
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,761
Damn you Ta! Get out of the
way! I'm going to kill her!

722
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:05,165
Are you nuts?

723
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,132
<i>Get away from her!</i>
Are you nuts?

724
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:07,730
Come on Kim!

725
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,444
So you don't want to confess, huh?

726
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:22,090
Where do you think you are going?

727
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:25,493
Why don't you tell me the truth?

728
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:29,570
You love me.

729
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:35,639
I'm going to make you confess.

730
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,205
Still don't want to confess?

731
01:18:57,799 --> 01:18:58,891
Are you sure about this?

732
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:20,245
Hmm, you seem to attract a lot of men.

733
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:30,995
Ta, I saw your stepmom fooling
around with that coach O-Larn.

734
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,498
They're in the gym.

735
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:51,608
I want her to be brutally tortured!

736
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,230
You have to help me!

737
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:11,796
I don't know who else to turn to.

738
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:14,335
Listen well, Mrs. Panor.

739
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:20,644
There is only one way that you will
be able to win over this ordeal.

740
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:42,469
You must eat the flesh
of those that cursed you.

741
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:45,099
But it may make you insane.

742
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:50,173
Because all of his powers
will flow in your veins.

743
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:03,647
Can you remember anything now?

744
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,428
Don't be afraid.

745
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:21,304
No matter how dirty your past
is, I'll clean you up good.

746
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:36,782
I think, it is about time.

747
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:14,862
Please! Don't hurt me, teacher!

748
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,760
I'll confess! I'll confess everything!

749
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,133
I was the one that encouraged Ta and...

750
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:23,295
...his friends to tape you
and coach O-Larn together.

751
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:25,564
I was the one that put a curse on you.

752
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,643
I shouldn't have had
that affair with you!

753
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:37,113
I shouldn't have
thought of you that way.

754
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,178
Teacher let me go please!

755
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:50,129
Teacher, let me go please!

756
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:52,931
Por.

757
01:22:57,505 --> 01:23:00,099
Kim? Ta?

758
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:08,715
Is it true, Ta?

759
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:19,186
How could you?

760
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:26,192
Kim, help me please!
Kim, I made a mistake!

761
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:34,699
I thought that we would
love each other forever, Kim!

762
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:39,673
I never thought you could be
so cruel. I never thought...

763
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:45,219
Ta! Ta, don't leave me like this!

764
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:48,949
You can have her! Just
don't leave me here!

765
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,382
Let's get out of here, Ta.

766
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:54,251
Ta, you bastard, come back here!

767
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:57,991
Ta, come back!

768
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:01,532
Don't leave me.

769
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:30,160
I'm not going to let you
get away that easy, my dear.

770
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,095
Shoot it!

771
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:56,723
Teacher! Let me go!

772
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:05,091
Let me go!

773
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:08,402
Teacher, you let me go now!

774
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:15,233
Teacher, please let me go!

775
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:17,878
Let me go!

776
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:33,656
I'm begging you to let me go.

777
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:41,698
Teacher, please I'm
begging you to let me go!

778
01:25:42,036 --> 01:25:43,333
Let me go!

779
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,166
Let me go!

780
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:53,206
Please, let me go!

781
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,716
Teacher, please don't hurt me.

782
01:25:57,852 --> 01:25:59,285
Just let me go!

783
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:03,921
Teacher, I'm begging
for you to let me go.

784
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:13,427
You shall see my face clearly.

785
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:17,535
And then you will pay a
visit to the three eyed god.

786
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:20,697
However, I have to clean you up first...

787
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,342
Don't worry...

788
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:51,534
There, now you are at ease.

789
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:55,771
It is time to clean you
up from the inside out.

790
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:30,489
Ta! You go on ahead. I can't go on.

791
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:38,363
No Kim, I won't leave you!

792
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:56,042
Listen, you're not going
to do anything about it?

793
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:01,554
Fine, I'll do something about it!

794
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:12,431
Hello? Hello?

795
01:31:13,601 --> 01:31:15,694
Hello? Noot my dear?

796
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:19,630
Who's this?

797
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,379
I'm not going to let you die that easy!

798
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:29,711
I'm going to send you
to the three eyed god.

799
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:40,352
Wake up!

800
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:43,024
Wake up!

801
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:45,629
Wake up!

802
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:33,878
Now that you are clean enough, I will
now prepare you for his greatness.

803
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:40,248
Freeze! Miss, you better drop it!

804
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:47,292
Fire!

805
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:55,128
Please move away.

806
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:57,466
Move away from here!

807
01:32:58,372 --> 01:32:59,566
Give us room!

808
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,536
Please let us pass!

809
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:04,438
Kim, hang on.

810
01:33:09,016 --> 01:33:10,540
Kim, hang on.

811
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,066
On the path of life with many choices...

812
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:42,149
...sometimes we never know what
the outcome of our choices will be.

813
01:33:44,218 --> 01:33:47,745
But then again, many times we know
what we should or shouldn't do.

814
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:50,250
We just neglect to chose wisely.

815
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,457
However, you may be correct in
saying...

816
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:58,498
...sometimes if we had made the
right choices from the start...

817
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,495
...death wouldn't be so close.

818
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:10,572
Our lives, both mine and Ta's, were
spared...

819
01:34:10,678 --> 01:34:14,614
...so that we may know what our
purpose in life would ultimately be.

820
01:34:17,585 --> 01:34:19,883
Not for the future, or for the past.

821
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:21,477
But for the present.

822
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:27,954
We must choose the correct path
at all times for our own sake.

823
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:34,466
And I hope to see those
choices at all times.

824
01:34:34,935 --> 01:34:35,867
I'm better, Dad.

825
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:38,461
Rest up! Here I brought you some
treats.

826
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:40,205
Thank you mother.

827
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:11,360
Thank you for staying with me.

828
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:18,301
Ta, let's start all over again.

829
01:35:21,148 --> 01:35:22,342
Yes.

830
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:42,835
We are now at the crime
scene of the teacher, Panor.

831
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:46,671
Police have searched Mrs. Panor's
house.

832
01:35:46,807 --> 01:35:48,035
Kim...

833
01:35:49,376 --> 01:35:51,537
I have something I have to tell you.

834
01:35:54,115 --> 01:35:56,777
I lied to you about my
time at boarding school.

835
01:35:57,551 --> 01:35:59,382
I never stayed there.

836
01:36:02,156 --> 01:36:04,249
I never told you because...

837
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:07,417
...I didn't think you could understand.

838
01:36:07,862 --> 01:36:13,630
<i>And the last body to be</i>
<i>found in the river was...</i>

839
01:36:14,034 --> 01:36:17,231
<i>... Ta, her stepson.</i>

840
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:25,978
It's been a long time already, I
think you should just forget about it.

841
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:28,405
Thank you.

842
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:33,645
All right, I'll help
you sweep up the place.

843
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,198
Come back to me, please?

844
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:50,734
Listen, if you guys want to sweet talk
each other, do it outside of school time!

845
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:53,271
It's distracting.

846
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:04,348
I want to tell you what I've
discovered after you graduated.

847
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:17,828
I wanted you to see what I've seen.

848
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:20,823
To let others experience the
pain, as I've experienced it.

849
01:37:21,602 --> 01:37:23,661
She treated us badly, Kim.

850
01:37:23,871 --> 01:37:25,839
Everyone died a horrible death.

851
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:35,738
Grandma was locked up in the
closet, and was starved to death.

852
01:37:38,752 --> 01:37:45,658
As for me, even though it wasn't
my fault, I carried all the pain.

853
01:37:46,227 --> 01:37:49,094
Everyone should help me bear the pain.

854
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:54,367
Por should not be the one for you.

855
01:37:54,568 --> 01:37:56,695
Por wasn't meant for you, Kim.

856
01:38:12,152 --> 01:38:12,982
Kim!

857
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:14,919
Kim!

858
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:36,334
Kim, do you remember, you always
wanted me close. Didn't you?

859
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:39,571
Hey Kim, you see that guy?

860
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:43,078
He is star of the
school team. I like him.

861
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:48,679
Why tell me then? I
could steal him from you.

862
01:38:48,856 --> 01:38:54,590
Don't forget you're always
number two in this school.

863
01:38:57,298 --> 01:38:58,629
Want to bet?

864
01:38:58,732 --> 01:39:03,169
If in one week, he won't date me,
I'll always be second to you.

865
01:39:10,144 --> 01:39:13,875
Things like this, if
you try it, and do it...

866
01:39:14,748 --> 01:39:20,948
...it will be with you
'til the day you die!
