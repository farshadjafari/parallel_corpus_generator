Oh, you know me, I'm all about money.

905
01:29:13,845 --> 01:29:19,216
And you,
well, good knee, bad knee, no knee...

Heh, heh. Fuck cholesterol,
winning makes me hungry.

01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:08,927
Hell, I owed you.

916
01:30:09,099 --> 01:30:11,567
- You didn't owe me.
- Yeah, I did.

917
01:30:11,935 --> 01:30:15,769
Where I'm from, there ain't shit for free.

918
01:30:17,006 --> 01:30:20,171
And where I'm from,
everything was for free.

919
01:30:20,344 --> 01:30:22,608
And it was all shit.

920
01:30:24,381 --> 01:30:26,076
Any idea where you're gonna go, man?

921
01:30:30,051 --> 01:30:31,609

Heh.

You bring down the walls.

931
01:31:08,658 --> 01:31:10,284
It's a good name.

01:31:12,795 --> 01:31:14,261
Yeah.

01:31:34,149 --> 01:31:36,243
- Our fight?
- You bet your ass.

939
01:31:37,985 --> 01:31:40,386
