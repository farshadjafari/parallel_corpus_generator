1
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:39,896
<i>There was a time when the world was</i>
<i>plunging into darkness and chaos.</i>

2
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,174
<i>A time of witchcraft and sorcery.</i>

3
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,510
<i>A time when no-one stood against evil.</i>

4
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,628
Fire!

5
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,553
Yes?

6
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,983
Where is the throne room?

7
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,874
No?

8
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,819
Good lad. Good lad.

9
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,362
Now...

10
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,794
...let not one of these
putrid heathens live.

11
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,011
There's something in here with us.

12
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,750
No treasure is worth this.

13
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,224
Silence, you dogs.

14
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,256
Hold steady!

15
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,628
Captain, there's devilry here,
I knew it.

16
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,495
I said, "hold steady".

17
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,873
I am the only devil here!

18
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,209
Now...

19
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,879
...follow me!

20
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,367
Here it is, boys!

21
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:36,967
I've found it.

22
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,609
Malthus!

23
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,612
Solomon.

24
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,920
Solomon.

25
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,875
Killer.

26
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,457
Solomon.

27
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:45,190
What-- are you?

28
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,030
I am the Devil's Reaper.

29
00:07:56,008 --> 00:08:00,945
I am here to claim you,
Solomon Kane.

30
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:05,880
Your deal is done.

31
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,017
What deal?
I made no deal.

32
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,883
There was a deal...

33
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,725
...and your soul is the price.

34
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,288
Your life of murder...

35
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:22,393
...and greed is over.

36
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,169
You cannot take my soul.

37
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,674
Bow your head before me.

38
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,679
The Devil will have his due.

39
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,815
No!

40
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,190
You can tell your master
that I am not yet ready for Hell.

41
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,587
The Lord protects me.

42
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:57,695
Fool! He has abandoned you.

43
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,830
On your knees.

44
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,438
Never!
You'll never take my soul!

45
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,243
Take his soul.

46
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:11,540
Never!

47
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,246
You cannot escape us.

48
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,256
Your soul is damned!

49
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,148
Solomon?

50
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,568
Who's the novice?

51
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,397
This is Brother Thomas.

52
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,812
He joined us only a few days ago.

53
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,550
Those marks, do they--

54
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,279
--really protect you from Satan?

55
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,017
Mind what you name
in this holy place.

56
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,120
I would like to speak
with Solomon alone.

57
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,198
Once again we heard
your cries at matins.

58
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:39,797
My dreams.
My dreams do haunt me still.

59
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,932
You would do well to listen to
what your dreams tell you.

60
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,301
I do.

61
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,543
My dreams tell me only
that I am damned.

62
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,942
God protects His own.

63
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,415
I am not one of His own...

64
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,846
...am I?

65
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,521
My enemies are...

66
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,696
...are ever watchful of me.

67
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,160
But this place...

68
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:13,731
...this place and these prayers...

69
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,331
...symbols...

70
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,205
...they are all that hide me
from its gaze.

71
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,114
Solomon...

72
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,909
...these months you've been here...

73
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,745
...I've felt a shadow growing over us.

74
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,122
These are dark times.

75
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:38,959
I prayed for guidance--
and I was answered.

76
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,834
Solomon-- you must leave us.

77
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,671
Why? I...

78
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,710
...I live here in solitude.
I do no harm.

79
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,748
I've renounced my evil ways,
my power.

80
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,410
I'm learning...
learning to be a man of peace.

81
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,448
I know you are, but your future
is not here with us.

82
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,687
How could you do this to me?

83
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,060
I have given all my wealth to the Church.

84
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,763
We're grateful for your generosity,
but you must understand...

85
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,829
No. Father.

86
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:26,267
Do not-- do not make me beg.

87
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:32,441
This place is a--
is a sanctuary to me.

88
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,654
Where would you have me go?

89
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,284
You must go home.

90
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,923
Home?

91
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,155
You're of noble birth...

92
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,793
...you have lands in the west,
you must return to your inheritance.

93
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,064
Solomon...

94
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,029
No! I cannot return home.

95
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,243
Nor can you remain.

96
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,604
I was told in my dreams
he was to be sent from here.

97
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,631
I listen to what I'm told.

98
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,307
Does Kane know his purpose?

99
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,342
Every man must discover
his own destiny.

100
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:42,314
Kane must find his purpose.

101
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,055
There are many paths to redemption.

102
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,786
Not all of them peaceful.

103
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,073
Pilgrim!

104
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,177
Offer you a ride?

105
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,480
Thanks, friend, but no.

106
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,680
Well, the road ahead should
not be travelled alone.

107
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,882
Again, I'll thank you
for your offer.

108
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,015
I'll be walking.

109
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,447
As you wish.
God be with you.

110
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,847
And with you too, sir.

111
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:29,885
Ma'am.

112
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,322
- He'll hear us.
- I don't care.

113
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,692
Let him hear me.

114
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,169
Move and you die.

115
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,245
I don't want any trouble.

116
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,379
Well, that's too bad.
Because you've already got it!

117
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,085
Let's have a look.

118
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,087
Nothing worth stealing.

119
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,824
Nothing? You got nothing?

120
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,786
- Are you a priest?
- Just take what you want.

121
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,562
Oh, don't you worry,
pilgrim, we will.

122
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,757
Stay still.

123
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,035
Look at this.
These are magical symbols.

124
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,604
I say he's a sorcerer.

125
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,143
What shall we do with you, eh?

126
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,643
Shall we burn you as a witch?

127
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,781
Burn him! Burn him!

128
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,183
There's murder
in your eyes, traveller.

129
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,824
Would you kill me? Eh?

130
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,058
Huh? Would you?

131
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,097
No.

132
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,364
What?

133
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,072
You won't kill the man
who steals from you?!

134
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,946
I will not fight another man.

135
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,814
I have renounced violence.

136
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,953
Well, that's a shame
because we haven't.

137
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,448
You will do as I say, Solomon.

138
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:46,223
Don't forget your place.
You are the second son only.

139
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,062
Marcus is my heir.

140
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,597
He will be master of these
lands on my death.

141
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,033
But, Father,
Marcus is a brute and a bully!

142
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,633
You will take holy orders and
join the Church as I command.

143
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,803
But I do not want to be a priest.

144
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,338
What you want is of no importance.

145
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,373
Father Simnal is here to
take you to the abbey.

146
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,943
I won't go.

147
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,651
If you defy me,
you will have nothing.

148
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,894
I will cut you off.

149
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,195
You will be a landless vagrant.

150
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,330
Is that what you want?

151
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,776
Walk out now and
you may never return.

152
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,246
Do not defy me!

153
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,682
Be calm.

154
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,722
Be calm, sir.
Be calm, you are safe.

155
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,487
He's awake.
Father!

156
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,754
Father, that man, he's awake.

157
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:57,635
Here-- take a drink
of water if you can.

158
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:03,064
Careful. Careful.

159
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,163
Meredith.

160
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,768
His fever has broken, Father.

161
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,369
Thank the Lord, sir.

162
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,303
You will be well.
My name is Crowthorn.

163
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,612
William Crowthorn.

164
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:13,675
My daughter Meredith
has been tending you.

165
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,846
The good Lord must be
watching over you, sir.

166
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,981
He guided us to your rescue.

167
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,647
Edward, pull over.

168
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,492
We'll find a place to make
camp for the night.

169
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,027
Shall I put these down here, Mother?

170
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,798
Yes, thank you, Meredith.

171
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,195
Step lively, Meredith.

172
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,576
Samuel.

173
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,080
Water the horses.

174
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,008
Why me?

175
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,512
Your older brother
has given you a task.

176
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:53,217
See you set to it.

177
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,895
Master Kane.
You should be resting.

178
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,298
I can hardly repay
your hospitality.

179
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,502
...with idleness, Ma'am.

180
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:15,136
Give me a few moments to clean up,
I'll come and help you as I can.

181
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,286
You've regained your appetite,
Master Kane.

182
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,023
It's a fine meal,
Mistress Crowthorn.

183
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,952
My Katherine can make
anything taste good.

184
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,796
Leather boots and nettles last Sunday.

185
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,119
It certainly was not!

186
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,500
Tasted like it.

187
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,404
William tells us you were
Captain of a ship.

188
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,633
Yeah.

189
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,242
That I was.

190
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,970
Did you fight the Spanish?

191
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,106
I did.

192
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,746
Who else?

193
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,316
Seem to have fought
everyone at some time.

194
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:34,818
I've had many masters.

195
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,787
Once voyaged with Admiral Drake.

196
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,757
Admiral Drake!

197
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,629
That did not end well.

198
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,862
Must have been so exciting.

199
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,397
Seeing the world and
learning new things.

200
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,000
Why do you think
a life of violence

201
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,931
and bloodshed is
so admirable, Meredith?

202
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,276
You know that's not what I meant.

203
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,168
Why do you always argue with me?

204
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,513
Because you need to learn what to...

205
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:01,351
- I fought in the Queen's Army once.
- Yeah?

206
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,412
Before I found my faith.

207
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,619
Taking another man's life,

208
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,319
that's not an easy thing to do,
don't you agree?

209
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,929
I must confess, Mr Crowthorn...

210
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,968
...I was never more at home
than I was in battle.

211
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,034
Killing-- came easily to me.

212
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,020
<i>If you defy me,</i>
<i>you will have nothing.</i>

213
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,560
<i>Walk out now and</i>
<i>you may never return.</i>

214
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,255
<i>Do not defy me!</i>

215
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,402
Stop!

216
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,504
Please!

217
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,810
- Please, help me! No!
- Shut up!

218
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:03,872
Stop!

219
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,241
Marcus, what are you doing?

220
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,980
Solomon, I thought you'd run away.

221
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,510
Fleeing the life of a holy man.

222
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,318
- Solomon, he tried to...
- Quiet!

223
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,984
- I gave you no leave to speak!
- Sarah, run!

224
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,426
This is not your concern,
little brother.

225
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,724
Since you're going away,
here's something to remember me by.

226
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,560
Come here and look at this!

227
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,832
I am the first-born!

228
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:30,706
All this will be mine and
you'll have nothing!

229
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,337
Take your bags and leave this land.

230
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,678
Marcus!

231
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,981
Friend. Friend.

232
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,011
Please, sit down. Join me.

233
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:47,923
Thank you.

234
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,428
How are you feeling?

235
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,792
Aches, bruises. Nothing.

236
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,594
Your daughter has a healer's gift.

237
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,428
She does indeed.

238
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,396
Just like her mother.

239
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,538
Two most beautiful women
in this world, Master Kane.

240
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,912
My family is all and everything to me.

241
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,282
You are blessed.

242
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,219
Do you have kin?

243
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,947
I had a brother.

244
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,592
But that was a lifetime ago now.

245
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,692
We've lost loved ones.

246
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:29,131
To plague, persecution and bigotry.

247
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:34,700
Well, Edward, now.
He-- had a wife and child once.

248
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,368
But the Lord saw fit to embrace them.

249
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:45,107
So-- now you sail
for the New World, huh?

250
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,016
Yes, indeed, we do.

251
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,778
Sometimes...

252
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,182
...we all need to start again.

253
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,623
You might consider joining us.

254
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,855
Well, that's a--
that's a kind offer, William.

255
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,764
Thank you. Very kind.

256
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,733
I should be honest with you.

257
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:09,270
You should know the kind of man
you're thinking about taking in.

258
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,402
I've done bad things.

259
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,003
Terrible things.

260
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,174
Cruel things.

261
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,516
I am a...

262
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,751
No, I was...

263
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:27,958
...was an evil--

264
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:30,794
--evil man.

265
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,162
But the Lord speaks of redemption
and forgiveness.

266
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,635
No. My soul is damned.

267
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:44,232
Satan's creatures will take me
should I stray from the path of peace.

268
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,777
Then do not stray...

269
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,978
...Master Kane.

270
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,046
Do not stray.

271
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,080
Captain Kane?

272
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,645
Yes, Miss?

273
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,546
I made these clothes-- for you.

274
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,611
Your others are a little...

275
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,182
A little what, Miss?

276
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,624
A little...

277
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,226
...worn.

278
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,667
Thank you, Miss.

279
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,897
Thank you.

280
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,815
Now there stands a fine figure of a man.
Don't you think, William?

281
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,653
It's better than those rags
you were wearing, and that's a fact.

282
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:06,680
I'm glad you approve, Ma'am.

283
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,782
Finally, you're respectable.

284
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:13,027
Been a long time since anybody said
that about me.

285
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,393
Thank you.

286
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,943
Are you coming to America with us?

287
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,878
I'm not so sure, Samuel.

288
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:31,974
Why?

289
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,244
Well...

290
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,254
...you and your family are
beginning a new life.

291
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,551
Whereas I need to undo an old one.

292
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,025
Those men who hurt you,

293
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,591
you could have killed them
if you wanted, couldn't you?

294
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:46,495
There was a time when I...

295
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:51,467
...would have ripped their
still-beating hearts from their chests.

296
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,173
Would you fight me?

297
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,368
I will if you continue
with your infernal questioning.

298
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,365
Fight me.

299
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,973
I have no reason to fight you,
young man.

300
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,905
- Samuel, stop it!
- Now you have a reason!

301
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:07,737
To save this beautiful maiden from me.

302
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:09,549
Samuel! Don't scare the horses.

303
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:11,989
Solomon. Save me. Help!

304
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,250
Come, sir.

305
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:14,721
Come on.

306
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,592
Samuel...

307
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,428
...get back to the cart. Go on.

308
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,202
Who could have done this?

309
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,438
The Devil.

310
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,975
The Devil was here.

311
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,517
No, there was no Devil.

312
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,893
There was a witch burning here.

313
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,455
The creature must have broken free.

314
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,991
...taken vengeance, my Lord.
Show thyself.

315
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,032
We should leave.

316
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,907
We can't just leave
these people for carrion.

317
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,426
Keep her well stoked, Edward.

318
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,004
We got to keep the shadows
at bay tonight.

319
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,841
Child-- can you tell us what happened?

320
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,903
Oh, let the poor girl be, William.

321
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,137
They tried to burn a witch.

322
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,452
People came to watch her die, but...

323
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:27,085
...the flames, they didn't hurt her.

324
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:31,562
She just laughed and--
she said...

325
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,126
...she said--
that all the Devil's children...

326
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:38,527
...were free to walk the earth now.

327
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,863
And then...

328
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,205
...she killed them all.

329
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,937
She burnt out their eyes...

330
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,514
...because they came to watch.

331
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,743
We should pray.

332
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:58,915
I'm tired.

333
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,914
Just a moment more.

334
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,477
For our prayers.

335
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,324
I don't want to pray.

336
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,194
It's all right, it's all right.

337
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,894
I'm so tired. Please?

338
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,963
Of course you are.
You poor thing.

339
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,834
Let's find a place for you to sleep.

340
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:20,642
Edward, I think the child
should wear your cross tonight.

341
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,167
For protection.

342
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,341
Of course.

343
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:26,671
Here.

344
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:27,878
Thank you.

345
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,978
Here, child.

346
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,927
Wear this tonight.

347
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,390
It will keep you safe.

348
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:40,990
Solomon...

349
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,595
It's you we want.

350
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:52,573
What did you do?

351
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,768
Here, child.

352
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,412
Her, this is the witch!

353
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,552
The Devil is waiting for you, Kane!

354
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,782
Bring them.

355
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,231
Get off me!

356
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,897
More recruits for Malachi, my Lord.

357
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,182
Are you ready to
serve your Overlord?

358
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,618
Better than the alternative.

359
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:13,359
To serve us you have to join us.

360
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,620
Well...

361
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,486
...just tell us what to do.

362
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,870
What are you doing?!

363
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,628
It's good.

364
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,177
Father, I have the firewood.

365
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,345
Well done, Samuel.
Break it up now.

366
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,919
Let me help you with that.
Give it a pull.

367
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,850
- There we are.
- Thank you.

368
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,952
Here-- let me see.

369
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,679
Does that hurt?

370
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:26,288
No. I can't feel anything.

371
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:30,499
Why did that creature mark me?

372
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,803
I don't know.

373
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,863
Evil has its own reasons.

374
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,069
Are we safe?

375
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,303
Don't you worry.

376
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,213
There is no evil in you, Meredith.

377
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,208
Trust me.

378
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,286
I trust you.

379
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,319
Come along with that wood, Samuel.

380
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,521
Bigger pieces than that, please.
Bigger pieces. We want hot soup.

381
00:34:56,693 --> 00:34:57,751
William.

382
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,462
You might wanna set a
smaller fire tonight.

383
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,393
Don't wanna attract
any unwanted attention.

384
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,565
Solomon!

385
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:42,322
What's the matter?

386
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,137
- I heard something.
- Where?

387
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,470
Over there.

388
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,898
Beyond those trees.

389
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:47,900
Wait here.

390
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,990
Samuel, Samuel, keep down!

391
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,394
Keep down, keep quiet!

392
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,888
Who are they?

393
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,461
Solomon-- what are they?

394
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,095
I want you to go back to your father.

395
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,233
Tell him to move out immediately.

396
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,404
Go!

397
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,291
Leave her!

398
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,733
Meredith!

399
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,336
Mother!

400
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,549
Solomon! Solomon!

401
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,246
Samuel!

402
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,340
Solomon!

403
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,006
This is the one.

404
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,306
No! Stop! Stop!

405
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,908
Solomon! Help us!

406
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,618
- No!
- Samuel!

407
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:48,156
No, leave him be.

408
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,632
Leave him be.
Don't you hurt him.

409
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,467
I am unarmed.

410
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,601
Solomon, help him!

411
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,106
- Solomon, kill them!
- Silence, Samuel!

412
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,367
Kill them all!

413
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,315
Listen to him, Samuel. Listen.

414
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,111
Don't struggle, lad.

415
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,617
If you don't struggle,
he'll let you go.

416
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,811
Won't you?

417
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:14,421
Kill him. You know you can.

418
00:38:14,424 --> 00:38:17,120
Just be quiet, Samuel!

419
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,722
You.

420
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,056
Are you their master?

421
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:25,433
What is it you want?!
I'll do anything.

422
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,086
Kill me.

423
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:45,554
Can you?

424
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,859
No, I...I cannot.

425
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,623
I am--

426
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,930
--a man of peace.

427
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,462
Don't you hurt that boy.

428
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,935
This boy...

429
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,676
...this child has more heart
than any of you.

430
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,497
Help me.

431
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,106
He is the only man here.

432
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,376
- No, listen to me.
- Solomon, stop him!

433
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,017
No!

434
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,186
Samuel!

435
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,857
My son!

436
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,134
Take the marked one.

437
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,568
Solomon-- do something!

438
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:41,378
Help us! Kill them!
Kill them all!

439
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,609
Solomon, please help us!

440
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,515
What is it you want from me?

441
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,813
What is it?

442
00:39:56,293 --> 00:40:00,195
Is this-- all I am to you?

443
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,129
Then so be it.

444
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,671
If I kill you...

445
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,269
...I am bound for Hell.

446
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:22,151
It is a price-- I shall gladly pay.

447
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,962
Meredith!

448
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:40,830
Leave her!

449
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:45,301
No! William!

450
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,021
Get off her!

451
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,495
Meredith!

452
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:47,762
Meredith!

453
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,219
Go, go!

454
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,859
- Solomon.
- Yeah.

455
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,417
Get her back.

456
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:49,990
Oh, I will.

457
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:54,465
Get her back. Swear on oath...

458
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,502
...to get her back-- for me.

459
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,434
These are my last words on earth.

460
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,473
I know God in Heaven hears.

461
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:07,606
If you save our child...

462
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:12,047
...your soul, too, will be saved.

463
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:15,556
You can redeem yourself, Solomon.

464
00:43:15,558 --> 00:43:18,049
I know this to be true.

465
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,161
Swear it to me.

466
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:22,993
Swear.

467
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,467
I swear.

468
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:27,435
I swear it, William.
I will find her.

469
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,069
Find her.

470
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,432
Go.

471
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:41,896
Get him!

472
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:36,219
Meredith, are you in there?

473
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:39,656
Have you seen this girl?

474
00:46:39,662 --> 00:46:42,495
No, no. Look at it, please.
Have you seen this girl?

475
00:46:42,498 --> 00:46:44,022
I don't know her, sir. Please...

476
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,468
Where are they taking you?
Have you seen this girl?

477
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,802
I don't know.

478
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,598
There are raiders everywhere.
Please!

479
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:52,701
No, look at this!
Have you seen this girl?!

480
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:56,475
Please don't hurt me.
I just wanna go home.

481
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:01,877
Forgive me, child.
Forgive me.

482
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,018
Go, go. Go in peace.

483
00:47:15,698 --> 00:47:16,960
Move along.

484
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,479
- Clear out the dead.
- They're no use to Malachi.

485
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,950
Where are you taking us?
What do you want?

486
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,421
Make your peace, child.
There's no way out for us.

487
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:42,654
Slavery or death.
That's our only way out.

488
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,853
God will not deliver us from this.

489
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,352
We'll find a way out.

490
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:49,829
Take my hand.
We'll find the strength to survive this.

491
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,095
Quiet!

492
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:53,101
Bring her here.

493
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,007
Dear God.

494
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,476
Dear God...

495
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:26,485
...I beg you to listen to me now.

496
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,952
I have failed you.
I cannot find her.

497
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,753
I am lost...

498
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:39,461
...and I need your light--
to help me find my way.

499
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,704
Forgive me, Father.

500
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:46,935
Such times we live in.

501
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,311
I wished only for some refuge
and a moment of prayer.

502
00:50:54,917 --> 00:50:57,317
Praise God in His sanctuary.

503
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:01,579
Praise Him in the firmament
of His power.

504
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:11,966
I've seen such terrible things.

505
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,830
So this is your home?

506
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,565
I need nowhere else.

507
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,641
I have nowhere else.

508
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,209
You come far?

509
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,817
Three days' hard ride
have brought me here.

510
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:34,553
But where 'here' is I know not.

511
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:38,659
These are the borderlands of
Somerset and Devonshire.

512
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,886
My home, too.

513
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,024
Sad homecoming for you, then.

514
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,126
Have those Raiders been here?

515
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,969
Those black-eyed lapdogs of Malachi?

516
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,098
Aye...

517
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,603
...they passed through here.

518
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:58,012
Now they hold sway over
all the lands to the west of here.

519
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:02,075
Then I shall be riding westward.

520
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,117
Then you shall ride to your death,
my son.

521
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:07,851
Who is this Malachi?

522
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:10,190
A servant of the Devil.

523
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,258
A sorcerer.
No-one ever sees him.

524
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,855
He hides away in his castle...

525
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,665
...and sends forth that
masked warrior to do his bidding.

526
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:21,124
His army make slaves of the weak...

527
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,163
...and soldiers of the strong.

528
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,874
But God will save the faithful.

529
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,174
It's here...

530
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:36,281
...it's here, here.

531
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:38,682
I have read it.

532
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,025
I have read it.

533
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,256
This is the end of days.

534
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:54,563
You truly believe that?

535
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,068
Every foul thing that the light
of Christ kept at bay...

536
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:01,635
...is crawling up out of the pit
to curse the land.

537
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,316
I think Christ and all his angels
have been asleep...

538
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,080
...whilst we are left to suffer.

539
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:11,349
You mind your blasphemy!

540
00:53:12,588 --> 00:53:15,648
It can only be as God ordains it.

541
00:53:15,724 --> 00:53:17,783
How can it be right...

542
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:22,029
...that this evil is left to walk the earth...

543
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,392
...whilst all we have to
protect ourselves is what?

544
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,365
Simple faith?

545
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,769
It is written in the scriptures.

546
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,506
What was that?

547
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,815
I heard something outside.

548
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,717
No, my son.

549
00:53:49,558 --> 00:53:51,753
There is nothing evil out there.

550
00:53:55,698 --> 00:53:57,529
Evil is already here.

551
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,126
What do you mean?

552
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:03,764
Come.

553
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:18,680
See?

554
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,620
"Satan has desired to have them...

555
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:31,160
...that he may sift them as wheat."

556
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,122
My God...

557
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,052
What was I to do?

558
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,721
You should destroy them, man!

559
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,124
I cannot destroy them.
They were men and women once.

560
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,523
People I knew.

561
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:10,165
Malachi's curse that
changed them is no fault of theirs.

562
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:15,070
This is my flock.
I keep them.

563
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:17,713
Care for them.

564
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:22,711
I feed them.

565
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:24,214
Feed them?

566
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,546
With what?

567
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,782
What do you feed them?

568
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:30,825
Flesh!

569
00:55:33,562 --> 00:55:37,726
I deliver you unto Satan's creatures
for the destruction of your flesh...

570
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,225
...that your spirit may be saved.

571
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:43,038
May God have mercy on your soul.

572
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,441
Friend of yours?

573
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,261
I remember this one, lads.

574
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:51,162
He's not a fighter. Remember?

575
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:54,231
What are you doing here, Puritan?

576
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:58,469
So-- you've given yourselves
over to this evil, have you?

577
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,169
You should try it.

578
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:04,904
Malachi will own all this land
here soon enough.

579
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:07,741
There's no point in you fighting.

580
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,911
The only thing round here is fighting.

581
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:12,077
But you don't do that...

582
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:14,554
...do you?

583
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,289
Well, you know...

584
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:21,158
...I may just have
changed my mind about that.

585
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,459
No! No! What are you doing?!

586
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,334
What are they?!

587
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,798
Now, this girl, your kind took her.

588
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:09,533
Have you seen her?

589
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,911
I don't know her.

590
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,615
Take a long hard look.

591
00:59:14,618 --> 00:59:19,351
This is your last chance to save
your pitiful life.

592
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:22,153
- Come on!
- All right, I've seen her.

593
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:24,350
Where?
Where have you seen her?

594
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,850
She's dead.

595
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,864
Dead?

596
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,094
Don't you lie to me.

597
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,536
No!

598
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:38,671
I wouldn't lie. I want to live!

599
00:59:38,776 --> 00:59:41,973
Don't you lie to me!

600
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,705
I'm not. She's dead!
Dead!

601
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:46,247
She's not dead!

602
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,188
For the bag. Leave it all.

603
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,387
Thank you, sir.

604
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,135
Are you sure?

605
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,805
It is him. I knew it.

606
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,517
Sir?

607
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:35,280
Captain Kane?

608
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:39,323
I'm Henry Telford.
Do you remember me?

609
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,487
Captain Kane?

610
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:47,695
I was a mate on the Tiercel
when you captained.

611
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,569
My name's Telford.
Do you remember?

612
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:52,470
- It's not him.
- It is him! It's Kane.

613
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,798
He can lead us, believe me.

614
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:58,610
Where to, Henry?
Another tavern? Look at him!

615
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:04,878
My friend here says you're the
greatest warrior he ever saw.

616
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:08,780
- I don't believe him.
- You shouldn't.

617
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,092
I know what you can do, Captain.
I've seen it!

618
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,822
Those were distant times.

619
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,697
She's dead now.

620
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:25,768
And I have...

621
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:28,973
...forfeit my soul.

622
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,086
- He's no use to us. Leave him!
- No!

623
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,651
Captain Kane, we need a leader.

624
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:47,719
- We have to fight back!
- Then fight back!

625
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,326
She's lost.

626
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,130
And I lost her.

627
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,810
And I-- I have to pay.

628
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,507
Let them come and get me.

629
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,643
I care not.

630
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,162
Mercy!

631
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,470
Mercy, please!

632
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:13,647
This is the fate of those
who defy Malachi.

633
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,269
Please have mercy!

634
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,947
There will be no mercy!

635
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:35,526
This man cannot save you!

636
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,795
He is nothing!

637
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,792
Crucify him!

638
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:42,665
And burn the town to the ground!

639
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,361
No, no, no!

640
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:58,637
Solomon!

641
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,573
Solomon!

642
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:03,311
God help him!

643
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:13,653
Solomon! Solomon, please!

644
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,846
- Meredith.
- Can you hear me?

645
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,384
Meredith!

646
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,427
Meredith!

647
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,768
God-- save me!

648
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:23,784
Captain Kane.

649
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:38,634
...another 20 at Romney Marsh.
He's getting stronger all the time.

650
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,337
That's why we need Kane.

651
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:48,116
We need him
whatever his past sins were.

652
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,447
But one devil for another
seems like folly.

653
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:57,762
...Earth, fire, stone, and water...

654
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,321
Keep your filthy pagan magic
away from me.

655
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,493
It is my pagan magic
that has healed you.

656
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:07,731
There's more power here
than your Christian God.

657
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:10,268
You'd do well to remember that.

658
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,708
I have done what you asked.

659
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:26,716
His body is healed.

660
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,121
What do you see of our future?

661
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:34,997
Your champion will lead you
into blood and darkness.

662
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:36,624
Are you ready for that?

663
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:06,380
What are you doing?
You need to rest.

664
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,581
- I'm leaving.
- Why?

665
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:12,123
Because it's not over yet.
She's still alive.

666
01:12:12,827 --> 01:12:14,419
You're barely healed.

667
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,694
And we're too few to
fight Malachi's men.

668
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,065
Just wait a little.

669
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:23,832
I do not ask you to come with me
nor do I want you to.

670
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,638
Well, you may not want it but we will.

671
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,843
This lad has promised us you will
destroy this evil...

672
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:32,208
...and we're here to fight with you.

673
01:12:37,618 --> 01:12:39,518
Promised, have you?

674
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,617
That's what you want, isn't it?
To end this?

675
01:12:47,497 --> 01:12:49,089
Then let us help you.

676
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:52,927
Malachi was a priest and a healer...

677
01:12:53,434 --> 01:12:57,029
...but he sold his soul to the Devil
for the power he now possesses.

678
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:00,735
He enslaves our people
and corrupts the land.

679
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:03,644
And the masked rider...

680
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,381
...he's the iron fist that commands
his army and spreads the poison.

681
01:13:08,752 --> 01:13:11,220
He has no face beneath his mask.

682
01:13:11,486 --> 01:13:13,545
He can possess you with his touch.

683
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,385
It's true, I've seen it.

684
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:21,623
If we kill him,
Malachi will be vulnerable.

685
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:23,788
Easier said than done, my friend.

686
01:13:23,798 --> 01:13:24,924
No.

687
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:27,429
He will fall.

688
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,462
You know where this Malachi is?

689
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:30,699
That is no secret.

690
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:32,139
Axmouth Castle.

691
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:36,073
No-- No, that cannot be.

692
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:40,246
There is no doubt.
Do you know it?

693
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:43,483
My father was lord of Axmouth Castle.

694
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:45,410
I grew up there.

695
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:48,180
There's no lord there now.

696
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:53,457
I did not even know he'd died.

697
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:56,829
Now-- this must end.

698
01:13:57,732 --> 01:14:00,758
All of you... all of you,
gather your weapons!

699
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,068
- We're not ready.
- It's time to take the fight to him.

700
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:05,096
- We're not ready.
- Neither is he!

701
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,439
- We're too few.
- Oh, come on!

702
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:10,037
You have seen me taking
cities with fewer.

703
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:12,172
But how do we get through
the front gates?

704
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:16,310
You forget, I was born here.

705
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,285
I have no intention of
going through the front gates.

706
01:15:49,012 --> 01:15:51,537
Good God. My home!

707
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,413
You lived here?

708
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:56,106
That explains a lot.

709
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,065
You!

710
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:19,902
Welcome home--

711
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,005
Solomon Kane.

712
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:24,002
Telford! Get your men inside!
We cannot win this!

713
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,564
Men!

714
01:17:28,576 --> 01:17:29,736
Follow me!

715
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:39,272
Meredith?

716
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:44,109
- Help us!
- Meredith?

717
01:18:44,452 --> 01:18:46,249
Is there a girl in there called Meredith?

718
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:47,881
- Please help us...
- Meredith?

719
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:05,598
You're free. All of you.
Get out.

720
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,371
Let's get away from here.

721
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:36,070
Come on, old man, you're free.

722
01:19:38,508 --> 01:19:39,975
All right, I'll help you, then.

723
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,645
Let's see if I can
loosen these chains.

724
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:48,308
Even if you do, I'll stay.

725
01:19:48,684 --> 01:19:50,675
What are you talking about, man?
Why?

726
01:19:50,686 --> 01:19:53,018
Because this was my home.

727
01:19:59,794 --> 01:20:01,056
Father?

728
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:05,926
Solomon?

729
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:19,939
I thought I had lost you forever.

730
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,844
You were still a boy when...

731
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:32,659
You will never break them.
They were spun with dark magic...

732
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:35,022
...as much as with metal.

733
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:42,095
How will I free you?

734
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:44,401
You can't, Solomon, don't try now.

735
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,171
My Father...

736
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:52,603
...I have carried such...

737
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,912
...such guilt for what I did.

738
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:58,485
I did not mean for Marcus to fall.

739
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,981
I did not mean for him to die.

740
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:04,553
He did not die, Solomon.

741
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:10,120
If he had, this nightmare
would never have begun.

742
01:21:10,364 --> 01:21:11,922
He did not...?

743
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,792
Thank God he is alive.

744
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:18,102
It was not through God's will
that he survived.

745
01:21:19,406 --> 01:21:20,862
Well, what do you mean?

746
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,343
Well...

747
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:27,104
...he was terribly injured
by the all but he didn't die.

748
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:29,636
But nor did he wake.

749
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:32,847
No surgeons or priests could help, so...

750
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:39,149
...I brought the sorcerer here.

751
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,718
- You?
- Yeah.

752
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:43,530
You brought Malachi here?

753
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:46,795
I offered him everything I had.

754
01:21:47,668 --> 01:21:51,001
Just to bring Marcus back to me.
Everything.

755
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:56,333
And he succeeded, Solomon.

756
01:21:56,646 --> 01:21:59,069
With his mirrors and magic...

757
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,982
...he reached into the darkness
and brought Marcus back. But...

758
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:05,846
...he was changed.

759
01:22:07,454 --> 01:22:11,413
And his face,
so damaged by the fall...

760
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,995
...he hid behind a mask...

761
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,926
...and obeyed only the will of the sorcerer.

762
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:21,865
No, he cannot be my brother.

763
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:24,600
That creature is your brother.

764
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,503
Or what remains.

765
01:22:26,742 --> 01:22:31,111
And now Marcus infects
those who follow him.

766
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,640
One thing you must do for me.

767
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:39,220
Father, just ask and it shall be done.

768
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:53,367
We both have our sins to answer for.

769
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:56,696
And I'm ready to answer for mine...

770
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:58,400
...now.

771
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:00,640
No.

772
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:02,266
You have to.

773
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:05,611
Because I brought the sorcerer here.

774
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:09,745
And as long as I'm alive he will remain.

775
01:23:11,952 --> 01:23:14,284
He will never let me die.

776
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:40,278
Bring it here.

777
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:45,243
Kane!

778
01:23:45,586 --> 01:23:46,883
Through here!

779
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:48,543
Kane, for God's sake, help us!

780
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:50,387
Is this it?
Is this all you have left?

781
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:53,452
Fletcher, McNess, Hawkstone, maybe.
The rest I don't know.

782
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,984
Just keep them back.

783
01:23:55,562 --> 01:23:56,881
You hold steady now.

784
01:23:56,897 --> 01:23:58,626
This is your folly.

785
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:02,027
Just a few more moments.

786
01:24:02,738 --> 01:24:05,332
I think I can stop this
with a single blow.

787
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:25,754
Malachi?

788
01:24:27,694 --> 01:24:29,719
Malachi!

789
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:34,264
I'm here for you.
Isn't this what you want?

790
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:00,556
Come on.

791
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,129
Solomon!

792
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:38,893
Solomon, no, it's a trap!

793
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:49,134
Long is the road that the pilgrim walks
in the name of his devotion.

794
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:56,978
Yet longer still is the journey home
to the land of his fathers.

795
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,819
I've been waiting for you.

796
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:11,656
You are unfit to sit upon
my father's hair.

797
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,361
Your father was a child.

798
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:16,667
A pathetic fool
who made a pact with the Devil.

799
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:20,740
He betrayed you.
Your soul is damned.

800
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:22,575
Get up!

801
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:27,378
Are you still the good, loyal son?

802
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:43,158
Malachi?

803
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:46,498
Malachi!

804
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:49,133
Malachi, you coward!

805
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,640
Meredith, are you all right?

806
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:56,703
You came for me.

807
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:58,236
I swore I would.

808
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:00,603
Solomon, no, it's a trap!

809
01:27:00,616 --> 01:27:02,516
They only marked me so that
you would come.

810
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:04,650
No, stop!

811
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,973
The Devil wants you.

812
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:09,286
The Devil can take me soon enough.

813
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:24,932
Oh God, Solomon!

814
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:31,640
Brother, listen to me.

815
01:27:32,446 --> 01:27:36,007
If you can hear me, Marcus,
you do not have to do this.

816
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:36,881
No!

817
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,744
Listen to me!

818
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:52,563
Meredith, run!

819
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:10,947
Where is your master?
Where is he?

820
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:14,445
Where are you, Malachi?
Hiding in the shadows?

821
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:18,324
Why should I hide from you?
I want you here.

822
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:21,552
Every step you took
led you to here.

823
01:28:21,662 --> 01:28:24,756
Every pain you suffered was
punishment for your sins.

824
01:28:24,965 --> 01:28:27,593
My master will have your soul!

825
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:32,035
See what the Devil
has sent to claim you.

826
01:28:32,374 --> 01:28:35,707
This beast will not fail to drag you
back to Hell.

827
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,643
Your soul is damned!

828
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,604
Oh, dear God!

829
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:46,219
Marcus...

830
01:28:47,988 --> 01:28:49,785
...our father is dead.

831
01:28:50,092 --> 01:28:52,219
You are lord here now!

832
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,090
Malachi has no control over you!

833
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:03,868
No!

834
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:25,423
Brother, stop! Brother!

835
01:29:41,842 --> 01:29:43,173
Solomon!

836
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:03,892
Rest in peace, brother.

837
01:30:05,834 --> 01:30:09,497
It's time. Only your
innocent blood will release him.

838
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:20,242
Now you are free!

839
01:30:42,704 --> 01:30:44,296
Get him!

840
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:54,136
My God.
Only you can help me now.

841
01:31:34,288 --> 01:31:35,414
Stop!

842
01:31:35,922 --> 01:31:37,184
Let her go.

843
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,819
You can have my soul.

844
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:45,557
Why would you risk everything,
even our soul...

845
01:31:47,734 --> 01:31:49,599
...to save her?

846
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:52,364
I made a promise.

847
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,007
I must keep it.

848
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:57,935
Solomon.

849
01:33:10,484 --> 01:33:12,179
Oh, thank God.

850
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:16,790
Oh, thank God.

851
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:21,318
It's gone.

852
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,495
Your father told me...

853
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:28,224
...that if I saved you...

854
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:31,268
...my soul will be redeemed.

855
01:33:32,973 --> 01:33:34,565
I have.

856
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:38,002
And it is.

857
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:42,373
And the Devil's claim on me
is no more.

858
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:51,724
The guards have fallen.

859
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,021
<i>Father...</i>

860
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:27,458
<i>...I have kept my promise and</i>
<i>Meredith is returned to her mother.</i>

861
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:30,060
<i>The demon is gone.</i>

862
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:34,463
<i>Banished to the shadows along</i>
<i>with the sorcerer who had cursed us all.</i>

863
01:34:35,602 --> 01:34:38,833
<i>But evil is not so easily defeated...</i>

864
01:34:38,974 --> 01:34:41,670
<i>...and I know I will have to fight again.</i>

865
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,110
<i>I am a very different man now.</i>

866
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:47,709
<i>through all of my travels,</i>

867
01:34:47,714 --> 01:34:50,979
<i>all the things I've seen and all I've done...</i>

868
01:34:51,318 --> 01:34:53,445
<i>...I have found my purpose.</i>

869
01:34:54,656 --> 01:34:58,285
<i>There was a time when the world was</i>
<i>plunging into darkness.</i>

870
01:34:58,392 --> 01:35:03,261
<i>A time of witchcraft and sorcery,</i>
<i>when no-one stood against evil.</i>

871
01:35:04,298 --> 01:35:05,595
<i>That time...</i>

872
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:08,426
<i>...is over.</i>
