My Fair Lady (1964)

3
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:58,465
MRS. EYNSFORD-HILL:
Freddy, go and find a cab.

4
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,759
Do you want me to catch pneumonia?

5
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:15,190
Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.

6
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,526
All right, I'll get one.

7
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,753
Look where you're goin', dear.
Look where you're goin'!

8
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,130
I'm so sorry.

9
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,176
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
A full day's wages.

10
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,305
MRS. EYNSFORD-HILL:
Freddy, go and find a cab.

11
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,556
Yes, Mother.

12
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,643
He's your son, is he?

13
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,021
If you'd done your duty
as a mother should...

14
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:58,066
...you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girl's
flow'rs and run away without payin'.

15
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,068
Go about your business, my girl.

16
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,946
And you wouldn't go off
without payin', either.

17
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,116
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.

18
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,705
Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?

19
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,416
I'm afraid not. It's worse than before.

20
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,877
If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.

21
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,755
Cheer up, Capt'n,
buy a flow'r off a poor girl.

22
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,256
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.

23
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,967
I can change 'alf a crown.
Take this for tuppence.

24
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,553
I told you, I'm awfully sorry.
Wait a minute.

25
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,848
Oh, yes. Here's three ha' pence,
if that's any use to you.

26
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,308
Thank you, sir.

27
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,610
You be careful.
Better give 'im a flower for it.

28
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,654
There's a bloke here behind that pillar...

29
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,573
...takin' down every blessed word
you're sayin'.

30
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,746
I ain't done nothin' wrong
by speakin' to the gentleman.

31
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,582
I've a right to sell flow'rs
if I keep off the curb.

32
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,918
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.

33
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,505
I never spoke to him except to ask him
to buy a flow'r off me.

34
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,132
- What's the bloomin' noise?
- A tec's takin' her down.

35
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,051
I'm makin' an honest livin'.

36
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,470
Who's doing all that shouting?

37
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,891
Sir, don't let 'im charge me.
You dunno what it means to me.

38
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:15,978
They'll take away me character
and drive me on the streets...

39
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,729
...for speakin' to gentlemen.

40
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:21,692
There, there. Who's hurting you,
you silly girl? What'd you take me for?

41
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,610
On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word.

42
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,612
Shut up! Do I look like a policeman?

43
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:29,032
Why'd ya take down me words?
'Ow do I know you took me down right?

44
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,618
You just show me
what you wrote ab'ut me.

45
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,628
That ain't proper writin'. I can't read it.

46
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,671
I can.

47
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,091
"I say, Capt'n,
now buy a flow'r off a poor girl. "

48
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,598
Oh, it's cause I called him "Capt'n. "

49
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:57,436
I meant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay
a charge against me for a word like that.

50
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,939
I'll make no charge.
Really, sir, if you are a detective...

51
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,151
...you needn't protect me
against molestation from young women...

52
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,152
...until I ask you.

53
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,613
Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.

54
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,782
He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman.
Look at his boots.

55
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,868
How are all your people down at Selsey?

56
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,454
Who told you my people
come from Selsey?

57
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,080
Never mind, they do.

58
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,627
How do you come to be up so far east?
You were born in Lisson Grove.

59
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,714
What 'arm is there
in my leavin' Lisson Grove?

60
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,301
It weren't fit for pigs to live.
I had to pay four and six a week.

61
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,136
Live where you like but stop that noise!

62
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,765
Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.

63
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,725
I'm a good girl, I am.

64
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,686
- Where do I come from?
- Hawkestone.

65
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,523
Who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.

66
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,776
You, sir, do you think
you could find me a taxi?

67
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,945
Madam, it's stopped raining.

68
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,531
You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court.

69
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,366
Isn't that where you live?

70
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,159
What impertinence!

71
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,163
Tell 'im where he comes from,
if you wanta go fortune-telling.

72
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,167
Cheltenham, Harrow...

73
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,004
...Cambridge and...

74
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,216
...India?

75
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,509
Quite right.

76
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,178
He ain't a tec,
he's a bloomin' busybody.

77
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:16,098
Do you do this sort of thing
for a living at a music hall?

78
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,308
I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.

79
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,728
He's no gentleman, he ain't,
to interfere with a poor girl!

80
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,522
How do you do it, may I ask?

81
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:28,485
Simple phonetics. The science of speech.
That's my profession. Also my hobby.

82
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,030
Anyone can spot an Irishman
or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...

83
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,241
...but I can place a man within six miles.

84
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:38,203
I can place 'im within two miles in London.
Sometimes within two streets.

85
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,081
Ought to be ashamed of 'imself,
unmanly coward.

86
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,041
- Is there a living in that?
- Oh, yes.

87
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,795
Let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl alone.

88
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,548
Cease this detestable
boohooing instantly...

89
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,509
...or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship!

90
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,180
I have a right to be here if I like,
same as you!

91
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,224
A woman who utters such disgusting,
depressing noises...

92
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,852
...has no right to be anywhere,
no right to live.

93
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,729
Remember, you're a human with a soul...

94
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,481
...and the divine gift of articulate speech.

95
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,651
Your native language is the language
of Shakespeare and...

96
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:13,697
...Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there
crooning like a bilious pigeon.

97
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,615
Aoow!

98
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,036
"Look at her,

00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,464
Aoow!

103
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,008
Heavens, what a sound!

104
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,344
"This is what the British population

105

a poor example.

as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

Indian dialects have always fascinated me.

167
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,758
Buy a flower. I'm short for me lodgin'.

168
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:02,801
Liar!

169
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,262
You said you could change half a crown.

170
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,682
You ought to be stuffed
with nails, you ought!

171
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:12,436
Here, take the whole bloomin' basket
for a sixpence!

172
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,399
A reminder.

173
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,739
How many are there actually?
PICKERING: How many what?

174
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,240
Indian dialects?

175
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,868
PICKERING: No fewer than
147 distinct languages...

176
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,828
...are recorded as vernacular in India.

177
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:43,425
Shouldn't we stand up, gentlemen?
We've got a bloomin' heiress in our midst.

178
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,802
Would you be lookin'
for a good butler, Eliza?

179
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,346

Home? What do you want to go 'ome for?

231
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,983
It's nearly 5:00.
My daughter Eliza'll be along soon.

232
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,403
She ought to be good for 'alf a crown
for a father that loves 'er.

233
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:57,322
That's a laugh.
You ain't been near 'er for months.

234
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:01,201
What's that got to do with it?
What's 'alf a crown after all I've give 'er?

235
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,328
When did you ever give 'er anythin'?

236
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,581
Anythin'? I give 'er everythin'.

237
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:09,459
I give 'er the greatest gift
any human being can give to another:

238
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:10,544
Life!

239
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:15,340
I introduced 'er to this here planet, I did,
with all its wonders and marvels.

240
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:18,051
The sun that shines, the moon that glows.

241
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,138
Hyde Park to walk through
on a fine spring night.

242
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:25,851
The 'ole ruddy city o' London to roam
around in sellin' 'er bloomin' flow'rs.

243
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,561
I give 'er all that.

244
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,231
Then I disappears and leaves 'er
on 'er own to enjoy it.

245
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:33,609
If that ain't worth 'alf a crown
now and again...

00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,861
...I'll take my belt off and give 'er what for.

247
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:39,156
You got a good 'eart.
But you want a 'alf a crown out o' Eliza...

248
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,949
...you better have a good story.

249
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,202
ALFIE: Leave that to me, my boy.

250
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,538
- Good mornin', George.
- Not a brass farthin'.

251
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,756
Not a brass farthin'.

252
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,005
There she is.

253
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,682
Why, Liza, what a surprise.

254
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,728
Hop along, Charlie, you're too old for me.

255
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:36,064
- Don't you know your daughter?
- You don't know what she looks like.

256
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:38,984
I know 'er, I know 'er.
Come on, I'll find 'er.

257
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,932
Eliza, what a surprise.

258
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,600
Not a brass farthin'.

259
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:13,894
Hey, you come 'ere, Eliza.

260
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:16,438
I ain't gonna take me 'ard-earned wages...

261
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:19,399
...and let you pass 'em on
to a bloody pubkeeper.

262
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:29,743
You wouldn't send me 'ome
to your stepmother...

263
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,829
...without a drop o' liquid protection,
would ya?

264
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:34,706
Stepmother, indeed!

265
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:38,252
Well, I'm willin' to marry 'er.
It's me that suffers by it.

266
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,420
I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza.

267
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:43,382
Just because I ain't 'er lawful 'usband.

268
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:44,716
Come on.

269
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,845
Slip your ol' dad just 'alf a crown
to go 'ome on.

270
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,848
Well, I had a bit o' luck meself last night.

271
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:58,188
But don't keep comin' around
countin' on 'alf crowns from me!

272
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,108
Thank you, Eliza. You're a noble daughter.

273
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:08,156
"Beer, beer, glorious beer

274
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,492
"Fill yourself right up"

HENRY'S VOICE: See this creature
with her curbstone English...

276
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:37,477
...that will keep her
in the gutter till the end of her days?

277
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:41,607
In six months, I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

278
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:45,068
I could get her ajob as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

279
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:47,321
...which requires better English.

280
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:59,082
You disgrace to the noble architecture
of these columns!

281
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:08,133
I could get her ajob as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

282
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,385
...which requires better English.

283
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:39,039
How many vowel sounds
did you hear altogether?

284
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,832
I believe I counted 24.

285
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,877
Wrong by 100. To be exact you heard 130.

286
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,255
Listen to them one at a time.

287
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:49,341
Must I? I'm really quite done up
for one morning.

288
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,325
Your name, please?

289
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:16,994
Your name, miss?

290
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,997
My name is of no concern to you
whatsoever.

291
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:21,915
One moment, please.

292
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,552
London is gettin' so dirty these days.

293
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:37,514
I'm Mrs. Pearce,
the housekeeper. Can I help you?

294
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:41,226
Good morning, missus.
I'd like to see the professor, please.

295
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,936
Could you tell me what it's about?

296
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,606
It's business of a personal nature.

297
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,359
One moment, please.

298
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,622
- Mr. Higgins?
- What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

299
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:04,249
There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.

300
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,542
A young woman?

301
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,711
What does she want?

302
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,547
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.

303
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:12,674
I should've sent her away, only I thought...

304
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,760
...you wanted her to talk
into your machine.

305
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:17,638
- Has she an interesting accent?
- Simply ghastly.

306
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:20,724
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

307
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:24,978
This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.

308
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:28,982
We'll set her talking, then I'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...

309
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:32,236
...then in broad Romic.
Then we'll get her on the phonograph...

310
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:36,740
...so you can turn her on when you want
with the written transcript before you.

311
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:41,787
This is the young woman, sir.

312
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,163
Good mornin', my good man.

313
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:45,165
Might I 'ave a word with you?

314
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,751
Oh, no. This is the girl
I jotted down last night.

315
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:51,088
She's no use. I got the records I want
of the Lisson Grove lingo.

316
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:53,090
I won't waste another cylinder on that.

317
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,800
Be off with you. I don't want you.

318
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:58,053
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what I come for yet.

319
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,013
Did you tell 'im I come in a taxi?

320
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:03,141
Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman
like Mr. Higgins cares...

321
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:04,393
...what you came in?

322
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:06,061
Oh, we are proud.

323
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:09,481
He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
I 'eard 'im say so.

324
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:11,650
I ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

325
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:14,486
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

326
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,029
Good enough for what?

327
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:17,948
ELIZA: Good enough for you.

328
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:21,827
Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.

329
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,454
And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.

330
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,581
Well!

331
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,876
And what do you expect me to say?

332
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,213
Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, I think.

333
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:36,008
Don't I tell you I'm bringin' you business?

334
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,719
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...

335
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:41,221
...or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

336
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:45,726
I won't be called a baggage.
Not when I've offered to pay like any lady.

337
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,896
PICKERING: What do you want, my girl?

338
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:54,318
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...

339
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,237
...'stead of sellin' at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

340
00:28:57,321 --> 00:29:00,073
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

341
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,450
He said 'e could teach me.

342
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,619
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay 'im.

343
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,955
Not asking any favor
and he treats me as if I was dirt.

344
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:11,502
I know what lessons cost as well as you do
and I'm ready to pay.

345
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:15,797
How much?

346
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,966
Now you're talkin'.

347
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:20,719
I thought you'd come off it
for a chance to get back...

348
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,930
...a bit of what you chucked
at me last night.

349
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,723
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?

350
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,016
Sit down.

351
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:29,353
- If you're goin't' make a compliment of it-
- Sit down!

352
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,523
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

353
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:34,441
What's your name?

354
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:36,235
Eliza Doolittle.

355
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,613
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

356
00:29:43,492 --> 00:29:45,077
I don't mind if I do.

357
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:51,750
How much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

358
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,460
Oh, I know what's right.

359
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:56,421
My lady friend gets French lessons
for 18 pence an hour...

360
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:58,423
...from a real French gentleman.

361
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,843
You wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same...

362
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:03,762
...for teachin' me my own language
as you would for French.

363
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:07,224
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

364
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:12,437
Do you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...

365
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:16,775
...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income...

366
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:19,820
...it works out as fully equivalent of...

367
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,991
...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

368
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:28,245
By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.

369
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:32,541
Sixty pounds? What are you talkin'
about? Where would I get 60 pounds?

370
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:35,002
- I never offered you 60 pounds!
- Hold your tongue!

371
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:36,920
But I ain't got 60 pounds!

372
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:40,591
Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

373
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:44,011
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.

374
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:45,512
Sit down!

375
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,768
Anybody'd think you was my father!

376
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:55,522
If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

377
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:57,316
Here.

378
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:58,650
What's this for?

379
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:02,529
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part
of your face that feels moist.

380
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:05,574
Remember, that's your handkerchief
and that's your sleeve.

381
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:09,244
Don't confuse one with the other,
if you want to become a lady in a shop.

382
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:13,165
It's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.

383
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:16,877
Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!

384
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:19,046
Higgins, I'm interested.

385
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:20,506
What about your boast...

386
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:23,467
...you could pass her off as a duchess
at the Embassy Ball?

387
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,386
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you do that.

388
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,182
I'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

389
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,518
I'll even pay for the lessons.

390
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:35,229
You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.

391
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,690
It's almost irresistible.

392
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,487
She's so deliciously low.

393
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,322
So horribly dirty.

394
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:48,992
I ain't dirty! I washed my face an' hands
before I come, I did.

395
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:53,038
I'll take it. I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

396
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:56,959
We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

397
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:00,462
Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
Is there a fire in the kitchen?

398
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:03,590
Take her clothes off and burn them
and order some new ones.

399
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:06,301
Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

400
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:10,389
You're no gentleman, you're not,
to talk o' such things.

401
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:11,974
I'm a good girl, I am.

402
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:14,852
And I know what the likes of you are, I do.

403
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,730
We want none of your slum prudery here,
young woman.

404
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:21,233
You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

405
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:24,778
Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

406
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,697
I'll call the police, I will.

407
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,407
I've got no place to put her.

408
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,284
Well, put her in the dustbin.

409
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,412
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

410
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:36,081
You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.

411
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,667
You can't walk over everybody like this.

412
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,462
I?

413
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,048
Walk over everybody?

414
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:49,303
My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
I had no intention of walking over anybody.

415
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:52,556
I merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl.

416
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:57,227
I didn't express myself clearly
because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

417
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:58,770
...or yours.

418
00:32:58,854 --> 00:33:01,940
But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...

419
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:04,735
...as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach.

420
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:05,986
Why not?

421
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,947
Why not? But you don't know
anything about her.

422
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:11,825
What about her parents?
She may be married.

423
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:13,202
Garn!

424
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:16,705
There. As the girl
very properly says, "garn! "

425
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,082
Who'd marry me?

426
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,378
By George, Eliza...

427
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:27,591
...the streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men...

428
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:31,345
...shooting themselves for your sake
before I'm done with you.

429
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:35,140
I'm goin'.

430
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:38,977
He's off his chump, he is.
I don't want no balmies teachin' me.

431
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:42,231
Mad? All right, Mrs. Pearce,
don't order those new clothes.

432
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:44,525
- Throw her out.
- Stop! I won't allow it.

433
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,109
Go home to your parents, girl.

434
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:47,945
I ain't got no parents.

435
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,072
She ain't got no parents. What's the fuss?

436
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:53,492
Nobody wants her. She's no use
to anyone but me. Take her upstairs!

437
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:56,620
What's to become of her?
Is she to be paid anything?

438
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:57,996
Do be sensible, sir.

439
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,582
What'd she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.

440
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,251
She'll drink if you give her money.

441
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:04,086
You are a brute! It's a lie!

442
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,672
Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.

443
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:09,842
Sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let 'im speak to me like that!

444
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:13,136
Does it occur to you, Higgins,
the girl has some feelings?

445
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,348
No, I don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.

446
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:17,641
Well, have you, Eliza?

447
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:20,060
I got me feelings same as anyone else.

448
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:23,438
Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms
the girl is to be here.

449
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:25,941
What'll become of her
when you've finished teaching?

450
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:27,860
You must look ahead a little, sir.

451
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:31,196
What'll become of her if we leave her
in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?

452
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,615
That's her own business,
not yours, Mr. Higgins.

453
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,242
When I'm done, we'll throw her back.

454
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:38,662
Then it'll be her own business again.
That'll be all right, won't it?

455
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:41,081
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya!

456
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:44,084
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.

457
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:46,503
I've 'ad enough of this. I'm goin'!

458
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:48,630
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

459
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,632
Have some chocolates, Eliza.

460
00:34:57,389 --> 00:34:59,099
'Ow do I know what might be in 'em?

461
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:02,311
I've 'eard of girls bein' drugged
by the likes o' you.

462
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:04,271
Pledge of good faith.

463
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,481
I'll take one half.

464
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:09,067
And you take the other.

465
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:15,616
You'll have boxes of them,
barrels of them every day.

466
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:17,701
You'll live on them, eh?

467
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:22,706
I wouldn't've ate it, only I'm too ladylike
to take it out o' me mouth.

468
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:26,293
Think of it, Eliza.
Think of chocolates, and taxis...

469
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,712
...and gold and diamonds.

470
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,134
I don't want no gold and no diamonds.
I'm a good girl, I am.

471
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,804
Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

472
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:40,891
If this girl will put herself
in your hands for six months...

473
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:45,521
...for an experiment in teaching, she must
understand thoroughly what she's doing.

474
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:49,566
Eliza...

475
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,777
You are to stay here
for the next six months...

476
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,864
...learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop.

477
00:35:57,074 --> 00:36:00,786
If you're good and do what you're told,
you'll sleep in a proper bedroom...

478
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:05,165
...have lots to eat, money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.

479
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,710
But if you are naughty and idle...

480
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:11,630
...you'll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles...

481
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:14,758
...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

482
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:19,930
At the end of six months,
you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...

483
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:22,683
...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

484
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:26,854
If the king finds out
that you are not a lady...

485
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:31,275
...the police will take you to the Tower
of London where your head will be cut off...

486
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,361
...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls.

487
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:38,824
But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present of...

488
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:43,120
...seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

489
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:46,373
If you refuse this offer...

490
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:49,793
...you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl...

491
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,547
...and the angels will weep for you!

492
00:36:59,553 --> 00:37:00,929
Are you satisfied, Pickering?

493
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:03,098
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

494
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:05,642
Could I put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs. Pearce?

495
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:06,643
Come with me.

496
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:09,479
That's right.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

497
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:11,481
You're a great bully, you are!

498
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:14,818
I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me!

499
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,612
Don't answer back, girl.

500
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:20,574
I've always been a good girl, I 'ave.

501
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:24,995
In six months... in three,
if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...

502
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:27,831
...I'll take her anywhere
and I'll pass her off as anything.

503
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:30,834
I'll make a queen
of that barbarous wretch!

504
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:41,595
ELIZA: I've never had a bath in me life.
Not what you'd call a proper one.

505
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:45,349
You know you can't be a nice girl inside
if you're dirty outside.

506
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,644
I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.

507
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,691
I couldn't sleep in here, missus.

508
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,944
It's too good for the likes o' me.

509
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,989
I should be afraid to touch anythin'.

510
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:03,158
I ain't a duchess yet, you know.

511
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:12,167
What's this?
This where you wash clothes?

512
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:16,296
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza.
And where I'm going to wash you.

513
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,092
You expect me to get into that
and wet meself all over?

514
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:21,301
Not me!

515
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:29,601
I shall catch me death.

516
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,397
Come along now.

517
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,148
Come along.

518
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:37,317
Take your clothes off.

519
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,280
Come on, girl, do as you're told.
Take your clothes off.

520
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:43,740
Here, come on. Help me take these-

521
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:52,291
Take your hands off me!

522
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:14,313
I'm a good girl, I am!

523
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:20,319
It ain't right! It ain't decent!

524
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:28,994
ELIZA: Get your hands off me!

525
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,629
ELIZA: I'm a good girl, I am!

526
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:55,229
Forgive the bluntness,
but if I'm to be in this business...

527
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:57,231
...I shall feel responsible for the girl.

528
00:39:57,314 --> 00:40:01,276
I hope it's clearly understood that
no advantage is to be taken of her position.

529
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,029
What, that thing? Sacred, I assure you.

530
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:07,115
Come now, you know what I mean.
This is no trifling matter.

531
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,661
Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?

532
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:14,957
Have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned?

533
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,917
Yes, very frequently.

534
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:20,546
I haven't. The moment I let a woman
make friends with me...

535
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:22,923
...she becomes jealous, exacting...

536
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:25,259
...suspicious and a damned nuisance.

537
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:29,638
The moment that I make friends with
a woman I become selfish and tyrannical.

538
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:33,308
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so.

539
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:34,977
Well, after all, Pickering...

540
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:38,355
"I'm an ordinary man

541
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:40,190

551
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,426

From the cellar to the dome

"Then go on to the enthralling fun
of overhauling you!

"Make a plan and you will find
She has something else in mind

00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:30,407
"So rather than do either
You do something else that neither

559

I guess it's back to work.

Work! Don't you dare mention
that word in my presence again.

Just for exercise.

It's not worth it. Takes up your whole day.

622

Don't worry, boys.
We'll get outta this somehow.

623

How do you think you'll do that?

00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:12,976
You can buy your own drinks now,
Alfie Doolittle.

667
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,020
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.

668
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,396
What are you talkin' about?

669
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,773
Your daughter, Eliza.

670
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:20,359
You're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.

671
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:21,818
What about Eliza?

672
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:25,864
He don't know.
Her own father an' he don't know.

673
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:32,246
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.

674
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:35,332
Left here in a taxi all by herself,
smart as paint.

675
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:37,543
An' ain't been home for three days.

676
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:38,502
Go on.

677
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:41,380
MRS. HOPKINS: And this mornin'
I gets a message from 'er.

678
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:43,465
She wants her things sent over...

679
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:45,717
...to 27A Wimpole Street...

680
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:48,887
...care of Professor Higgins.

681
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:52,307
An' what things does she want?

682
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:55,352
Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.

683
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:00,983
MRS. HOPKINS: But she says:

684
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:03,861
"Never mind about sending any clothes. "

685
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,742
I knew she had a career in front of 'er.

686
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:13,036
We're in for a booze-up.

687
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:15,664
The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.

688
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:20,544
"A man was made
to 'elp support his children

689
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,131
"Which is the right and proper thing to do

690
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:28,177
"A man was made

00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:32,514
"With a little bit o' luck

692
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:35,726

693
00:49:36,852 --> 00:49:40,189

"With a little bit o' luck they'll work for you

"With a little bit

696
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:47,905
"With a little bit

00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:50,991
"With a little bit o' bloomin' luck!

698
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:02,586
ALFIE: "It's a crime for a man
to go philanderin'

699
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:06,548
"And fill his wife's poor 'eart
with grief and doubt

700
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:10,344
"It's a crime for a man

00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:33,033
"With a little bit o' bloomin' luck! "

706
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:50,926
The mail, sir.

707
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,929
Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.

708
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:41,727
You simply cannot go on
working the girl this way.

709
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,104
Making her say her alphabet
over and over...

710
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:46,940
...from sunup to sundown,
even during meals.

711
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:49,693
You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?

712
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:53,363
When she does it properly, of course.
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?

713
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:56,950
There's another letter from the
American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.

714
00:51:57,034 --> 00:51:59,244
He still wants you
for his Moral Reform League.

715
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:00,412
Throw it away.

716
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:03,999
It's the third letter he's written you.
You should at least answer it.

717
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:08,003
All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.

718
00:52:10,172 --> 00:52:14,259
If you please, sir. There's
a dustman downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...

719
00:52:14,343 --> 00:52:17,346
...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.

720
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:18,639
I say!

721
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,642
Well, send the blackguard up.

722
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:24,019
PICKERING: He may not be
a blackguard, Higgins.

723
00:52:24,102 --> 00:52:26,688
Nonsense. Of course
he's a blackguard, Pickering.

724
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:29,149
I'm afraid we'll have some trouble
with him.

725
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:33,737
No, I think not. Any trouble to be had,
he'll have it with me. Not I with him.

726
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,408
Doolittle, sir.

727
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:47,584
ALFIE: Professor Higgins?
Here!

728
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:49,127
Where?

729
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,547
Good morning, Governor.

730
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:55,008
I come about a very serious matter,
Governor.

731
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:00,556
Brought up in Houndslow.

732
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:03,183
Mother Welsh, I should think.

733
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:05,769
What is it you want, Doolittle?

734
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:08,397
I want my daughter, that's what I want.
See?

735
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,983
Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?

736
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:13,694
I'm glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left.

737
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:16,405
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

738
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:17,614
What?

739
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:22,119
Take her away. Do you think I am going
to keep your daughter for you?

740
00:53:22,244 --> 00:53:24,788
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

741
00:53:25,163 --> 00:53:28,208
Is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that?

742
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:31,628
The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.
Where do I come in?

743
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:35,507
How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me!

744
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:38,302
You sent her here on purpose!

745
00:53:38,427 --> 00:53:41,305
Don't take a man up like that, Governor.

746
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,057
The police shall take you up.
This is a plan...

747
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:46,518
...a plot to extort money by threats.

748
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,562
I shall telephone the police.

749
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:51,440
Have I asked you for a brass farthin'?

750
00:53:52,191 --> 00:53:55,777
I leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have I said a word about money?

751
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:58,030
Well, what else did you come for?

752
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:01,909
What would a bloke come for?

753
00:54:02,284 --> 00:54:04,077
Be 'uman, Governor.

754
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:12,002
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.

755
00:54:12,377 --> 00:54:14,046
So help me, Governor, I never did.

756
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:15,547
How did you know she was here?

757
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:18,509
I'd tell you, Governor,
if you'd let me get a word in.

758
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:21,470
I'm willing to tell ya.
I'm wanting to tell ya.

759
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,514
I'm waiting to tell ya!

760
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:29,269
You know, Pickering, this chap's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

761
00:54:29,478 --> 00:54:32,397
Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.

762
00:54:32,648 --> 00:54:36,610
"I'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting
to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you. "

763
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:38,862
That's the Welsh strain in 'im.

764
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:41,740
How did you know Eliza was here
if you didn't send her?

765
00:54:41,823 --> 00:54:45,327
Well, she sent back for her luggage
and I got to 'ear about it.

766
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,038
She said she didn't want no clothes.

767
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:53,418
What was I to think from that, Governor?
I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think?

768
00:54:53,877 --> 00:54:57,631
So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

769
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:00,467
- Yes, sir, Governor. That's right.
- Yes.

770
00:55:00,843 --> 00:55:02,261
Mrs. Pearce!

771
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,140
Eliza's father has come to take her away.
Give her to him, will you?

772
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:10,644
ALFIE: Now wait a minute, Governor.
Wait a minute.

773
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:14,273
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

774
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:18,861
Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.

775
00:55:18,944 --> 00:55:20,654
I think so indeed, sir!

776
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:22,698
ALFIE: Here, Governor.

777
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,701
I've took a sort of a fancy to you and...

778
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:32,416
...if you want the girl, I ain't so set
on 'avin' her home again...

779
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:35,419
...but what I might be open to
is an arrangement.

780
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:38,255
All I ask is my rights as a father.

781
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:42,009
You're the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing.

782
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:45,345
I can see you're a straight sort, Governor.

783
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:46,722
So...

784
00:55:46,972 --> 00:55:50,767
...what's a five pound note to you?
An' what's Eliza to me?

785
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:53,103
I think you should know, Doolittle...

786
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:56,356
...that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

787
00:55:56,732 --> 00:56:00,569
Of course they are, Governor.
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

788
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:03,906
You mean, you'd sell your daughter
for 50 pounds?

789
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:05,741
Have you no morals, man?

790
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:12,831
No, I can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me.

791
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:15,125
Not that I mean any 'arm, but...

792
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:18,712
...if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this,
why not me, too?

793
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:21,089
Why not?

794
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:26,345
Look at it my way. What am I?

795
00:56:27,513 --> 00:56:31,600
I ask ya, what am I? I'm one
o' the undeserving poor, that's what I am.

796
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:33,727
Think what that means to a man.

797
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:37,523
It means he's up against
middle-class morality for all the time.

798
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:42,069
If there's anything goin' an' I ask
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

799
00:56:42,152 --> 00:56:44,780
"You're undeservin', so you can't have it. "

800
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:48,951
But my needs is as great as the most
deservin' widows that ever got money...

801
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:53,539
...out of six different charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband.

802
00:56:53,622 --> 00:56:57,084
I don't need less than a deservin' man,
I need more.

803
00:56:57,584 --> 00:57:00,587
I don't eat less 'earty than he does
and I drink...

804
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,631
...a lot more.

805
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:04,925
I'm playin' straight with you.

806
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:08,720
I ain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, I'm undeservin'...

807
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:13,267
...and I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that's the truth.

808
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:16,603
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature...

809
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:20,649
...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up...

810
00:57:20,732 --> 00:57:23,443
...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...

811
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:28,657
...till she's growed big enough
to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

812
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:33,829
Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?

813
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,081
And I leave it to you.

814
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:42,504
You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...

815
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:47,009
...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.

816
00:57:47,426 --> 00:57:50,971
- We'd better give 'im a fiver.
- He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

817
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:53,307
ALFIE: Not me, Governor,
so 'elp me I won't.

818
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,893
Just one good spree
for meself an' the missus...

819
00:57:55,976 --> 00:57:59,062
...givin' pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

820
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:02,024
An' satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been throwed away.

821
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:04,067
ALFIE: You couldn't spend it better.

822
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:06,904
This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

823
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:09,198
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten.

824
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:10,991
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

825
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:14,620
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.

826
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:19,082
No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

827
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:22,503
I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality.

828
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:24,671
Why don't you marry that missus of yours?

829
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:28,175
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

830
00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:29,885
Who told you that, Governor?

831
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:32,804
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally...

832
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:40,270
If we listen to this man for another minute
we'll have no convictions left.

833
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:43,190
- Five pounds, I think you said.
- Thank you, Governor.

834
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:44,650
Are you sure you won't have ten?

835
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:46,818
No. No, perhaps another time.

836
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:48,904
ELIZA: I won't, I won't!

837
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:50,239
I beg your pardon, miss.

838
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:53,075
I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

839
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:54,826
Blimey, it's Eliza.

840
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:57,704
ALFIE: I never thought she'd clean up
so good-looking.

841
00:58:57,788 --> 00:58:59,790
She does me credit, don't she?

842
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:01,917
What are you doin' here?

843
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:06,964
Now, you hold your tongue and don't
you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

844
00:59:07,506 --> 00:59:10,843
If you have any trouble with 'er,
give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

845
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:13,220
That's the way to improve 'er mind.

846
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:16,223
Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.

847
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:23,605
There's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water.

848
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:27,442
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford
and tell him...

849
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:30,863
...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch
with Mr. Doolittle...

850
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:34,741
...a common dustman, one of
the most original moralists in England.

851
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:36,702
What did he come for?

852
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:38,120
Say your vowels.

853
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:40,247
I know me vowels.
I knew 'em before I come.

854
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:41,623
If you know them, say them.

855
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:43,750
Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

856
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:47,337
A, E, I, O, U.

857
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:51,425
That's what I said. Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

858
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:54,344
That's what I've said for three days
an' I won't no more.

859
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:57,556
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.

860
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:00,851
There's no use explaining.
As a military man you should know that.

861
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:02,477
Drilling is what she needs.

862
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:04,980
Leave her alone or she'll turn to you
for sympathy.

863
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:08,108
Very well, if you insist,
but have a little patience with her.

864
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:09,401
Of course.

865
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:11,320
Say "A."

866
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,739
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't.

867
01:00:21,246 --> 01:00:25,292
I promise you, you'll say your vowels
correctly before this day is out...

868
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:29,338
...or there'll be no lunch,
no dinner, and no chocolates.

869
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:44,811
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'Iggins

906
01:04:02,342 --> 01:04:04,595
All right, Eliza, say it again.

"The rine in Spine...

Didn't I saiy that?

911
01:04:17,482 --> 01:04:21,028
No, Eliza, you didn't "saiy" that.
You didn't even "say" that.

912
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:24,740
Every night before you go to bed,
where you used to say your prayers...

913
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:26,033
...I want you to say:

914
01:04:26,116 --> 01:04:29,244
"The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain. "

915
01:04:29,578 --> 01:04:30,746
Fifty times.

916
01:04:31,288 --> 01:04:35,459
You'll get much further with the Lord
if you learn not to offend His ears.

917
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,711
Now for your "H's. "

918
01:04:38,921 --> 01:04:40,881
Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.

919
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:43,175
Control yourself, Higgins.
Give the girl a chance.

920
01:04:43,258 --> 01:04:46,220
I suppose you can't expect her
to get it right the first time.

921
01:04:46,303 --> 01:04:48,889
Come here, Eliza,
and watch closely.

922
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:54,353
Now, you see that flame?

923
01:04:54,645 --> 01:04:58,148
Every time you pronounce the letter "H"
correctly the flame will waver...

924
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:01,527
...and every time you drop your "H"
the flame will remain stationary.

925
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:03,320
That's how to know
you've done it correctly.

926
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:05,280
In time, your ear will hear the difference.

927
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:09,034
You'll see it better in the mirror.
Now listen carefully.

928
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:12,538
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire...

929
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:15,707
"... hurricanes hardly ever happen. "

930
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:19,586
Now you repeat that after me.

931
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:23,841
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen. "

932

"In 'artford, 'ereford and 'ampshire

933
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:30,347
Oh, no, no!

934
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:32,558
Have you no ear at all?

935
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:34,852
- Should I do it over?
- No, please.

936
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:38,188
Start from the very beginning.
Just do this.

937
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:39,857
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

938
01:05:42,818 --> 01:05:44,403
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

939
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:48,949
Go on, go on.

940
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:55,247
Does the same thing hold true in India?

941
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,417
Have they the peculiar habit
of not only dropping a letter...

942
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,546
...but using it where it doesn't belong,
like "hever" instead of "ever"?

943
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:27,029
The girl, Higgins!

944
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:28,322
Go on. Go on.

945
01:06:30,282 --> 01:06:33,118
"Poor Professor Higgins

946
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:36,538
"Poor Professor Higgins

Again, Eliza.

954
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:12,908
How kind of you to let me come.

955
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:17,371
How kind of you to let me come.

956
01:07:17,454 --> 01:07:19,248
No. "Kind of you. "

957
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:22,543
How kind of you to let me come.

958
01:07:23,752 --> 01:07:26,129
How kind of you to let me come.

959
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:29,174
Kind of you. It's like "cup of tea. "

960
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:32,094
Kind of you. Cup of tea. Say, "cup of tea. "

961
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:33,345
Cuppatea.

962
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:35,264
No. "A cup of tea. "

963
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:39,935
It's awfully good cake.
I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.

964
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:44,940
First rate. And those strawberry tarts
are delicious. Did you try the pline cake?

965
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:51,905
Try it again.

966
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:54,741
PICKERING: Did you try the-
Pickering!

967
01:07:55,534 --> 01:07:56,827
Again, Eliza.

968
01:07:56,952 --> 01:07:58,203
Cuppatea.

969
01:07:58,287 --> 01:07:59,329
Oh, no.

970
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:01,415
Can't you hear the difference?

971
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:06,253
Look, put your tongue forward until
it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.

972
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:08,589
And then say "cup. "

973
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:11,717
Then say "of. "

974
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:14,887
Then say "cup, cup, cup, cup, of, of, of, of. "

975
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:21,226
PICKERING: By Jove, Higgins,
that was a glorious tea.

976
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:24,563
You finish the last strawberry tart.
I couldn't eat another thing.

977
01:08:24,646 --> 01:08:27,399
I couldn't touch it.
PICKERING: Shame to waste it.

978
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:32,279
Oh, it won't be wasted. I know somebody
who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.

979
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:44,374
"Poor Professor Higgins

Five.

01:09:20,035 --> 01:09:21,495
Six marbles.

I want you to read this
and I want you to enunciate...

990
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:29,795
...every word just as if the marbles
were not in your mouth.

991
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:33,257
"With blackest moss, the flower pots...

01:09:33,632 --> 01:09:36,051
"... were thickly crusted, one and all. "

01:09:36,426 --> 01:09:38,262

are those pebbles really necessary?

they are necessary for Eliza Doolittle.

Just think what you're dealing with.

1036
01:12:10,163 --> 01:12:13,375
The majesty and grandeur
of the English language...

1037
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:16,044
It's the greatest possession we have.

1038
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:20,215
The noblest thoughts that ever flowed

And that's what you've set yourself
out to conquer, Eliza.

1042
01:12:33,312 --> 01:12:36,190
And conquer it you will.

1043
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:03,967

We're making fine progress, Pickering.
I think the time has come to try her out.

1070
01:15:51,885 --> 01:15:53,595
Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins?

1071
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:55,264
Yes, I'm feeling fine. How are you?

1072
01:15:55,347 --> 01:15:56,723
- Very well, thank you.
- Good.

1073
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:59,518
Let's test her in public
and see how she fares.

1074
01:15:59,643 --> 01:16:03,063
Mr. Higgins, I was awakened
by a dreadful pounding.

1075
01:16:03,397 --> 01:16:04,982
Do you know what it might have been?

1076
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:07,818
I didn't hear any pounding.
Did you, Pickering?

1077
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,696
If this goes on, you'd better see a doctor.

1078
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:12,739
I know. We'll take her to the races.

1079
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:14,074
PICKERING: The races?

1080
01:16:14,157 --> 01:16:15,617

1081
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:19,246
- You'll consult your mother first, of course.
- Yes, of course.

1082
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:24,626
No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.

1083
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:27,588
First thing in the morning,
we'll go and buy her a dress.

1084
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:29,298
Now get on with your work, Eliza.

1085
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:32,176
But, Mr. Higgins,
it's early in the morning.

1086
01:16:32,259 --> 01:16:34,845
What better time to work
than early in the morning?

1087
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:36,805
Where does one buy a lady's gown?

1088
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,182
Whitely's, of course.

1089
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:39,349
How do you know that?

1090
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:40,851
Common knowledge.

1091
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:42,853
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.

1092
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:46,523
I despise those gowns with weeds here
and weeds there.

1093
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:50,152
We'll buy something simple and modest...

1094
01:16:50,235 --> 01:16:52,529
...and elegant. That's what's called for.

1095
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:54,406
Perhaps with a bow.

1096
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,910
Yes. That's just right.

1097
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:02,581
You've all
been working too hard.

1098
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:04,833
I think the strain is beginning to show.

1099
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:07,211
Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says.

1100
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:09,671

"Running of the Ascot opening race! "

1167
01:24:46,003 --> 01:24:47,254
Mother!

1168
01:24:49,047 --> 01:24:51,133
Henry! What a disagreeable surprise.

1169
01:24:51,216 --> 01:24:52,467
Hello, Mother.

1170
01:24:52,968 --> 01:24:54,094
How nice you look.

1171
01:24:54,178 --> 01:24:57,556
What are you doing here? You promised
never to come to Ascot. Go home.

1172
01:24:57,639 --> 01:24:59,183
I can't. I'm here on business.

1173
01:24:59,266 --> 01:25:02,102
You must. I'm quite serious.
You'll offend all my friends.

1174
01:25:02,186 --> 01:25:04,646
The moment they meet you
I never see them again.

1175
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:06,523
Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot.

1176
01:25:06,607 --> 01:25:09,151
I changed my shirt.
Mother, I've got a job for you.

1177
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:11,737
A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.

1178
01:25:12,362 --> 01:25:14,656
Not a love affair. She's a flower girl.

1179
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:18,202
I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball
but I wanted to try her out first.

1180
01:25:18,285 --> 01:25:21,371
- I beg your pardon?
- Well, you know the Embassy Ball.

1181
01:25:21,914 --> 01:25:24,791
So I invited her to your box today,
do you understand?

1182
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,335
Common flower girl?

1183
01:25:26,502 --> 01:25:28,462
I taught her how to speak properly.

1184
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:30,839
She has strict instructions
as to her behavior.

1185
01:25:30,923 --> 01:25:34,343
She's to keep to two subjects:
the weather and everybody's health.

1186
01:25:34,426 --> 01:25:37,596
"Fine day! " and "How do you do?"
Not let herself go on.

1187
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,723
Help her along. You'll be quite safe.

1188
01:25:39,806 --> 01:25:42,017
Safe? To talk about one's health
in the middle of a race?

1189
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:44,144
She's got to talk about something.

1190
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:45,437
Where is the girl now?

1191
01:25:45,521 --> 01:25:48,815
She's being pinned. Some of the clothes
we bought her didn't fit.

1192
01:25:48,899 --> 01:25:51,818
I told Pickering we should have
taken her with us.

1193
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:57,699
- Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.

1194
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:00,410
You know my son, Henry.

1195
01:26:00,494 --> 01:26:01,745
How do you do?

1196
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,706
- I've seen you somewhere before.
- I don't know.

1197
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:07,292
It doesn't matter. You better sit down.

1198
01:26:10,838 --> 01:26:12,756
Where the devil can they be?

1199
01:26:46,456 --> 01:26:49,918
MRS. HIGGINS: Colonel Pickering,
you're just in time for tea.

1200
01:26:50,002 --> 01:26:53,088
Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

1201
01:26:53,172 --> 01:26:55,257
MRS. HIGGINS: My dear Miss Doolittle.

1202
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:57,509
How kind of you to let me come.

1203
01:26:57,593 --> 01:26:59,761
MRS. HIGGINS: Delighted, my dear.

1204
01:27:00,053 --> 01:27:02,055
- Lady Boxington.
- How do you do?

1205
01:27:03,015 --> 01:27:04,057
How do you do?

1206
01:27:04,141 --> 01:27:06,018
- Lord Boxington.
- How do you do?

1207
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:07,019
How do you do?

1208
01:27:07,102 --> 01:27:10,022
- Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.
- How do you do?

1209
01:27:10,105 --> 01:27:11,607
How do you do?

1210
01:27:11,857 --> 01:27:14,276
MRS. HIGGINS: And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1211
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:16,445
How do you do?

1212
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,324
How do you do?

1213
01:27:21,116 --> 01:27:22,409
Miss Doolittle.

1214
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:25,204
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.

1215
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:37,758
The first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.

1216
01:27:37,841 --> 01:27:40,093
I'm so sorry that you missed it.

1217
01:27:40,302 --> 01:27:42,137
Will it rain, do you think?

1218
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:45,557
"The rain in Spain stays mainly
in the plain. "

1219
01:27:51,647 --> 01:27:56,151
"But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen. "

1220
01:27:56,902 --> 01:27:58,987
How awfully funny.

1221
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:02,616
What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it right.

1222
01:28:02,908 --> 01:28:03,992
Smashing.

1223
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:06,995
LADY BOXINGTON:
Has it suddenly turned chilly?

1224
01:28:07,246 --> 01:28:10,624
I do hope we won't have
any unseasonable cold spells.

1225
01:28:10,874 --> 01:28:12,668
They bring on so much influenza.

1226
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:15,921
LADY BOXINGTON: And the whole
of our family is susceptible to it.

1227
01:28:16,004 --> 01:28:18,465
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.

1228
01:28:20,676 --> 01:28:23,804
But it's my belief they done
the old woman in.

1229
01:28:25,681 --> 01:28:27,474
MRS. HIGGINS: Done her in?

1230
01:28:27,599 --> 01:28:29,309
Yes, Lord love you.

1231
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,812
Why should she die of influenza...

1232
01:28:32,062 --> 01:28:35,858
...when she'd come through diphtheria
right enough the year before.

1233
01:28:36,108 --> 01:28:38,318
Fairly blue with it she was.

1234
01:28:38,986 --> 01:28:40,863
They all thought she was dead.

1235
01:28:40,946 --> 01:28:44,366
But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.

1236
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:53,834
Then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl off the spoon.

1237
01:28:55,711 --> 01:28:57,004
Dear me!

1238
01:28:58,338 --> 01:29:01,675
Now what call would a woman
with that strength in her...

1239
01:29:01,758 --> 01:29:03,677
...have to die of influenza?

1240
01:29:04,386 --> 01:29:08,557
And what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?

1241
01:29:11,268 --> 01:29:13,103
Somebody pinched it.

1242
01:29:14,855 --> 01:29:16,607
And what I say is:

1243
01:29:16,857 --> 01:29:19,359
Them 'as pinched it, done her in.

1244
01:29:21,069 --> 01:29:23,614
Done her in? "Done her in," did you say?

1245
01:29:24,323 --> 01:29:25,991
Whatever does it mean?

1246
01:29:26,116 --> 01:29:30,370
That's the new small talk.
"To do somebody in" means to kill them.

1247
01:29:31,371 --> 01:29:34,458
But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?

1248
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:36,335
Do I not?

1249
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:41,048
Them she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

1250
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:44,510
MRS. HIGGINS: But it can't have been right
for your father...

1251
01:29:44,593 --> 01:29:47,304
...to pour spirits down her throat like that.

1252
01:29:47,596 --> 01:29:49,264
It might have killed her.

1253
01:29:49,348 --> 01:29:52,142
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.

1254
01:29:53,519 --> 01:29:57,981
Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of it.

1255
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:01,151
Do you mean that he drank?

1256
01:30:01,235 --> 01:30:03,862
Drank? My word. Something chronic.

1257
01:30:07,908 --> 01:30:10,410
Here, what are you sniggering at?

1258
01:30:11,662 --> 01:30:14,790
The new small talk.
You do it so awfully well.

1259
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:18,669
Well, if I was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?

1260
01:30:19,628 --> 01:30:21,922
Have I said anything I oughtn't?

1261
01:30:23,841 --> 01:30:25,425
Not at all, my dear.

1262
01:30:25,634 --> 01:30:27,594
Well, that's a mercy anyhow.

1263
01:30:30,597 --> 01:30:34,142
I don't know if there's time
before the next race to place a bet...

1264
01:30:34,226 --> 01:30:36,061
...but come, my dear.

1265
01:30:36,436 --> 01:30:40,107
I have a bet on number seven.
I should be so happy if you would take it.

1266
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:42,317
You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.

1267
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:44,027
That's very kind of you.

1268
01:30:44,111 --> 01:30:45,654
His name is Dover.

1269
01:30:45,737 --> 01:30:47,364
PICKERING: Come along.

1270
01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:52,160
"There they are again

1271
01:30:52,244 --> 01:30:53,871
"Lining up to run

1272
01:30:54,329 --> 01:30:56,039
"Now they're holding steady

1273
01:30:56,123 --> 01:30:58,417
"They are ready for it. Look!

1274
01:30:59,459 --> 01:31:01,003
"It has begun"

1275
01:31:07,634 --> 01:31:09,428
Come on. Come on, Dover.

1276
01:31:10,387 --> 01:31:11,388
Come on.

1277
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,265
Come on, Dover!

1278
01:31:13,432 --> 01:31:14,474
Come on!

1279
01:31:18,812 --> 01:31:21,690
Come on, Dover!
Move your bloomin' arse!

1280
01:31:29,489 --> 01:31:30,866
Oh, my dear.

1281
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:49,718
You're not serious, Henry. You don't
expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.

1282
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:51,345
Don't you think she's ready for it?

1283
01:31:51,428 --> 01:31:53,805
Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.

1284
01:31:53,889 --> 01:31:56,141
Her language may need
a little refining, but-

1285
01:31:56,225 --> 01:31:59,853
Really, Henry, if you cannot see
how impossible this whole project is...

1286
01:31:59,937 --> 01:32:01,605
...then you must be potty about her.

1287
01:32:01,688 --> 01:32:03,774
I advise you to give up
and not put yourself...

1288
01:32:03,857 --> 01:32:05,442
...or this poor girl through any more.

1289
01:32:05,526 --> 01:32:08,070
It's the most fascinating venture
I've ever undertaken.

1290
01:32:08,153 --> 01:32:11,615
Pickering and I are at it from morning
till night. It fills our whole lives.

1291
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:15,577
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza,
listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.

1292
01:32:16,745 --> 01:32:20,290
You're a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll.

1293
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:21,667
Here's the car.

1294
01:33:42,456 --> 01:33:43,916
Good evening, sir.

1295
01:33:43,999 --> 01:33:46,668
- Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
- Immediately, sir.

1296
01:33:46,752 --> 01:33:49,421
Good evening,
Professor Higgins.

1297
01:34:06,438 --> 01:34:10,234
"When she mentioned
how her aunt bit off the spoon

1298
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:14,571
"She completely done me in

1299
01:34:15,197 --> 01:34:18,158
"And my heart went on
a journey to the moon

1300
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:23,789
"When she told about her father
and the gin

1301
01:34:24,456 --> 01:34:28,377
"And I never saw a more enchanting farce

1302
01:34:29,169 --> 01:34:34,091
"Than the moment when she shouted
'Move your bloomin'- "'

1303
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:36,885
- Yes, sir?
- Is Miss Doolittle in?

1304
01:34:36,969 --> 01:34:38,804
Whom shall I say is calling?

1305
01:34:38,887 --> 01:34:42,182
Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
If she doesn't remember who I am...

1306
01:34:42,307 --> 01:34:45,227
...tell her I'm the chap
who was "sniggering" at her.

1307
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:46,311
Yes, sir.

1308
01:34:46,395 --> 01:34:48,313
And will you give her these?

1309
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:49,982
Wouldn't you like to come in?

1310
01:34:50,065 --> 01:34:52,192
They're having dinner,
but you may wait in the hall.

1311
01:34:52,276 --> 01:34:55,821
No, thank you. I want to drink in
the street where she lives.

1312
01:35:04,162 --> 01:35:09,126
"I have often walked
down this street before

1313
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:14,798
"But the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before

1314
01:35:15,591 --> 01:35:20,429
"All at once am I several stories high

1315
01:35:21,221 --> 01:35:25,809
"Knowing I'm on the street where you live

1316
01:35:27,144 --> 01:35:32,107
"Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?

1317
01:35:32,816 --> 01:35:37,654
"Can you hear a lark
in any other part of town?

1318
01:35:38,697 --> 01:35:43,452
"Does enchantment pour
out of every door?

1319
01:35:44,328 --> 01:35:48,999
"No, it's just on the street where you live

1320
01:35:50,542 --> 01:35:54,963
"And, oh, the towering feeling

1321
01:35:55,881 --> 01:36:00,302
"Just to know somehow you are near

1322
01:36:02,137 --> 01:36:06,517
"The overpowering feeling

1323
01:36:07,184 --> 01:36:11,730
"That any second you may suddenly appear

1324
01:36:13,398 --> 01:36:18,070
"People stop and stare,
they don't bother me

1325
01:36:19,196 --> 01:36:23,784
"For there's nowhere else on earth
that I would rather be

1326
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,996
"Let the time go by

1327
01:36:28,288 --> 01:36:32,125
"I won't care if I

1328
01:36:33,043 --> 01:36:37,673
"Can be here on the street where you live"

1329
01:36:40,926 --> 01:36:42,803
Oh, sir.

1330
01:36:45,055 --> 01:36:46,974
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1331
01:36:47,099 --> 01:36:50,227
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't want
to see anyone ever again.

1332
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:52,437
But why? She was unbelievable.

1333
01:36:52,521 --> 01:36:55,607
So I've been told, sir.
Is there any further message?

1334
01:36:56,441 --> 01:36:57,693
Tell her that I'll wait.

1335
01:36:57,776 --> 01:37:00,195
But it might be days, sir, even weeks.

1336
01:37:00,279 --> 01:37:02,823
But don't you see? I'll be happier here.

1337
01:37:11,748 --> 01:37:16,295
"People stop and stare,
they don't bother me

1338
01:37:17,754 --> 01:37:21,508
"For there's nowhere else on earth
that I would rather be

1339
01:37:23,594 --> 01:37:26,430
"Let the time go by

1340
01:37:27,139 --> 01:37:31,393
"I won't care if I

1341
01:37:32,436 --> 01:37:37,065
"Can be here on the street where you live"

1342
01:37:47,284 --> 01:37:49,912
It really is, Higgins.
It's inhuman to continue.

1343
01:37:49,995 --> 01:37:53,040
Do you realize what you've got to teach
this girl in six weeks?

1344
01:37:53,123 --> 01:37:56,084
You've got to teach her to walk, talk,
address a duke, a lord...

1345
01:37:56,168 --> 01:37:58,879
...a bishop, an ambassador.
It's absolutely impossible.

1346
01:37:58,962 --> 01:38:02,508
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call off the bet.

1347
01:38:02,591 --> 01:38:04,843
I know you're a stubborn man, but so am I.

1348
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:06,845
This experiment is over.

1349
01:38:06,929 --> 01:38:11,266
And nothing short of an order
from the king could force me to recant.

1350
01:38:11,725 --> 01:38:12,851
Excuse me.

1351
01:38:13,268 --> 01:38:15,646
You understand, Higgins? It's over.

1352
01:38:17,397 --> 01:38:20,192
Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the Embassy tonight...

1353
01:38:20,275 --> 01:38:22,903
...if Miss Doolittle suffers
any embarrassment...

1354
01:38:22,986 --> 01:38:24,238
...it'll be on your head alone.

1355
01:38:24,321 --> 01:38:25,572
Eliza can do anything.

1356
01:38:25,656 --> 01:38:27,449
Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.

1357
01:38:27,533 --> 01:38:29,409
Suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?

1358
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:32,162
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.

1359
01:38:34,206 --> 01:38:36,500
PICKERING: Think of how agonizing
it would be.

1360
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:39,253
If anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.

1361
01:38:39,336 --> 01:38:40,921
You could always rejoin your regiment.

1362
01:38:41,004 --> 01:38:42,840
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins.

1363
01:38:42,923 --> 01:38:44,967
The way you've driven her
the last six weeks...

1364
01:38:45,050 --> 01:38:47,135
...has exceeded all bounds
of common decency.

1365
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:50,222
For God's sake, stop pacing.
Can't you settle somewhere?

1366
01:38:50,305 --> 01:38:52,266
Have some port. It'll quieten your nerves.

1367
01:38:52,349 --> 01:38:53,684
I'm not nervous.

1368
01:38:55,310 --> 01:38:57,229
- Where is it?
- On the piano.

1369
01:38:58,772 --> 01:39:00,107
The car's here, sir.

1370
01:39:00,190 --> 01:39:01,859
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle.

1371
01:39:01,942 --> 01:39:05,571
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
I'll bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.

1372
01:39:05,654 --> 01:39:07,739
I warned you about these French designers.

1373
01:39:07,823 --> 01:39:11,159
We should've gone to an English shop.
They would've been on our side.

1374
01:39:11,243 --> 01:39:13,579
- Have a glass of port?
- No, thank you.

1375
01:39:19,918 --> 01:39:24,131
Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?

1376
01:39:24,715 --> 01:39:26,383
Well, we shall see.

1377
01:39:26,508 --> 01:39:28,677
PICKERING: Suppose she doesn't?

1378
01:39:29,511 --> 01:39:30,637
I lose my bet.

1379
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:34,892
PICKERING: There's one thing I can't stand
about you, your confounded complacency.

1380
01:39:34,975 --> 01:39:37,019
At a moment like this,
with so much at stake...

1381
01:39:37,102 --> 01:39:40,606
...it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of port.

1382
01:39:42,274 --> 01:39:46,028
And what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn't matter at all.

1383
01:39:46,111 --> 01:39:48,739
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.

1384
01:39:49,114 --> 01:39:51,533
What do you think I've been doing
all these months?

1385
01:39:51,617 --> 01:39:55,120
What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being...

1386
01:39:55,204 --> 01:39:59,416
...and change her into a different human
being by creating a new speech for her?

1387
01:39:59,499 --> 01:40:03,337
It's filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class...

1388
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:05,005
...and soul from soul.

1389
01:40:05,422 --> 01:40:07,549
Oh, she matters immensely.

1390
01:40:30,197 --> 01:40:32,699
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

1391
01:40:33,367 --> 01:40:34,952
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

1392
01:40:35,035 --> 01:40:36,954
Don't you think so, Higgins?

1393
01:40:39,665 --> 01:40:42,084
Not bad. Not bad at all.

1394
01:41:39,558 --> 01:41:52,362
Intermission

1395
01:41:56,366 --> 01:43:06,144
Entr'acte

1396
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:47,352
Maestro! Maestro!

1397
01:43:47,352 --> 01:43:48,520
Don't you remember me?

1398
01:43:48,604 --> 01:43:50,230
No. Who the devil are you?

1399
01:43:50,314 --> 01:43:53,775
I'm your pupil. Your first, your greatest,
your best pupil.

1400
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:56,403
I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.

1401
01:43:57,571 --> 01:43:59,531
I made your name famous
throughout Europe.

1402
01:43:59,615 --> 01:44:01,533
You teach me phonetics.
You can't forget me.

1403
01:44:01,617 --> 01:44:03,368
Why don't you have your hair cut?

1404
01:44:03,452 --> 01:44:06,997
I don't have your imposing appearance,
your figure, your brow.

1405
01:44:07,122 --> 01:44:09,166
If I had my hair cut,
nobody would notice me.

1406
01:44:09,249 --> 01:44:11,210
Where did you get these old coins?

1407
01:44:11,293 --> 01:44:12,961
These are decorations for languages.

1408
01:44:13,045 --> 01:44:15,005
The Queen
of Transylvania is here.

1409
01:44:15,088 --> 01:44:18,217
I'm indispensable to her
at these official international parties.

1410
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:21,220
I speak 32 languages.
I know everyone in Europe.

1411
01:44:21,303 --> 01:44:23,388
No imposter can escape my detection.

1412
01:44:23,472 --> 01:44:25,807
Professor Karpathy.

1413
01:44:27,643 --> 01:44:29,186
The Greek ambassador.

1414
01:44:29,978 --> 01:44:31,063
Greek, my foot!

1415
01:44:31,146 --> 01:44:33,941
He pretends not to know English,
but he can't deceive me.

1416
01:44:34,024 --> 01:44:36,443
He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

1417
01:44:37,152 --> 01:44:40,572
He speaks English so villainously
that he cannot utter a word...

1418
01:44:40,656 --> 01:44:42,908
...without betraying his origin.

1419
01:44:42,991 --> 01:44:46,745
I help him pretend, but make him pay
through the nose. I make them all pay.

1420
01:44:46,828 --> 01:44:50,123
Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs.
Her Excellency asked for you.

1421
01:45:09,852 --> 01:45:12,271
Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.

1422
01:45:15,232 --> 01:45:17,651
Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.

1423
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:22,197
Sir Guy and Lady Scot-Auckland.

1424
01:45:42,509 --> 01:45:44,678
The Count and Countess Demereau.

1425
01:45:45,387 --> 01:45:47,890
The Viscount and Viscountess Hillyard.

1426
01:45:48,056 --> 01:45:50,309
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.

1427
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,562
Lord and Lady Clanders.

1428
01:45:54,855 --> 01:45:57,733
Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering.

1429
01:45:58,066 --> 01:46:00,986
Miss Eliza Doolittle. Colonel Pickering.

1430
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:03,822
Professor Higgins.

1431
01:46:04,573 --> 01:46:06,658
- Your Excellency.
- Miss Doolittle.

1432
01:46:06,742 --> 01:46:08,035
How do you do?

1433
01:46:08,118 --> 01:46:10,412
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Good evening.

1434
01:46:11,413 --> 01:46:15,375
AMBASSADOR'S WIFE: What an enchanting
young lady you have with you this evening.

1435
01:46:15,459 --> 01:46:16,877
Well, who is she?

1436
01:46:17,044 --> 01:46:20,172
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.
Excuse me.

1437
01:46:21,089 --> 01:46:22,424
Professor Higgins.

1438
01:46:22,508 --> 01:46:26,303
Such a faraway look,
as if she's always lived in a garden.

1439
01:46:26,929 --> 01:46:29,097
So she has. A sort of garden.

1440
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:01,421
Henry must take Eliza home at once.
There's a language expert here.

1441
01:47:01,505 --> 01:47:04,675
- Sort of, you know, "imposterologist. "
- I beg you pardon?

1442
01:47:05,425 --> 01:47:07,970
The young lady with Colonel Pickering...

1443
01:47:08,095 --> 01:47:09,680
Find out who she is.

1444
01:47:09,930 --> 01:47:11,181
With pleasure.

1445
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:14,142
The whole situation is highly explosive.

1446
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:22,526
Tell me, Zoltan,
some more about the Greek ambassador.

1447
01:47:22,609 --> 01:47:26,196
Gladly, but first I would love you
to present me to this glorious creature.

1448
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,490
Does he really come from Yorkshire?

1449
01:47:37,332 --> 01:47:40,169
Her Majesty,
the Queen of Transylvania...

1450
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:43,338
...and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.

1451
01:48:29,718 --> 01:48:31,845
Charming. Quite charming.

1452
01:48:33,555 --> 01:48:35,349
Miss Doolittle, Madam.

1453
01:50:11,445 --> 01:50:14,489
Miss Doolittle, my son would like
to dance with you.

1454
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:10,879
Eliza?

1455
01:53:21,134 --> 01:53:23,220
PICKERING: Absolutely fantastic.

1456
01:53:26,431 --> 01:53:27,891
A lot of tomfoolery.

1457
01:53:27,975 --> 01:53:30,227
PICKERING:
It was an immense achievement.

1458
01:53:30,310 --> 01:53:31,770
Well, Mr. Higgins?

1459
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:34,940
A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph.

1460
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,443
Higgins, you were superb,
absolutely superb.

1461
01:53:39,111 --> 01:53:43,073
Tell us the truth now, weren't you
a little bit nervous once or twice?

1462
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:44,950
Not during the whole evening?

1463
01:53:45,033 --> 01:53:46,702
Not when I saw we were going to win.

1464
01:53:46,785 --> 01:53:48,787
I felt like a bear in a cage hanging about.

1465
01:53:48,871 --> 01:53:50,539
It was an immense achievement.

1466
01:53:50,622 --> 01:53:53,709
If I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given up two months ago.

1467
01:53:53,792 --> 01:53:55,127
Absolutely fantastic.

1468
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:56,753
Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.

1469
01:53:56,837 --> 01:53:58,755
Higgins, I salute you.

1470
01:53:58,881 --> 01:54:01,633
The silly people don't know
their own silly business.

1471
01:54:01,717 --> 01:54:04,803
"Tonight, old man, you did it
You did it, you did it

1472
01:54:04,887 --> 01:54:07,764
"You said that you would do it
And indeed you did

1473
01:54:07,848 --> 01:54:10,851
"I thought that you would rue it
I doubted you'd do it

1474
01:54:10,934 --> 01:54:13,896
"But now I must admit it
That succeed you did

1475
01:54:14,104 --> 01:54:16,732
"You should get a medal
Or be even made a knight

1476
01:54:16,815 --> 01:54:19,401
"Oh, it was nothing, really nothing

1477
01:54:20,194 --> 01:54:22,946
"All alone you hurdled
Every obstacle in sight

1478
01:54:23,197 --> 01:54:26,325
"Now wait, now wait
Give credit where it's due

1479
01:54:26,491 --> 01:54:28,869
"A lot of the glory goes to you

1480
01:54:29,703 --> 01:54:32,748
"But you're the one who did it
Who did it, who did it

1481
01:54:32,831 --> 01:54:35,751
"As sturdy as Gibraltar
Not a second did you falter

1482
01:54:35,834 --> 01:54:37,127
"There's no doubt about it

1483
01:54:37,211 --> 01:54:40,547
"You did it!

1484
01:54:43,717 --> 01:54:47,846
"I must have aged a year tonight
At times I thought I'd die of fright

1485
01:54:48,096 --> 01:54:50,599
"Never was there a momentary lull

1486
01:54:51,975 --> 01:54:55,604
"Shortly after we came in
I saw at once we'd easily win

1487
01:54:56,104 --> 01:54:58,857
"And after that I found it deadly dull

1488
01:54:59,525 --> 01:55:02,361
PICKERING: "You should have heard
The 'oohs' and 'aahs'

1489
01:55:02,444 --> 01:55:04,446
"Everyone wondering who she was

1490
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:07,199
"You'd think they'd never seen
a lady before

1491
01:55:07,908 --> 01:55:11,495
"And when the Prince of Transylvania
Asked to meet her

1492
01:55:13,205 --> 01:55:16,166
"And gave his arm to lead her to the floor

1493
01:55:18,252 --> 01:55:21,547
"I said to him: 'You did it
You did it, you did it'

1494
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:24,800
"They thought she was ecstatic
And so damned aristocratic

1495
01:55:24,883 --> 01:55:27,261
"And they never knew
That you...

1496
01:55:29,388 --> 01:55:30,556
"... did it"

1497
01:55:32,766 --> 01:55:34,643
Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.

1498
01:55:34,726 --> 01:55:36,979
If it hadn't been for him
I would've died of boredom.

1499
01:55:37,062 --> 01:55:39,314
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian?
Was he there?

1500
01:55:39,398 --> 01:55:42,401
Yes, he was there all right
and up to his old tricks.

1501
01:55:42,484 --> 01:55:45,362
"That blackguard
Who uses the science of speech

1502
01:55:45,445 --> 01:55:47,990
"More to blackmail and swindle than teach

1503
01:55:48,365 --> 01:55:50,868
"He made it the devilish business of his

1504
01:55:51,159 --> 01:55:53,954
"To find out who this Miss Doolittle is

1505
01:55:55,163 --> 01:55:57,624
"Every time we looked around
There he was

1506
01:55:57,749 --> 01:55:59,918
"That hairy hound from Budapest

1507
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,923
"Never leaving us alone
Never have I ever known

1508
01:56:05,007 --> 01:56:06,300
"A ruder pest

1509
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:12,514
"Finally I decided it was foolish
Not to let him have his chance with her

1510
01:56:14,558 --> 01:56:17,686
"So I stepped aside
And let him dance with her

1511
01:56:20,314 --> 01:56:25,444
"Oozing charm from every pore
He oiled his way around the floor

1512
01:56:25,777 --> 01:56:29,781
"Every trick that he could play
He used to strip her mask away

1513
01:56:30,574 --> 01:56:34,661
"And when at last the dance was done
He glowed as if he knew he'd won

1514
01:56:35,454 --> 01:56:38,582
"And with a voice too eager
And a smile too broad

1515
01:56:39,082 --> 01:56:42,419
"He announced to the hostess
That she was a fraud"

1516
01:56:43,504 --> 01:56:44,588
No!

1517
01:56:50,260 --> 01:56:54,681
"'Her English is too good,' he said
'That clearly indicates that she is foreign

1518
01:56:56,767 --> 01:56:59,561
"'Whereas others are instructed

"'Her blood,' he said
'Is bluer than the Danube is or ever was

01:57:28,757 --> 01:57:31,718

01:57:55,450 --> 01:57:59,162
"Congratulations,
Professor Higgins

01:57:59,663 --> 01:58:03,041
"For your glorious victory

1533
01:58:03,417 --> 01:58:07,045
"Congratulations, Professor Higgins

01:58:07,588 --> 01:58:11,049
"You'll be mentioned in history"

1535
01:58:33,739 --> 01:58:35,949
Well, thank God, that's over.

1536
01:58:36,491 --> 01:58:39,203
Now I can go to bed
without dreading tomorrow.

1537
01:58:40,370 --> 01:58:43,957
Good night, Mr. Higgins.
Good night, Mrs. Pearce.

1538
01:58:44,041 --> 01:58:47,920
PICKERING: I think I'll turn in, too.
Good night. It's been a great occasion.

1539
01:58:48,003 --> 01:58:49,630
Good night, Pickering.

1540
01:58:50,547 --> 01:58:51,882
Mrs. Pearce?

1541
01:58:52,799 --> 01:58:57,012
Damn, I meant to ask her to give me coffee
in the morning instead of tea.

1542
01:58:57,638 --> 01:59:01,475
Leave a little note for her will you, Eliza.
And put out the lights.

1543
01:59:49,231 --> 01:59:51,817
Must be downstairs. Oh, darn it.

1544
01:59:52,192 --> 01:59:54,027
I'll leave my head behind
one of these days.

1545
01:59:54,111 --> 01:59:56,738
What the devil have I done
with my slippers?

1546
01:59:59,449 --> 02:00:01,535
Here are your slippers!

1547
02:00:06,456 --> 02:00:10,252
Take your slippers and may you never
have a day's luck with them.

1548
02:00:10,961 --> 02:00:12,963
What on earth? What's the matter?

1549
02:00:13,046 --> 02:00:14,715
Is anything wrong?

1550
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:17,801
No, nothing's wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't I?

1551
02:00:17,885 --> 02:00:20,762
That's enough for you!
I don't matter, I suppose?

1552
02:00:21,346 --> 02:00:24,766
You won my bet?
You presumptuous insect! I won it!

1553
02:00:25,058 --> 02:00:26,727
Why did you throw the slippers at me?

1554
02:00:26,810 --> 02:00:30,272
Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute!

1555
02:00:30,355 --> 02:00:32,524
Why didn't you leave me
where you picked me up?

1556
02:00:32,608 --> 02:00:36,403
You thank God it's all over. Now you can
throw me back again! Do you?

1557
02:00:36,486 --> 02:00:39,072
Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?

1558
02:00:42,326 --> 02:00:44,912
Claws in, you cat!
How dare you show your temper to me?

1559
02:00:44,995 --> 02:00:46,580
Sit down and be quiet!

1560
02:00:46,663 --> 02:00:48,999
What's to become of me?

1561
02:00:52,461 --> 02:00:54,379
How do I know what's to become of you?

1562
02:00:54,463 --> 02:00:55,672
What does it matter?

1563
02:00:55,756 --> 02:00:58,425
You don't care. I know you don't care.

1564
02:00:58,509 --> 02:01:01,011
You wouldn't care if I was dead.
I'm nothing to you.

1565
02:01:01,094 --> 02:01:02,971
Not as much as them slippers.

1566
02:01:03,055 --> 02:01:04,139
Those slippers!

1567
02:01:04,223 --> 02:01:07,893
Those slippers! I didn't think it meant
any difference now.

1568
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:14,233
Why have you suddenly begun
going on like this?

1569
02:01:14,566 --> 02:01:17,236
May I ask if you complain
of your treatment here?

1570
02:01:17,319 --> 02:01:18,153
No.

1571
02:01:18,278 --> 02:01:21,406
Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?

1572
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:22,533
No.

1573
02:01:22,824 --> 02:01:25,911
Well you don't pretend
that I have treated you badly?

1574
02:01:26,703 --> 02:01:27,746
No.

1575
02:01:27,829 --> 02:01:29,748
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

1576
02:01:30,749 --> 02:01:33,627
Perhaps you're tired
after the strain of the day.

1577
02:01:34,294 --> 02:01:36,463
Would you have a chocolate?

1578
02:01:37,005 --> 02:01:39,383
No, thank you.

1579
02:01:41,677 --> 02:01:45,681
Well, it's only natural that you should
be anxious, but it's all over now.

1580
02:01:45,764 --> 02:01:47,641
Nothing more to worry about.

1581
02:01:47,724 --> 02:01:50,602
No, nothing more for you to worry about.

1582
02:01:51,937 --> 02:01:54,106
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

1583
02:01:55,274 --> 02:01:57,526
Why? In heaven's name, why?

1584
02:01:58,694 --> 02:02:02,447
Now listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.

1585
02:02:02,823 --> 02:02:05,075
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.

1586
02:02:05,158 --> 02:02:08,662
It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.

1587
02:02:08,745 --> 02:02:09,955
Go to bed and sleep it off.

1588
02:02:10,038 --> 02:02:14,501
Have a little cry and say your prayers.
You'll feel very much more comfortable.

1589
02:02:14,835 --> 02:02:16,670
I heard your prayers.

1590
02:02:16,837 --> 02:02:18,589
"Thank God it's all over. "

1591
02:02:18,714 --> 02:02:20,424
Don't you thank God it's all over?

1592
02:02:20,507 --> 02:02:22,926
Now you're free,
and you can do what you like.

1593
02:02:23,010 --> 02:02:26,138
Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?

1594
02:02:26,847 --> 02:02:29,433
Where am I to go? What am I to do?

1595
02:02:30,225 --> 02:02:32,311
And what's to become of me?

1596
02:02:33,395 --> 02:02:35,939
That's what's worrying you, is it?

1597
02:02:37,858 --> 02:02:39,818
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.

1598
02:02:39,902 --> 02:02:44,323
I'm sure you won't have any difficulty
in settling yourself somewhere or other.

1599
02:02:47,075 --> 02:02:49,703
I didn't quite realize you were going away.

1600
02:02:50,746 --> 02:02:52,706
You might marry, you know.

1601
02:02:53,081 --> 02:02:57,002
You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed
old bachelors like me and the Colonel.

1602
02:02:57,085 --> 02:03:00,088
Most men are the marrying sort,
poor devils.

1603
02:03:00,839 --> 02:03:01,840
You're not bad-looking.

1604
02:03:01,924 --> 02:03:04,426
You're really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimes.

1605
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:06,053
Not now, when you've been crying.

1606
02:03:06,136 --> 02:03:07,930
You look like the very devil, but...

1607
02:03:08,013 --> 02:03:12,476
...when you're all right and quite yourself
you're what I would call attractive.

1608
02:03:14,394 --> 02:03:16,730
Go to bed, have a good rest,
get up in the morning...

1609
02:03:16,813 --> 02:03:20,609
...and have a look at yourself in the glass.
You won't feel so bad.

1610
02:03:25,072 --> 02:03:28,909
I daresay, my mother might find some
fellow or other who would do very well.

1611
02:03:28,992 --> 02:03:31,245
ELIZA: We were above that
at Covent Garden.

1612
02:03:31,328 --> 02:03:32,788
What do you mean?

1613
02:03:32,871 --> 02:03:35,415
I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself.

1614
02:03:36,166 --> 02:03:39,294
Now you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.

1615
02:03:39,378 --> 02:03:42,047
Oh, tosh, Eliza.
Don't insult human relations...

1616
02:03:42,130 --> 02:03:45,175
...by dragging all that cant
about buying and selling into it.

1617
02:03:45,259 --> 02:03:47,344
Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.

1618
02:03:47,427 --> 02:03:49,054
What else am I to do?

1619
02:03:49,137 --> 02:03:50,973
Oh, there are lots of things.

1620
02:03:51,056 --> 02:03:53,475
What about the old idea of a florist shop?

1621
02:03:53,559 --> 02:03:56,603
I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.

1622
02:03:56,687 --> 02:03:58,647
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.

1623
02:03:58,730 --> 02:04:02,818
And that with the hire of the jewelry'll
make a big hole in 200 pounds.

1624
02:04:03,026 --> 02:04:05,404
Come on now. You'll be all right.

1625
02:04:06,572 --> 02:04:09,741
Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.

1626
02:04:11,076 --> 02:04:13,370
I was looking for something. What was it?

1627
02:04:13,453 --> 02:04:14,663
Your slippers.

1628
02:04:15,163 --> 02:04:17,916
Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.

1629
02:04:19,042 --> 02:04:21,170
ELIZA: Before you go, sir.

1630
02:04:25,090 --> 02:04:28,093
Do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?

1631
02:04:29,178 --> 02:04:31,388
What the devil use would they be
to Pickering?

1632
02:04:31,471 --> 02:04:33,473
Why bother about that
in the middle of the night?

1633
02:04:33,557 --> 02:04:35,017
What may I take away with me?

1634
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:37,519
I don't want to be accused of stealing.

1635
02:04:38,187 --> 02:04:39,271
Stealing?

1636
02:04:40,355 --> 02:04:43,650
You shouldn't have said that.
That shows a want of feeling.

1637
02:04:43,734 --> 02:04:47,779
I'm sorry. I'm a common, ignorant girl
and in my station I have to be careful.

1638
02:04:47,863 --> 02:04:51,325
There can't be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.

1639
02:04:51,408 --> 02:04:54,912
Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn't?

1640
02:04:55,370 --> 02:04:57,748
Take the whole damned houseful
if you want.

1641
02:04:57,831 --> 02:05:00,584
Except the jewelry. That's hired.
Will that satisfy you?

1642
02:05:00,667 --> 02:05:01,919
Stop, please.

1643
02:05:04,129 --> 02:05:07,508
ELIZA: Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?

1644
02:05:08,008 --> 02:05:10,928
I don't want to run the risk
of them being missed.

1645
02:05:12,513 --> 02:05:16,016
Hand them over! If these belonged
to me and not the jeweler, I'd...

1646
02:05:16,099 --> 02:05:18,685
...I'd ram them down
your ungrateful throat.

1647
02:05:18,977 --> 02:05:23,065
The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

1648
02:05:24,399 --> 02:05:25,943
I don't want it now.

1649
02:05:29,196 --> 02:05:30,864
Don't you hit me!

1650
02:05:31,365 --> 02:05:34,535
Hit you? You infamous creature!
How dare you suggest such a thing!

1651
02:05:34,618 --> 02:05:37,287
It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heart.

1652
02:05:37,371 --> 02:05:40,791
I'm glad. I've got a little
of my own back anyhow.

1653
02:05:42,125 --> 02:05:45,712
You've caused me to lose my temper.
That's hardly happened to me before.

1654
02:05:45,796 --> 02:05:48,590
I don't wish to discuss it further tonight.
I'm going to bed.

1655
02:05:48,674 --> 02:05:51,260
ELIZA: Leave your own note
about the coffee...

1656
02:05:51,343 --> 02:05:52,928
...for it won't be done by me!

1657
02:05:53,011 --> 02:05:56,181
Damn Mrs. Pearce,
damn the coffee and damn you!

1658
02:05:57,850 --> 02:06:01,103
Damn my own folly for having lavished
my hard-earned knowledge...

1659
02:06:01,186 --> 02:06:05,357

and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!

1660
02:06:56,617 --> 02:07:01,121
"Just you wait, 'Enry 'Iggins
Just you wait!

1661
02:07:03,207 --> 02:07:06,460
"You'll be sorry
But your tears will be too late

1662
02:07:09,463 --> 02:07:11,965
"You will be the one it's done to

1663
02:07:13,133 --> 02:07:15,636
"And you'll have no one to run to

1664
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:18,555
"Just you wait"

1665
02:07:47,251 --> 02:07:52,005
"I have often walked
down this street before

1666
02:07:53,006 --> 02:07:57,845

Darling.

1679
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:12,002
Freddy, whatever are you doing here?

1680
02:09:12,085 --> 02:09:15,964
Nothing. I spend most of my nights here.
It's the only place where I'm happy.

1681
02:09:16,048 --> 02:09:17,674
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

1682
02:09:17,758 --> 02:09:22,095
Don't you call me "Miss Doolittle,"
do you hear? Eliza's good enough for me.

1683
02:09:24,014 --> 02:09:27,601
Freddy, you don't think
I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

1684
02:09:27,684 --> 02:09:30,771
Darling, how could you imagine
such a thing? You know how I feel.

1685
02:09:30,854 --> 02:09:34,316
I've written two and three times a day
telling you. Sheets and sheets.

1686

"Speak, and the world

- I have.

Excuse me. For a second
I thought you were somebody else.

Who?

1742
02:14:23,897 --> 02:14:27,609
Forgive me, ma'am. Early morning light
playing tricks with my eyes.

1743
02:14:27,693 --> 02:14:30,612
Can I get you a taxi?
A lady shouldn't be walkin' alone...

Thank you, my good man. Thank you.
Here. Come 'ere.

Jolly spot this, Harry.
We must visit it more often.

1757
02:15:40,849 --> 02:15:41,808
Father?

1758
02:15:44,061 --> 02:15:46,980
Oh, no. You see, Harry, he has no mercy.

1759
02:15:47,689 --> 02:15:51,777
Sent her down to spy on me in me misery,
he did. Me own flesh and blood.

1760
02:15:54,738 --> 02:15:57,824
Well, I'm miserable, all right.
You can tell him that straight.

1761
02:15:57,908 --> 02:16:00,577
What are you talking about?
What are you dressed up for?

1762
02:16:00,661 --> 02:16:02,079
As if you didn't know.

1763
02:16:02,162 --> 02:16:06,166
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
Tell him what he's done to me.

1764
02:16:06,375 --> 02:16:08,001
What's he done to you?

1765
02:16:08,418 --> 02:16:09,670
Ruined me, that's all.

1766
02:16:09,753 --> 02:16:13,590
Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.

1767
02:16:14,007 --> 02:16:15,384
And don't you defend him.

1768
02:16:15,467 --> 02:16:20,013
Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to an old
American blighter named Wallingford...

1769
02:16:20,097 --> 02:16:24,184
...who was giving $5,000,000
to found Moral Reform societies...

1770
02:16:24,768 --> 02:16:29,356
...to tell him the most original moralist
in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

1771
02:16:29,439 --> 02:16:30,983
...a common dustman?

1772
02:16:32,484 --> 02:16:34,444
Sounds like one of his jokes.

1773
02:16:34,611 --> 02:16:37,823
You may call it a joke.
It's put the lid on me. Proper.

1774
02:16:38,115 --> 02:16:42,369
The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

1775
02:16:43,787 --> 02:16:47,916
Who asked him to make a gentleman
outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.

1776
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:52,713
I touched pretty nigh everyone for money
when I wanted it, same as I touched him.

1777
02:16:52,796 --> 02:16:56,300
Now I'm tied neck and 'eels
and everybody touches me.

1778
02:16:57,134 --> 02:17:00,012
A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...

1779
02:17:00,721 --> 02:17:02,806
...except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.

1780
02:17:02,890 --> 02:17:06,518
Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages
amongst the lot of them.

1781
02:17:07,144 --> 02:17:11,607
I have to live for others now,
not for meself. Middle-class morality.

1782
02:17:12,524 --> 02:17:15,861
Come on, Alfie, in a few hours
we have to be at the church.

1783
02:17:15,944 --> 02:17:17,863
- Church?
- Yeah, church.

1784
02:17:19,156 --> 02:17:21,074
The deepest cut of all.

1785
02:17:21,575 --> 02:17:24,786
Why do you think I'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

1786
02:17:25,329 --> 02:17:27,247
Your stepmother wants to marry me.

1787
02:17:27,331 --> 02:17:30,167
Now I'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

1788
02:17:30,250 --> 02:17:33,837
ELIZA: If that's the way you feel,
why don't you give the money back?

1789
02:17:33,921 --> 02:17:36,006
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

1790
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:38,133
It's easy to say chuck it...

1791
02:17:38,967 --> 02:17:40,802
...but I 'aven't the nerve.

1792
02:17:41,136 --> 02:17:43,764
We're all intimidated.
That's what we are, intimidated.

1793
02:17:43,847 --> 02:17:46,475
Bought up. Yeah. That's what I am.

1794
02:17:47,267 --> 02:17:49,937
That's what your precious professor's
brought me to.

1795
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:52,022
Not my precious professor.

1796
02:17:52,731 --> 02:17:54,650
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

1797
02:17:56,318 --> 02:18:01,240
First he shoves me in the middle-class,
then he chucks you out for me to support.

1798
02:18:01,865 --> 02:18:03,867
That's all part of his plan...

1799
02:18:04,493 --> 02:18:06,411
...but you double-cross him.

1800
02:18:06,995 --> 02:18:11,124
Don't you come back home to me.
Don't you take tuppence from me.

1801
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:15,295
You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, you can do it.

1802
02:18:15,379 --> 02:18:18,131
Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.

1803
02:18:18,799 --> 02:18:21,176
It's getting awfully cold
in that taxi.

1804
02:18:21,260 --> 02:18:25,305
ALFIE: Here, Eliza, would you like to
come and see me turned off this morning?

1805
02:18:25,389 --> 02:18:27,975
St. George's, Hanover Square, 10:00.

1806
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:30,143
I wouldn't advise it, but you're welcome.

1807
02:18:30,227 --> 02:18:31,728
No, thank you, Dad.

1808
02:18:32,896 --> 02:18:35,065
Are you all finished here, Eliza?

1809
02:18:35,649 --> 02:18:38,235
Yes, Freddy, I'm all finished here.

1810
02:18:42,573 --> 02:18:43,866
Good luck, Dad.

1811
02:18:44,241 --> 02:18:45,659
Thank you, Eliza.

1812
02:19:03,427 --> 02:19:04,469
Come along, Alfie.

1813
02:19:04,553 --> 02:19:06,555
ALFIE: How much time have I got left?

1814
02:19:06,638 --> 02:19:09,349
"There's just a few more hours

1815
02:19:09,474 --> 02:19:11,852
"That's all the time you've got

02:19:11,935 --> 02:19:13,645
"A few more hours

There's drinks and girls all over London.

1819
02:19:21,278 --> 02:19:24,740
And I gotta track 'em down
in just a few more hours.

1820
02:19:25,908 --> 02:19:27,201
Set 'em up, me darlin'.

1821

I told you, sir, she took them all with her.

1890
02:25:12,546 --> 02:25:15,382
Here's a confounded thing. Eliza's bolted.

1891
02:25:15,465 --> 02:25:18,719
Last night Mrs. Pearce let her go
without telling me about it!

1892
02:25:18,802 --> 02:25:21,346
What'll I do? I got tea this morning
instead of coffee.

1893
02:25:21,430 --> 02:25:24,099
I don't know where anything is,
what my appointments are.

1894
02:25:24,183 --> 02:25:25,976
- Eliza'd know.
- Damn it, she's gone!

1895
02:25:26,059 --> 02:25:28,187
Did either of you frighten her last night?

1896
02:25:28,270 --> 02:25:30,480
We hardly said a word to her.
You were there.

1897
02:25:30,564 --> 02:25:32,399
Did you bully her after I went to bed?

1898
02:25:32,482 --> 02:25:33,859
She threw the slippers at me.

1899
02:25:33,942 --> 02:25:35,861
I never gave her the slightest provocation.

1900
02:25:35,944 --> 02:25:38,447
The slippers came at my head
before I uttered a word.

1901
02:25:38,530 --> 02:25:42,409
She used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked! I don't understand.

1902
02:25:42,492 --> 02:25:45,162
We always gave her every consideration.
She admitted it.

1903
02:25:45,245 --> 02:25:46,121
I'm dashed!

1904
02:25:46,205 --> 02:25:49,750
Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something!

1905
02:25:49,833 --> 02:25:52,461
Phone the police. What are they there for?

1906
02:25:52,544 --> 02:25:55,047
You can't give Eliza's name to the police...

1907
02:25:55,130 --> 02:25:57,257
...as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella.

1908
02:25:57,341 --> 02:25:59,259
But why not? I want to find the girl.

1909
02:25:59,343 --> 02:26:02,054
She belongs to me.
I paid five pounds for her.

1910
02:26:02,304 --> 02:26:04,973
Quite right. Hello. Scotland Yard, please?

1911
02:26:05,307 --> 02:26:07,643

Miss Eliza Doolittle.

1917
02:26:24,826 --> 02:26:25,911
About 21.

1918
02:26:26,995 --> 02:26:29,248
I should say about 5 foot 7.

1919
02:26:31,124 --> 02:26:34,086
Her eyes? Let me think now. Her eyes...

1920
02:26:35,420 --> 02:26:36,964
- Brown.
- Brown.

1921
02:26:39,925 --> 02:26:43,887
Her hair? Good Lord.
Sort of a nondescript neutral sort of-

1922
02:26:44,721 --> 02:26:46,348
Brown, brown, brown!

1923
02:26:46,473 --> 02:26:49,142
You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yes.

1924
02:26:49,226 --> 02:26:51,728
No. This is her residence. 27A-

1925
02:26:51,812 --> 02:26:55,607
Yes, about between 3:00 and 4:00
this morning, I understand.

1926
02:26:56,775 --> 02:26:59,111
No... She's no relation, no.

1927
02:27:00,821 --> 02:27:03,740
Well, let's call her a good friend, shall we?

1928
02:27:04,199 --> 02:27:05,659
I beg your pardon?

1929
02:27:05,784 --> 02:27:08,537
Listen to me, I don't like the tenor
of that question.

1930
02:27:08,620 --> 02:27:10,998
What the girl does here is our affair.

1931
02:27:12,291 --> 02:27:15,752
Your affair is to get her back
so she can continue doing it.

1932
02:27:16,378 --> 02:27:17,880
Well, I'm dashed!

1933
02:27:20,841 --> 02:27:23,427
"What in heaven
could have prompted her to go?

at the Home Office. Perhaps he could help.

1938
02:27:38,483 --> 02:27:40,319
Think I'll give him a ring.

1939

1940

1946
02:28:12,142 --> 02:28:15,395

I beg your pardon?

1948

Nice to hear your voice.

Right. Yes, oceans of water.

Listen, Bruzzie, I'll tell you why I rang up.

1982
02:30:16,975 --> 02:30:20,729
Something rather unpleasant
has happened. Could I come and see you?

1983

I could, yes. Now, straight away?

1984

02:30:37,287 --> 02:30:39,581
I do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering.

1988
02:30:39,665 --> 02:30:41,458
Mr. Higgins will miss her.

1989
02:30:41,667 --> 02:30:45,295
Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?
Blast Mr. Higgins, I'll miss her!

1990
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:53,136
Pickering?

1991
02:30:57,224 --> 02:30:59,643
Mrs. Pearce?
Yes, sir.

1992
02:30:59,726 --> 02:31:00,727
Where's the Colonel?

1993
02:31:00,811 --> 02:31:02,980
He's gone to the Home Office, sir.

1994
02:31:04,022 --> 02:31:08,986
There you are. I'm disturbed and he runs
for help. Now there's a good fellow.

1995
02:31:10,821 --> 02:31:13,073
Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman.

1996
02:31:14,533 --> 02:31:17,369
"Why can't a woman
be more like a man?

1997
02:31:18,203 --> 02:31:20,831
"Men are so decent
Such regular chaps

1998
02:31:21,456 --> 02:31:24,084
"Ready to help you
Through any mishaps

1999
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:27,296
"Ready to buck you up
Whenever you are glum

2000
02:31:27,880 --> 02:31:30,174
"Why can't a woman be a chum?

2001
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:34,303
"Why is thinking
Something women never do?

2002
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:37,681
"And why is logic never even tried?

2003
02:31:38,432 --> 02:31:41,268
"Straightening up their hair
Is all they ever do

2004
02:31:41,476 --> 02:31:44,938
"Why don't they straighten up
The mess that's inside?

2005
02:31:45,022 --> 02:31:47,608
"Why can't a woman behave like a man?

2006
02:31:48,317 --> 02:31:50,903
"If I was a woman
Who'd been to a ball

2007
02:31:51,570 --> 02:31:54,239
"Been hailed as a princess
By one and by all

2008
02:31:54,907 --> 02:31:57,826
"Would I start weeping
Like a bathtub overflowing?

2009
02:31:57,993 --> 02:32:00,579
"Or carry on as if my home were in a tree?

2010
02:32:01,121 --> 02:32:04,124
"Would I run off
And never tell me where I'm going?

2011
02:32:04,374 --> 02:32:06,752
"Why can't a woman be like me?"

2012
02:32:11,423 --> 02:32:14,510
You mean that after you'd done
this wonderful thing for them...

2013
02:32:14,593 --> 02:32:16,094
...without making a mistake...

2014
02:32:16,178 --> 02:32:18,180
...they just sat there
and never said a word?

2015
02:32:18,263 --> 02:32:22,059
Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?

2016
02:32:22,142 --> 02:32:22,809
Not a word.

2017
02:32:22,893 --> 02:32:26,104
They just congratulated each other
on how marvelous they'd been.

2018
02:32:26,188 --> 02:32:28,690
The next moment, how glad they were
it was all over...

2019
02:32:28,774 --> 02:32:30,567
...and what a bore it had all been.

2020
02:32:30,651 --> 02:32:33,904
This is appalling. I should not
have thrown my slippers at him.

2021
02:32:33,987 --> 02:32:35,822
I should have thrown the fire irons.

2022
02:32:37,115 --> 02:32:37,991
Who's that?

2023
02:32:38,075 --> 02:32:40,494
Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.

2024
02:32:41,954 --> 02:32:43,914
MRS. HIGGINS: Now, remember...

2025
02:32:44,081 --> 02:32:48,418
...you not only danced with a prince
last night, you behaved like a princess.

2026
02:32:55,300 --> 02:32:58,011
Mother, the most confounded thing...
Do you-

2027
02:33:01,557 --> 02:33:02,474
You!

2028
02:33:03,308 --> 02:33:06,436
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

2029
02:33:07,896 --> 02:33:12,025
Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

2030
02:33:12,818 --> 02:33:15,696
Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.

2031
02:33:15,779 --> 02:33:17,531
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.

2032
02:33:17,614 --> 02:33:19,157
You've caused me enough trouble.

2033
02:33:19,241 --> 02:33:23,245
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.

2034
02:33:23,328 --> 02:33:24,913
How did this baggage get here?

2035
02:33:24,997 --> 02:33:27,958
Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.

2036
02:33:28,041 --> 02:33:31,003
If you don't promise to behave yourself
I'll ask you to leave.

2037
02:33:31,086 --> 02:33:33,088
I'm to put on my Sunday manners
for this...

2038
02:33:33,172 --> 02:33:36,967
...thing that I created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

2039
02:33:37,050 --> 02:33:38,802
That's precisely what I mean.

2040
02:33:38,886 --> 02:33:40,470
I'll see her damned first.

2041
02:33:40,554 --> 02:33:43,682
However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

2042
02:33:43,891 --> 02:33:48,228
It was very difficult. I should never have
known how ladies and gentlemen behave...

2043
02:33:48,312 --> 02:33:50,939
...if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.

2044
02:33:52,357 --> 02:33:54,610
He showed me that he felt
and thought about me...

2045
02:33:54,693 --> 02:33:58,071
...as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.

2046
02:34:00,699 --> 02:34:04,286
You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up...

2047
02:34:04,453 --> 02:34:08,207
...the difference between a lady
and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...

2048
02:34:08,290 --> 02:34:10,083
...but how she is treated.

2049
02:34:12,878 --> 02:34:15,380
I'll always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins...

2050
02:34:15,464 --> 02:34:19,092
...because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

2051
02:34:19,801 --> 02:34:21,929
I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...

2052
02:34:22,012 --> 02:34:25,307
...because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

2053
02:34:30,187 --> 02:34:31,647
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

2054
02:34:31,730 --> 02:34:34,566
The bishop is here.
Shall I show him into the garden?

2055
02:34:34,650 --> 02:34:37,152
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!

2056
02:34:37,236 --> 02:34:39,071
I should be excommunicated.

2057
02:34:39,363 --> 02:34:41,281
I'll see him in the library.

2058
02:34:42,032 --> 02:34:44,701
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...

2059
02:34:44,910 --> 02:34:47,621
...I give you full permission
to have him evicted.

2060
02:34:47,704 --> 02:34:51,917
Henry, I suggest you stick to two subjects:
the weather and your health.

2061
02:35:19,736 --> 02:35:21,780
You've had a bit of your own back,
as you say.

2062
02:35:21,864 --> 02:35:25,284
Have you had enough and will you
be reasonable or do you want any more?

2063
02:35:25,367 --> 02:35:27,369
You want me back to pick up
your slippers...

2064
02:35:27,452 --> 02:35:30,497
...and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

2065
02:35:30,581 --> 02:35:32,374
I didn't say I wanted you back at all.

2066
02:35:32,457 --> 02:35:33,834
Then what are we talking about?

2067
02:35:33,917 --> 02:35:35,544
Well, about you, not about me.

2068
02:35:35,627 --> 02:35:38,338
If you come back you'll be treated
as you always have.

2069
02:35:38,422 --> 02:35:40,674
I can't change my nature or my manners.

2070
02:35:40,757 --> 02:35:43,594
My manners are exactly
the same as Colonel Pickering's.

2071
02:35:43,677 --> 02:35:47,472
That's not true. He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

2072
02:35:47,598 --> 02:35:49,850
I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

2073
02:35:49,933 --> 02:35:52,102
I see. The same to everybody.

2074
02:35:52,561 --> 02:35:55,314
The great secret is not a question
of good manners...

2075
02:35:55,397 --> 02:35:58,859
...or bad manners
or any particular sort of manner...

2076
02:35:59,359 --> 02:36:02,696
...but having the same manner
for all human souls.

2077
02:36:04,615 --> 02:36:07,034
The question is not
whether I treat you rudely...

2078
02:36:07,117 --> 02:36:10,537
...but whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

2079
02:36:10,621 --> 02:36:12,581
I don't care how you treat me.

2080
02:36:12,664 --> 02:36:15,751
I don't mind your swearing at me.
I shouldn't mind a black eye.

2081
02:36:15,834 --> 02:36:18,921
I've had one before this.
But I won't be passed over!

2082
02:36:19,129 --> 02:36:21,006
Get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.

2083
02:36:21,089 --> 02:36:23,217
You talk about me as though
I was a motorbus.

2084
02:36:23,300 --> 02:36:27,513
So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

2085
02:36:27,763 --> 02:36:30,516
But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't!

2086
02:36:30,599 --> 02:36:33,018
I know you can. I told you, you could.

2087
02:36:36,438 --> 02:36:39,024
You've never wondered, I suppose,
whether...

2088
02:36:39,107 --> 02:36:41,652
...whether I could get along without you?

2089
02:36:42,736 --> 02:36:45,781
Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.

2090
02:36:46,990 --> 02:36:49,618
So I can, without you or any soul on earth.

2091
02:36:52,746 --> 02:36:56,959
I shall miss you, Eliza. I've learned
something from your idiotic notions.

2092
02:36:57,626 --> 02:37:00,170
I confess that humbly and gratefully.

2093
02:37:03,131 --> 02:37:05,509
Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

2094
02:37:05,592 --> 02:37:10,097
When you feel lonely without me you can
turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt.

2095
02:37:11,598 --> 02:37:14,351
Well, I can't turn your soul on.

2096
02:37:17,020 --> 02:37:18,689
You are a devil!

2097
02:37:20,232 --> 02:37:22,734
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily...

2098
02:37:22,818 --> 02:37:25,279
...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

2099
02:37:25,362 --> 02:37:27,197
What am I to come back for?

2100
02:37:27,531 --> 02:37:29,616
For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.

2101
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:32,452
You may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

2102
02:37:32,536 --> 02:37:35,956
Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

2103
02:37:36,039 --> 02:37:37,249
And live with my father?

2104
02:37:37,332 --> 02:37:39,877
Yes, or sell flowers.
Would you rather marry Pickering?

2105
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:43,714
I wouldn't marry you if you asked me
and you're nearer my age then what he is.

2106
02:37:43,797 --> 02:37:47,009
- Than he is.
- I'll talk as I like, you're not my teacher.

2107
02:37:47,092 --> 02:37:49,928
That's not what I want
and don't you think it is.

2108
02:37:50,012 --> 02:37:52,264
I've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

2109
02:37:52,347 --> 02:37:55,434
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

2110
02:37:55,517 --> 02:37:59,479
In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?

2111
02:37:59,563 --> 02:38:03,525
No, I don't. That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.

2112
02:38:04,651 --> 02:38:06,403
I want a little kindness.

2113
02:38:06,820 --> 02:38:10,532
I know I'm a common, ignorant girl,
and you're a book-learned gentleman...

2114
02:38:10,616 --> 02:38:12,868
...but I'm not dirt under your feet.

2115
02:38:13,118 --> 02:38:17,289
What I done... what I did was not
for the taxis and the dresses...

2116
02:38:18,540 --> 02:38:22,211
...but because we were pleasant together
and I come to... came...

2117
02:38:23,545 --> 02:38:25,047
...to care for you.

2118
02:38:25,339 --> 02:38:27,132
Not to want you to make love to me...

2119
02:38:27,216 --> 02:38:30,302
...and not forgetting the difference
between us, but...

2120
02:38:30,385 --> 02:38:32,054
...more friendly like.

2121
02:38:34,264 --> 02:38:36,517
Well, of course. That's how I feel.

2122
02:38:37,142 --> 02:38:40,270
And how Pickering feels.
Eliza, you're a fool!

2123
02:38:40,812 --> 02:38:42,189
That's not the proper answer.

2124
02:38:42,272 --> 02:38:44,233
It's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

2125
02:38:44,316 --> 02:38:46,485
To be a lady, you must stop
feeling neglected...

2126
02:38:46,568 --> 02:38:49,196
...if men don't spend half their time
sniveling over you...

2127
02:38:49,279 --> 02:38:51,323
...and the other half giving you black eyes.

2128
02:38:51,406 --> 02:38:53,825
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
don't you?

2129
02:38:53,909 --> 02:38:55,994
Off with you to the sort of people you like.

2130
02:38:56,078 --> 02:38:57,996
Marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money...

2131
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:00,832
...and thick lips to kiss you,
and thick boots to kick you.

2132
02:39:00,916 --> 02:39:04,086
If you can't appreciate what you have,
then get what you can appreciate.

2133
02:39:04,419 --> 02:39:07,256
I can't talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.

2134
02:39:07,339 --> 02:39:09,049
I'm always in the wrong.

2135
02:39:09,258 --> 02:39:11,510
Don't be too sure you have me
under your feet...

2136
02:39:11,593 --> 02:39:13,720
...to be trampled on and talked down.

2137
02:39:13,804 --> 02:39:17,349
I'll marry Freddy, I will,
as soon as I'm able to support him.

2138
02:39:17,558 --> 02:39:18,600
Freddy!

2139
02:39:18,809 --> 02:39:21,436
The poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy...

2140
02:39:21,520 --> 02:39:23,480
...even if he had the guts to try?

2141
02:39:23,564 --> 02:39:27,317
Don't you understand?
I have made you a consort for a king!

2142
02:39:27,484 --> 02:39:30,445
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

2143
02:39:30,529 --> 02:39:33,532
I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.

2144
02:39:33,615 --> 02:39:35,367
I'll go and be a teacher.

2145
02:39:35,784 --> 02:39:37,786
What'll you teach, in heaven's name?

2146
02:39:37,870 --> 02:39:40,414
What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics.

2147
02:39:44,793 --> 02:39:48,797
I'll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant Hungarian.

2148
02:39:49,923 --> 02:39:53,594
What, that imposter? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?

2149
02:39:53,969 --> 02:39:56,138
Teach him my methods, my discoveries?

2150
02:39:56,221 --> 02:39:58,849
You take one step in that direction,
I'll wring your neck!

2151
02:39:58,932 --> 02:40:02,394
Wring away! What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.

2152
02:40:05,647 --> 02:40:08,233
That's done you, 'Enry 'Iggins, it 'as.

Goodbye, Professor Higgins.
You shall not be seeing me again.

She's gone.

2204
02:43:19,925 --> 02:43:22,511
Well, of course, dear.
What did you expect?

2205

What am I to do?

2206
02:43:27,266 --> 02:43:28,892
Do without, I suppose.

2207
02:43:30,644 --> 02:43:32,229
And so I shall.

2208
02:43:35,649 --> 02:43:38,652

her little lungs...

2209
02:43:38,777 --> 02:43:41,530
...let her seek some stuffiness
that suits her.

2210
02:43:42,322 --> 02:43:45,742
She's an owl sickened
by a few days of my sunshine.

2211

Let her go. I can do without her.

2212
02:43:48,287 --> 02:43:50,747
I can do without anyone.
I have my own soul!

wicked, brainless thing to do.
