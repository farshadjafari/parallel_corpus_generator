1
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,210
You'll feel better now

2
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,650
What am I going to do?

3
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,630
Tommaso Garani, room 103

4
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,640
My 'phone is out of order.
I wonder if you could...

5
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,210
Could you tell the operator?

6
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,850
He's awake, but drugged with morphine

7
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,650
- Will you operate?
- No, it would be futile

8
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,330
Tommaso, are we disturbing you?

9
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,040
Come in, my dears

10
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,210
Operation successful, but
the patient died

11
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,950
Sit down

12
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,290
I see there's a party to
launch your book today

13
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,360
- Let's not talk about it
- Why not?

14
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,800
Your book is the one thing
that really matters

15
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,770
Lidia, why don't you sit down?

16
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,670
Smoke if you like

17
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,340
I don't feel tired

18
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,440
Here's the magazine with
your article on Adorno

19
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,410
What's your opinion? Shall I
include it in my book?

20
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,450
Yes, it's very good.
Your book will be excellent

21
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,650
I'll have to give it more thought

22
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,290
I haven't been able to think
these last few days...

23
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,630
...yet this is my first free time
in years

24
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,500
What an ironical holiday

25
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,140
Lidia, you look wonderful

26
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,610
- I told Marcella not to come
- Quite right

27
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,810
I'd rather not see anyone

28
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,280
I'm sick and tired of all the pretending

29
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,650
But I was hoping you would come,
of course

30
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,630
You know, I see things
in a clearer light now

31
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,600
I regret that my presence spoiled
so many evenings...

32
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,730
...in your delightful home

33
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,640
It's your home, too, you know

34
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,880
You appreciate many things
when you're all alone

35
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,650
You realize that so much
remains to be done

36
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,650
I wonder if I've ever done
anything really useful

37
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,060
I lacked the courage to probe deeply

38
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,260
Probably I never had enough
intelligence, anyway

39
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,930
If that's true, I'd better
pack up writing at once

40
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,670
You're joking

41
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,670
Occasional self-criticism
helps to raise morale

42
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,950
You bought it? I was going to
bring you a copy

43
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,620
I've not only bought it,
I've begun to read it

44
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,930
Fifty pages so far

45
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,500
I hope I'll finish it

46
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,500
The bath episode is exceptional

47
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,610
Unless morphine has warped my
judgement, it's your best

48
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,440
With morphine things seem different

49
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,620
It must be the morphine.
Do you really like the book?

50
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,650
I do

51
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,090
You'll end up a great success

52
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,520
Yes, I'll come to a bad end

53
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,290
The advantage of premature death:
you escape success

54
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,630
My mother

55
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,500
How are you, Tommaso?

56
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,380
Poor Mother, seven hours on a train
just to sit here

57
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,650
This is Saturday, isn't it?

58
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,330
Who have you seen lately?

59
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,900
Hardly anyone. We haven't done much
lately

60
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,440
We don't get out much,
except to drive around

61
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,640
What about your trip to Greece?

62
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,610
- We haven't decided
- Get well; it was your idea

63
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,950
Don't treat me as a patient;
I know how this will end

64
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,450
Sorry

65
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,890
My publisher will dispose of my
royalties. This must be paid for

66
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,600
It's nothing... I'm sorry...

67
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Don't tire yourself. Should we go?

68
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,110
No, please stay

69
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,630
Quite a place, isn't it?

70
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,970
Appalling style, but I never expected
to end in such luxury

71
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,040
I feel a bit of a fraud

72
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,510
Hospitals are getting more like
night clubs

73
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,220
People want a good time to the end

74
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,600
You know, in such cases one craves
champagne

75
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,630
I don't like it, but I've developed
a passion for it

76
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,970
They weren't surprised

77
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,640
It's stimulating; it's good for you

78
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,010
Excuse me, I've never dared to
ask your name

79
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,080
My name is Elena

80
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,820
Will you have a drink with us?

81
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,660
No, thank you. Don't tire yourself
with talking

82
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:27,630
She's not a nurse; just a beauty
to boost morale

83
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,200
Yet beauty is depressing
in certain circumstances

84
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,380
Giovanni, will you pour?

85
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,050
Only for me? What about Lidia?

86
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,390
No, thanks, Tommaso. I'd rather not

87
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,200
Giovanni, don't let me drink alone.
You, too, mother

88
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,080
I have to go, Tommaso.
You stay, Giovanni

89
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,290
I have to go. I'll come again
tomorrow

90
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,630
- Don't you want to go, too?
- I'll stay a little longer

91
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,640
Goodbye. See you soon. Tomorrow

92
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,970
They are my only real friends, mother;
others are just acquaintances

93
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,640
They're good people. Giovanni's
a writer, famous, too

94
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,610
If they ever visit you one day...

95
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,820
You must go there

96
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,990
...give them the room overlooking
the orchard

97
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,660
If that's your wish, I promise we'll go

98
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,970
I think they are using water,
not morphine

99
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,610
- How was that concert?
- I didn't go

100
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,170
Have you a match?

101
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,970
No, a match

102
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,270
Get up, please

103
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,650
I could do without this book party

104
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,120
- Are you too tired to go?
- No, I'm fine

105
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,390
Well, a little tired, perhaps

106
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,980
I must tell you something unpleasant

107
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,680
Must you?

108
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:49,020
Yes. It happened at the hospital.
Very unpleasant

109
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,950
I saw that girl again

110
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,660
- Which girl?
- The one in the corridor

111
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,330
At first I couldn't make out
what she wanted

112
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,500
You went into her room

113
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,340
She was like a wild animal.
I was carried away

114
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,510
Why was it "unpleasant"?

115
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:21,920
It was hideous. At first I thought
I'd provoked it. The nurses came in

116
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,090
Good story material. Call it
"The Living and the Dead"

117
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,490
- Is that your only comment?
- What else?

118
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,160
That you did something vile?
You disgust me?

119
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,000
No, I understand. You were taken
by surprise. Let's forget it

120
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,480
Perhaps she's the lucky one

121
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,950
Why?

122
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,110
She's uncontrollable

123
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,870
This is the ante-room of fame;
we all wait here

124
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,640
Please sign a copy for
our Nobel Prize winner

125
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,890
I see you sign on the left

126
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,060
- Do you prefer the left?
- Probably

127
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:47,630
Very interesting; you could have
a great future

128
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,630
- Now one for my collection
- For you: "In friendship"

129
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,810
- What are you writing now?
- Nothing

130
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,660
How I'd love to write a book

131
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:36,060
- Going away this weekend?
- No, I'm too busy

132
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,960
We'll talk later. Regards to Lidia

133
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,900
Isn't my wife back?
Hasn't she 'phoned?

134
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:03,640
- Shall I serve dinner?
- No, you can go. I'll wait

135
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,650
Wait here

136
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,000
Stop it! Stop it!

137
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,880
Wait

138
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,800
Do you still want me to wait?

139
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,800
The wind's strong up there

140
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:04,250
- Have you seen Lidia?
- No, I thought you were out

141
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,060
I'm fed up. Paolo has a cold;
we can't leave town

142
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,590
Ask Lidia to call round

143
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,560
She's not at home. I thought
she might be with you

144
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,800
No, I haven't seen her for days

145
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,590
It's you. Where are you?

146
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,130
I'm in Sesto San Giovanni

147
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,500
In the same old field...

148
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:31,040
...kids are still firing rockets;
you'll like it

149
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,640
They shoot up ever so high

150
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,450
No, don't worry. Nothing's wrong

151
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,960
Nothing, I tell you

152
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:57,630
Come and pick me up, will you? Hurry

153
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,440
If you're meeting someone, there's
a little hotel nearby

154
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,440
Why come here?

155
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,640
I just happened to come this way

156
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,870
It hasn't changed at all

157
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,040
It will before long

158
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:40,190
They were over there,
the boys with rockets

159
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,050
This line was in use when we lived here

160
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,980
Why have you moved the sponge?

161
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,730
I'm tired of staying in

162
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:53,430
- Let's go to that party
- Anywhere to get out

163
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:08,450
- Why did they invite us?
- Gherardini has a reason

164
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,650
- Will there be many guests?
- I suppose so

165
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:18,460
Millionaires collect intellectuals;
he's picked you

166
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,880
A new dress?

167
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,660
Let's not go to Gherardini's party

168
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:04,200
I'd rather we went somewhere
by ourselves

169
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,870
If you like

170
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,040
What's up?

171
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:54,280
- Watching you amuses me
- What's so amusing?

172
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,690
I don't know. Sometimes you seem
to present a front to me

173
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,160
Nonsense. Look at her; she's not bad

174
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,270
Remember?

175
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:01,610
You're really trying to
distract my attention

176
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:07,850
Don't belittle me always.
I can have my own thoughts

177
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,620
What now?

178
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:15,360
I haven't a thought now...
but I'm expecting one

179
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,060
I can feel it coming

180
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:25,330
Here

181
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,620
Did the thought come?

182
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:19,450
Is it a nice thought? Tell me

183
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,660
Why not?

184
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,400
Where's Gherardini's villa?

185
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:35,640
In Brianza; about half an hour's drive

186
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:50,640
Life would be tolerably agreeable
if it were not for its amusements

187
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,350
An inspiration?

188
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,120
I no longer have inspirations,
only recollections

189
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,350
Won't you tell me your thought?

190
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:04,190
Later. Well, shall we go to
the Gherardinis?

191
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,990
Why have you changed your mind?

192
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:10,800
I don't know; one must do something

193
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:49,640
- Are they all dead?
- Let's hope so

194
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:48,630
Who here would read
"The Sleepwalkers"?

195
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,940
Pontano, isn't it? So nice of you to
come. I've heard so much about you

196
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:05,610
We're celebrating the horse's
first victory

197
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,650
My daughter's horse

198
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,150
- What's his name?
- Volfango. He's so good

199
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:17,490
From your books I expected you to be
old and grey

200
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,330
You've read them?

201
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,830
Do I look too inane?
Come, I'll introduce you

202
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:28,640
Let us introduce ourselves
as we meet people

203
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,550
Hello, Berenice

204
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,450
Lidia and I have hated each other
from the cradle

205
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,290
Pontano, we meet at last

206
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:02,140
Antonio, put him to bed

207
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:06,610
- No, he's so sweet
- Not if he doesn't sleep

208
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,640
But it's his party, after all

209
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:16,650
Put him to bed. This lot will
teach him bad habits

210
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:35,440
Don't stare so; I know I show signs
of wear and tear

211
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,510
You've improved a lot, you know

212
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:44,450
You were so plain. Shouldn't I
have said that?

213
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,450
I've heard it many times

214
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:51,650
You behave like a tart

215
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,520
Are you married?

216
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:01,130
I live all alone. I was born to be alone

217
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,900
I'm too sensitive - as my dentist
used to say

218
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,210
Do you still hang around
with intellectuals?

219
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:14,610
I never see you anywhere

220
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:21,280
We don't go out much.
Tonight is an exception

221
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:25,450
How beautiful the pool looks

222
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:31,360
Remember Grimaldi? I still see her

223
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:35,660
Please... let's forget the past

224
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:01,520
There are three thousand roses here;
what a hue they take on at night

225
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:07,460
- Do roses sleep?
- Yes, all night long

226
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:27,650
Isn't that a beauty? It just awoke

227
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:34,960
Tell Filippo to arrange them;
everyone else makes them look funereal

228
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,030
Look who's arrived

229
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,970
- Haven't we met before?
- Yes, but I can't place it

230
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,340
Aren't you enjoying yourself?

231
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,980
- Should I jump into the pool?
- Naked or dressed?

232
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,350
I've heard so many good things
about you

233
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,150
- Who designed this place?
- Vietti

234
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:08,120
Cesarino! Show this gentleman around

235
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:19,930
I'm going to Sweden.
On my boat, of course

236
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:29,410
He's awfully rich; he owes millions

237
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:36,320
Roberto's just arrived.
Shall I introduce you?

238
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,960
He's a remarkable man.
I'll go and get him

239
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:57,240
Stop sending me postcards;
I'm green with envy

240
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:03,180
- I've only just got back
- From your holiday?

241
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:06,450
- It was a business trip
- I bet!

242
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:18,950
Why, Marchesa Gentili, from Rome

243
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:24,160
This lady does so much for orphanages,
Signor Pontano

244
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:31,930
I will have one. Everyone smokes
here in Milan

245
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:37,240
Signorina Resy. Please join us

246
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:43,080
Giovanni Pontano? The author
of that great book?

247
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:49,320
One of the best books ever written

248
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:56,920
I adore it, I really do. I'm your
greatest admirer in Italy

249
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:01,930
You must allow me that privilege

250
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:08,770
I'd like a novel about a woman
who loves a man...

251
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,810
...but the man doesn't love her

252
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,340
But he does admire her intelligence,
her character

253
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:20,480
They live together... but how could
such a story end?

254
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:22,620
In so many ways

255
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:26,890
She'd have to be strong
and sacrifice herself

256
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:31,030
She sacrifices herself for
another woman's happiness

257
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,430
Why does she sacrifice herself?

258
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:37,160
I don't know. It makes me want to cry

259
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:04,890
What are you doing here?
Why not mix with the others?

260
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:08,500
Yes, I will in a moment

261
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,330
Do you find it interesting here?

262
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:18,110
So-so. Why is it you never seem
to enjoy yourself?

263
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,410
I am enjoying myself

264
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:24,040
There's a girl in there enjoying
herself alone, too

265
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,710
She's the one reading
"The Sleepwalkers"

266
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,420
She's pretty, too

267
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:49,500
- Everything all right, Pontano?
- I'm afraid I know no one

268
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:18,970
It's absurd to condemn wealth.
No one's wealthy now

269
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,640
But if anyone is still thinking of
becoming rich...

270
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:27,170
...my advice is: don't let money
obsess you

271
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:32,180
I've always looked upon my businesses
as works of art

272
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:36,780
Their financial profit was
almost immaterial

273
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:42,090
The important thing is to create
something lasting

274
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:46,390
But not everyone can create
something lasting

275
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:53,630
The thing that sustains a writer,
like you, Pontano...

276
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:58,110
...is a sense of necessity,
not a need for profit

277
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,580
You write because it's necessary
for you and others

278
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:06,850
- But one has to live
- I never worried about that

279
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,220
Life is what you make of it
with your own resources

280
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:14,760
What would you do if you
couldn't write?

281
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:18,790
I think he'd commit suicide

282
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,900
I don't feel that important

283
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,930
Perhaps there are other ways

284
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:32,940
Isn't writing an irrepressible
but antiquated instinct?

285
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:40,350
A lonely craftsman putting
one word after another

286
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,780
The job can't be mechanized

287
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:45,790
Do you believe all that?

288
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:49,960
No. But you have the advantage
of real people...

289
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:54,230
...you create real houses, real cities

290
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:00,030
The rhythm of life, the future,
is in your hands

291
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:03,570
This is a black day for my husband

292
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,110
You're right

293
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:09,110
Are you one of the many
worrying about the future?

294
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:13,910
I'm building my own, although
the present keeps me busy

295
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:18,550
Probably the future will never come

296
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:22,290
The future will be awful,
don't you think?

297
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,960
By the way, why not stay here tonight?

298
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:28,260
Darling, you're always interrupting me

299
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:34,740
Carry on. You were saying the future
may never come

300
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,950
Who knows what the future holds?

301
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:50,890
Our privileges will vanish.
A good thing, too

302
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:56,620
When I was young I imagined
a world like this...

303
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:00,930
...and set out to create such a future

304
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,940
Would you like a drink?

305
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:18,780
He's been staring at that statue
all night

306
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:23,180
Who knows what the animal is thinking?
Maybe he expects it to wake up

307
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:26,250
Cats are strange

308
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,570
Go away, Resy. Leave me alone

309
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,820
Can't you find someone
to play with me?

310
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:07,150
- Won't I do?
- No. Too old

311
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,930
- I'll be younger if I play with you
- I don't want that

312
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:23,940
I'd have won. The compact
must stop on the last row

313
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:26,810
What's the prize?

314
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,580
You make a wish and tell it
if you win

315
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:32,650
My name is Valentina

316
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,920
Do you often lose this game?

317
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:36,920
I've just invented it

318
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:40,320
- Once I lost everything
- What game was that?

319
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:46,330
The first with seven points
is the winner

320
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:50,760
Frankly, I came here to talk to you

321
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,910
Too ruthless

322
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:11,090
I'm scared

323
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:21,930
That was not ruthless enough

324
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,310
One for me

325
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,930
One of the stones has fallen out

326
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:00,940
It can't have gone far, can it?

327
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,910
Maybe it rolled into the garden

328
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,080
Never mind, it was only a ruby

329
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:20,920
Do you enjoy acting the cynic?

330
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,940
Fifteen thousand on Valentina

331
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,910
Twenty thousand on Pontano

332
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:49,720
- Sixty thousand on Pontano
- Come, now, you can't be serious

333
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:57,060
You only worry about losers

334
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:01,730
A typical intellectual.
Egoistic, but compassionate

335
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:07,100
This isn't a racetrack and don't
take me for a horse

336
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,940
Is there a friskier horse?

337
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:14,100
I wish to enquire about Signor Garani.
Room 103

338
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:20,340
When?

339
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,410
Ten minutes ago?

340
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:28,320
Was his mother with him?

341
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:33,160
I'm rather disappointed

342
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:37,930
In me?

343
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:41,800
How can I put that right?

344
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:46,240
Shall we read a few pages together?

345
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:50,080
That would be one way of
becoming closer

346
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:55,920
- Are you craving affection?
- Aren't you?

347
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:02,260
I withdrew from the game;
you must claim your prize

348
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:07,460
Let me savour it a little longer

349
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:12,370
But don't forget

350
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,940
My memory seems to get worse
every day

351
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:09,980
Good night, Daddy

352
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:14,420
I'd like a word

353
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:40,930
Pontano, I've got a proposition for you.
I could use a man like you

354
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,800
I'm running a cultural programme
for my employees

355
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:51,910
I want better contact between
workers and management

356
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:57,710
You know why?

357
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:03,250
They don't know the firm's history
and my part in it

358
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:13,430
I want a press and public relations
department...

359
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:16,570
...with a special section...

360
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,940
...devoted to internal relations

361
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:27,610
- I want our company's history written
- By me?

362
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,580
Yes, but as an executive

363
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:35,190
- A full-time job?
- That's right

364
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:40,120
Wouldn't you like an executive position?
May I ask what you earn?

365
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,730
Your wife's family is rich, I believe

366
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:53,240
True, but I have my own money, and
I contribute to many publications

367
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,320
Wouldn't you like to be independent?

368
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:12,190
In what way?

369
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:18,930
Think it over. It's our policy
to pay top salaries

370
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:38,880
Look what my cousin brought me
from America

371
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:42,180
A wallet, with a dollar inside

372
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:44,890
You see, the dollar gets everywhere

373
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:49,260
All alone, Signora Pontano?

374
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:19,620
Isn't it beautiful here?

375
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:53,560
- Where are you going?
- I won't be long

376
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:50,740
Have you seen Signorina Gherardini?

377
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,740
Shall we dance?

378
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:02,250
You can't dance

379
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,940
Don't play about

380
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:55,930
Where are we going?

381
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:30,190
Wait a moment. Let's talk.
Tell me something

382
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:34,430
I'll tell you a bedtime story later

383
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,200
Pretend I'm in bed

384
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:42,940
No, later. I'll tell you about a
hermit - intellectual, of course

385
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,810
He drank only dew, until
he came to the city...

386
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,450
...tasted wine and become an
alcoholic. How's that?

387
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,480
I'd like a true story about you

388
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:59,920
- Worse has happened to me
- I wish I could understand a writer

389
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:05,460
- I've forgotten your name
- Friends call me Resy

390
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:10,560
- You want to understand writers only?
- No, others, too

391
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:14,940
I think you'll have your hands full

392
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:29,890
I'm sorry, I can't

393
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:11,900
At least I'm clever enough
not to break up a marriage

394
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:23,380
Now spend the rest of the evening
with your wife

395
01:29:23,410 --> 01:29:26,580
But it was she who sent me to you

396
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:30,680
Never mind. It's my prize of your game

397
01:29:31,550 --> 01:29:35,890
It's so dark. How can I find her?

398
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:55,870
I felt miserable this evening...

399
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:59,880
...but our game cheered me up

400
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:09,890
Now the misery is creeping back,
like a melancholy dog

401
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:32,840
- Have you got a cigarette?
- No, I smoke cigars

402
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,880
I'll get my own

403
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:07,210
Bring more candles

404
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:18,990
I think we still have
some things to say

405
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,260
Of course

406
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:37,340
I think that love restricts a person

407
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:41,850
It creates misunderstanding all around

408
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:46,690
But not within. Even novels are
sentimental now

409
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:51,060
I see; you're gathering material tonight

410
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:54,890
The way I feel, I don't know
if I'll ever write again

411
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:59,530
I know what to write,
but not how to write it

412
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:05,740
It's called a crisis; very common
among writers today

413
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:09,810
But in my case it's affecting
my whole life

414
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:15,510
You're just weak, like me

415
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:26,360
Why tell me? I may not understand

416
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:32,430
My hobbies are golf, tennis...

417
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:36,270
...cars and parties

418
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:44,010
Is that all in life? Don't you like
other things, too?

419
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:47,510
Yes. Everything

420
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:06,740
Promise not to make fun of me?

421
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:16,290
I heard snatches of television
dialogue:

422
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:21,930
"Stop that car!"
"I wouldn't do that, Jim"

423
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:26,560
After that, the howling of a dog...

424
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:31,940
...rising effortlessly,
in perfect misery

425
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,770
Then I thought I heard a 'plane

426
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:39,910
Then silence... and I was happy

427
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:46,220
A garden's silence is made of sounds;
press your ear to a tree and listen

428
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:52,490
The sounds may be within us;
I'd rather think it's the tree

429
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:56,130
The silence is broken by
an alien noise...

430
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:59,630
...disturbing my peace

431
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:06,140
I close the window, but the noise
persists; it's too much for me

432
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:11,370
I don't want useless sounds;
I want to select them

433
01:34:11,410 --> 01:34:16,580
Voices and words... there are so many
words I'd rather not hear...

434
01:34:16,610 --> 01:34:21,920
...but you must resign yourself, like
floating on the waves of the sea

435
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:31,390
May I hear it again?

436
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:05,930
I've erased it. It was drivel.
I don't take my writing very seriously

437
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:11,200
Mother says scribbling indoors
ruins the complexion

438
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:13,300
It's a sin to waste such intelligence

439
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:16,640
I'm not intelligent; I'm alert

440
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:21,910
I'm happy to observe things
without having to write

441
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:25,280
I went to the States to see Julia

442
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,320
- Who's Julia?
- A hurricane

443
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:43,930
We may meet more often, Valentina.
Your father has offered me a job

444
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,470
Last year I thought I was
in love with a boy...

445
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:54,950
Something must be wrong with me,
but it will pass

446
01:35:55,410 --> 01:36:01,550
Whenever I try to communicate...
love disappears

447
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:06,890
Was that when you lost everything?

448
01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:14,130
Why work for my father?
Surely you don't need money

449
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,170
No?

450
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:26,410
What you need is a girl,
for a fresh start

451
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,680
Not a girl

452
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:33,920
You

453
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:41,930
- Don't be afraid
- I'm not

454
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:56,170
You see? It's ridiculous

455
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:07,880
How can he sleep? Anything might
happen

456
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:13,160
- Nothing ever happens
- Yes, but I hate seeing time wasted

457
01:37:17,230 --> 01:37:20,560
You'll give me a heart attack

458
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:41,420
Come to my room and dry yourself

459
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:51,730
How prosaic. Sandwiches at this hour

460
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:56,730
d'Annunzio's turtle died of colic
after eating flowers

461
01:37:57,070 --> 01:38:00,570
It's true, but you don't believe me

462
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:04,940
I'll get a towel

463
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,120
You should take your dress off

464
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:23,160
Listen, Valentina... isn't that
your name?

465
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:27,760
Stop fussing over me; tell me
what you have in mind?

466
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:31,840
Please don't spare my feelings

467
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:37,270
I'm sure that's not in your nature

468
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:42,310
I've nothing in mind. Dry yourself or
stay wet, but don't go on about it

469
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:58,930
Isn't our writer drinking?

470
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,430
One day, in Venice...

471
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:06,100
...I was dining with that
American author...

472
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:09,340
- The one who hunts elephants
- Hemingway?

473
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:13,640
There's a man for you. A real artist

474
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:18,110
I said to him: "Dear Hemingway,
I like you

475
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:22,720
"One of these days I'll visit you
in Cuba"

476
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:28,560
Do you know what he replied?
"If you do, I'll shoot you"

477
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:33,800
There's a man who knows his business

478
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:37,930
Earns what he likes.
Millions of dollars

479
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:42,110
Even an intellectual can't scorn that

480
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:45,740
It's hard to say what an intellectual
might scorn

481
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:49,450
My boy, never despise money

482
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:51,080
Our time, sir...

483
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:57,490
...is vile and anti-philosophical,
afraid to take a stand on values

484
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:04,430
As for democracy, in a nutshell,
it means: take things as they come

485
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:08,730
I respect that quotation,
but it's offensive here

486
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:14,240
He spoke it complacently,
but in despair

487
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:18,410
It's the words that count,
not the author's intentions

488
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:25,420
- Shall I tell you what happened?
- Skip it

489
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:30,920
Fine. I'm not much good at confessions

490
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:37,930
I wonder what I am good at?
Not a love, it escapes me

491
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:44,330
I've plenty of vices,
but I hardly practise them

492
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,940
I don't even like whisky

493
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:56,910
I think I've found the vice that
suits me; it's warm and good

494
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:04,920
How old are you?

495
01:41:06,090 --> 01:41:11,190
Eighteen... plus many, many months

496
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:36,720
You don't know what it is to feel
the weight of years, in vain

497
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:45,730
I just feel like dying

498
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:51,270
An end to this agony, something new

499
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:56,340
- It may be nothing
- Yes, it may be nothing

500
01:41:58,580 --> 01:41:59,940
Let's go

501
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:13,160
I don't feel a bit jealous,
in spite of what I said

502
01:42:14,090 --> 01:42:16,390
Not a bit

503
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,500
That's the trouble

504
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,940
I hope we'll see you again

505
01:42:30,410 --> 01:42:36,950
- Perhaps you'll invite me over?
- In September, after your holiday

506
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:48,020
This year I won't be back until later...
much later

507
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:28,000
You've exhausted me, the pair of you

508
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,900
Shall we go this way?

509
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:16,340
Take no notice. I'm just crying
because I'm silly

510
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,820
Let's not go home just yet

511
01:45:54,910 --> 01:46:00,920
Want to hear a good one?
Gherardini offered me a job

512
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:04,790
- Will you accept it?
- I don't think so

513
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:11,560
Why not? It's a good opportunity.
Your life would be your own at last

514
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:51,800
I 'phoned the clinic. Tommaso is dead

515
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:54,970
When? Why didn't you tell me?

516
01:46:55,010 --> 01:47:00,580
You were playing. Was he really
your good friend?

517
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:05,780
He was much more to me

518
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:11,920
He convinced me, despite myself,
that I was more clever than I am

519
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:23,730
He spent days trying to make me study...

520
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:29,940
...even though I wasn't interested;
I was concerned with my problems

521
01:47:31,610 --> 01:47:35,180
His persistence nearly drove me mad

522
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:40,920
I began to hate him for it

523
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:48,930
He never talked about himself.
Only me... me...

524
01:47:50,090 --> 01:47:53,100
And I never understood

525
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,930
I thought so little of myself

526
01:47:57,400 --> 01:48:03,940
When we're young, we're so stupid, we
can't imagine things coming to an end

527
01:48:06,910 --> 01:48:10,310
You talked only about yourself

528
01:48:11,010 --> 01:48:15,920
That was something new for me,
I was so happy with it...

529
01:48:16,150 --> 01:48:20,190
...that nothing in the world
was more beautiful

530
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:25,030
Because I loved you. You, not him

531
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:32,570
That's why his affection irritated me
and flattered you

532
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,210
Isn't that true?

533
01:48:39,610 --> 01:48:44,310
Yes, but not much.
He was so vulnerable.

534
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:04,260
I feel like dying because
I no longer love you

535
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:07,930
That's why I'm desperate

536
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:14,510
I wish I were old, my life's
dedication to you over

537
01:49:15,410 --> 01:49:20,080
I wish I no longer existed,
because I can't love you

538
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:27,950
That's the thought which came to me...

539
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:31,920
...in the night club,
when you were so bored

540
01:49:33,230 --> 01:49:37,960
But if this is true,
if you feel like dying...

541
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,100
...it means you still love me

542
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:45,570
No, it's only pity

543
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:14,570
I never gave you anything.
I was completely unaware

544
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:19,640
I go on wasting my life, like a fool...

545
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:23,940
...taking without giving,
or giving too little

546
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:29,410
If you mean I haven't much to give,
you may be right

547
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:35,250
I used to spend afternoons
reading in bed

548
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:38,960
Tommaso would call and find me there

549
01:50:38,990 --> 01:50:45,400
He could have taken me; I wouldn't
have resisted, out of boredom

550
01:50:46,330 --> 01:50:51,940
But he was satisfied to watch me
as I read

551
01:50:52,170 --> 01:50:55,740
All those purposeless books

552
01:50:56,410 --> 01:51:00,750
Two hundred pages a day;
I read so quickly

553
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:06,590
I've been selfish

554
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:12,420
Now I realize that what we give others
comes back to us

555
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:21,330
Do they think their music
will improve the day?

556
01:51:22,170 --> 01:51:25,370
Lidia, let's settle this

557
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:29,240
Let's try to hang on to something
we're sure of

558
01:51:30,410 --> 01:51:32,710
I love you

559
01:51:32,910 --> 01:51:38,920
I'm sure I'm still in love with you.
What more can I say? Let's go home

560
01:51:49,090 --> 01:51:52,960
When I awoke this morning
you were still asleep

561
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:58,340
As I awoke I heard
your gentle breathing

562
01:51:58,470 --> 01:52:04,240
I saw your closed eyes,
beneath wisps of stray hair...

563
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:07,480
...and I was deeply moved

564
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:13,920
I wanted to cry out, to wake you,
but you slept so deeply, so soundly

565
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:20,160
In the half light your skin
glowed with life...

566
01:52:20,190 --> 01:52:26,930
...so warm and sweet I wanted to kiss
it, but I was afraid to wake you

567
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:31,840
I was afraid of you awake
in my arms again

568
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:38,810
Instead, I wanted something no one
could take from me, mine alone...

569
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:41,650
...this eternal image of you

570
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:46,720
Beyond your face I saw
a pure, beautiful vision...

571
01:52:46,750 --> 01:52:52,190
...showing us in the perspective
of my whole life...

572
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:58,660
...all the years to come,
even all the years past

573
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:01,800
That was the most miraculous thing:

574
01:53:01,830 --> 01:53:06,370
to feel, for the first time,
that you had always been mine

575
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:10,210
That this night would go on
for ever...

576
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:15,910
...united with your warmth,
your thought, your will

577
01:53:16,850 --> 01:53:21,390
At that moment I realized
how much I loved you, Lidia

578
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:25,560
I wept with the intensity of
the emotion

579
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:30,430
For I felt that this must never
end...

580
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:34,370
...we would remain like this
all our lives...

581
01:53:35,230 --> 01:53:39,940
...not only close, but
belonging to each other...

582
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:44,640
...in a way that nothing could
ever destroy...

583
01:53:44,680 --> 01:53:50,920
...except the apathy of habit,
the only threat

584
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:57,790
Then you wakened and, smiling, put
your arms around me, kissed me...

585
01:53:57,820 --> 01:54:00,790
...and I felt there was nothing
to fear

586
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:04,430
We would always be as we were
of that moment...

587
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:08,300
...bound by stronger ties
than time and habit

588
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:16,810
Who wrote that?

589
01:54:21,610 --> 01:54:23,650
You did

590
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:04,720
No... I don't love you any more

591
01:55:06,590 --> 01:55:10,500
You don't love me, either

592
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:19,040
Say it

593
01:55:19,070 --> 01:55:22,710
No, I won't say it
