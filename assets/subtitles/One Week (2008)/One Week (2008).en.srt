7,300 --> 00:00:30,550
What would you do, if you knew you only have one day

2
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,100
or one week, or one month to live.

3
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,645
I am afraid that it's not a great news.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,694
We have picked up cancar cells in

5
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,900
your blood, your liver and your lymph nodes.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,675
We need to get the treatment right away

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,800
How bad is it?

8
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,540
It's stage four.

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,905
How many stages are there?

10
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Four.

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,555
Here are the first three unfiltered thoughts

12
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:16,630
that went through Ben's head.

13
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,400
He was calling off the wedding.

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,665
Relief because he can use this as an excuse

15
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:23,169
to get out of marking

16
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:25,950
six classes of English exams.

17
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,800
How many people would come to his funeral.

18
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,900
The fourth thought, he voiced aloud

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,050
Are you sure you have made some kind of mistake?

20
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,760
You know, I feel fine.

21
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,860
We are sure.

22
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,600
So, what are you saying here?

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,450
You have a unextremely aggressive form of cancer.

24
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,120
You need an aggressive treatment.

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,750
What about my chances?

26
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,485
I got a scale of 1-10.

27
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,625
The survival rate is about 10%.

28
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,700
I am gonna die?

29
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,100
When dealing with individual, we through the odds out. 

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,555
In some cases, a complete recovery is unheared of.

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,360
And if the treatments do not work, how long do I have?

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
A couple of years.

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
At mimimum?

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,580
So, what is the minimum?

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
There isn't one.

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,855
- You are right, son?  - Yeah.

37
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,995
I'm ok, thanks.

38
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
You ride?

39
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,905
No, for a couple of years.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,320
I expect it would be sold.

41
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,715
My... eyes had gone. I couldn't get my license renewed.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,800
I would never really believe that you have old bones.

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,400
I tell ya, it's a blink from diversity depense.

44
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,450
Take for a ride?

45
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,050
No, thanks. I am not in the market for a bike.

46
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,275
Of course you not.

47
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,950
One might conclude that the opportunity to buy a motorcycle

48
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,050
so soon after hearing Ben's cataclysmic news,

49
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,050
might be divine and intervention.

50
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,400
That would be erroneous.

51
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,400
In fact, Ben has been circling around the purchaser for a while.

52
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,700
But before we proceed further, a bit of the back story.

53
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,550
Gerald Benjamin Tyler was born on January 14th 1979 in Toronto, Canada. 

54
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,581
Temperature was unseasonablly

55
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:34,600
-19 degree Celslius.

56
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,995
It has been 12 years since the Lives 

57
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:39,800
had last won Stanley Cup.

58
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,100
So, what would Ben's life changing moments?

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,000
All I want to see out there today is a hansel. 

60
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,400
Keep your eyes on the ball.

61
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Tyler!

62
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,355
Perhaps, maybe if you stop sticking your finger up your nose every two minutes,

63
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:59,110
you might actually catch the ball.

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,118
Never again would Ben be caught 

65
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,810
picking his nose in public.

66
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,350
and never again would he be caught daydreaming.

67
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,455
The two acts seem to go hand in hand

68
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:10,530
or finger in nose, if you will.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,605
The second seismic event.

70
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:14,752
Ben's parents have brought Ben 

71
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:18,200
into believing he had the voice of an angel.

72
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,270
However the dream died during the auditions 

73
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,800
for the school production of H.M.S. Pinafore.

74
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,995
He is an Englishman.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,305
Enough! Enough!

76
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:31,500
Stop before you make my ears bleed.

77
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,300
It was dreadful!

78
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,550
Ben never sang in public again.

79
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,100
However, Mrs. Bell's derogatory remarks

80
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,550
were intended as an act of revenge. 

81
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,900
Bell's big butt.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,710
The third event. Ben's first novel. 

83
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,080
A thinly weird autobiography failed to find a publishing home.

84
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,700
He had created an orphan.

85
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,905
How different things might have been for Ben.

86
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:06,350
Had his nose-picking and daydreaming been able to continue?

87
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,000
Had he believed praise when he heard? 

88
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,135
And had he decided to against all hope

89
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:14,810
to send his manuscript to HarperCollins

90
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,260
for there had recently hired a young editor

91
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,499
who was on the power for the just type of

92
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,084
literary offering that Ben had produced.

93
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,555
Five minutes left, everybody.

94
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,950
Ben taught the same books that he had been taught.

95
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,100
that his father had been taught

96
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,399
that all likelihood

97
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:38,400
Shakespeare's father had been taught  

98
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,874
It wouldn't be entirly untrue to suggest

99
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:44,200
that the teaching profession was not Ben's passion.

100
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,100
The one on rare occasions he did steal swing for the fancies.

101
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,500
'Tho' much is taken, much abides

102
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,850
'and tho' we are not now that strength which in the old days
104 

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,950
'moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are

104
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,805
'one equal-temper of heroic hearts,

105
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:13,950
'made weak by time and fate, but strong in will

106
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,100
'to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,200
Ben was set to marry Samantha Pierce.

108
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,785
The wedding was planned for three mouths from now.

109
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Hey, it that yours?

110
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,700
I was beginning to think that he's never going to ask me.

111
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,005
We all were, dear, we all were.

112
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:05,050
You did the right thing, son.

113
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,275
I am proud of you.

114
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,105
I know what you are thinking. 

115
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:15,350
Ben settled for a career and now was going to settle for a wife.

116
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,505
But before you go too far with that theory,

117
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:21,400
You should know five things that Ben adores about Samantha.

118
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,750
Her left hip bum.

119
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,900
Not does there's anything wrong with the right,

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,550
but the left is a perfection.

121
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,750
The playlists.

122
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,402
Samantha became the factual

123
00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:36,350
DJ to the soundtrack of Ben's life.

124
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,550
Her parents

125
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,700
Mary Jo and Tom are the nicest people anyone could ever meet.

126
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,753
Her underrated ability 

127
00:08:42,853 --> 00:08:44,375
to provide obscure

128
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:47,100
but yet surprisingly pergnant quotations

129
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,685
that always revealed a larger truth. 

130
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,450
Samantha became a golf fan

131
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,550
just because she knew Ben loved the sport.

132
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,600
His fiancee developed an interest even in taping the delayed sinous events from the 

133
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,800
Asian tour.

134
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,900
If that is not love, what is? 

135
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,450
Though Samantha wasn't the demanding sort,

136
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,300
she was eminent about one thing,

137
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,865
she hated motorcycles.

138
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,240
As an act she worried, driving a motorcycle

139
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,015
represents the height of stupidity.

140
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,100
So?

141
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,450
I'll take it.

142
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,550
I am not surprised.

143
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,645
The price is not negotiable.

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
OK.

145
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,450
Hell, I give you a tip of seven.

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You really don't have to.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,200
No, I insist.

148
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
What do you find while you are riding?

149
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
I don't know yet.

150
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,555
Upon hearing the news of his cancer,

151
00:10:16,655 --> 00:10:20,500
Ben's plan has been to go to the home to tell Samantha about his prognosis

152
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,300
and hopefully make desperate love to her

153
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,200
all night long.

154
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,295
First, he needed a coffee.

155
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,650
Because he still had a trace of dreamer left in him.

156
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,655
Ben always rolled up the rim the to see if he won.

157
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:49,775
Go west young man

158
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,735
Ben decided to wait until after his father's birthday party 

159
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:22,900
to break the news to Samantha. 

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,995
She would not be able to be hid the secret

161
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,500
- Can I make a toast?  - Oh, my God.

162
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,830
Can you just send us an e-mail?

163
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,000
Sure, I just want to say... no.

164
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,000
I wanna admit that despite my growing decrepitude,

165
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,905
I have never been happier

166
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,150
I have somehow...

167
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,800
hold of very lucky life

168
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,300
And I would like to make a toast to my family.

169
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Thank you all.

170
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,050
Cheers.

171
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,150
Cheers, Dad.

172
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,980
We will not cancel the wedding.

173
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,500
Not after all the work have put into it,

174
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,700
unless you want to.

175
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,700
No! I don't care about the wedding.

176
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,000
I... I care about the insanity of you going on vacation.

177
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,100
The longer you put off getting treatment, the worse the odds get.

178
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,400
I'm not going on vacation.

179
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,655
The second I step into the hospital, they gonna to nick upon me with drugs so powerful. 

180
00:12:45,755 --> 00:12:48,052
It's gonna to feel like I'm getting glass shards. 

181
00:12:48,152 --> 00:12:51,100
shut down my throat every time I swallow.

182
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,050
Before I become a patient, I need to do this.

183
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,100
You need to do what, exactly?

184
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,665
I need to have an adventure.

185
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,325
If this was me, I would be signing up for every treatment on the planet.

186
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,535
I would drink goat piss if I thought that would make it difference.

187
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:11,500
I know you would, Sam, but it's only for two days.

188
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,500
And when I get back, I am in the treatment, 100%, I promise.

189
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,355
It is incomprehensible to me that you would wait

190
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:20,600
But it is not incomprehensible to me

191
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,950
- I... I just need  - What?

192
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,850
Come with me.

193
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Just come with me.

194
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,775
No, I would be too angry if you hold the time.

195
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,550
What about your family?

196
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,905
I'll tell my family when I get back.

197
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:11,685
Ben insisted that the wedding would go ahead as planned. 

198
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,300
Because Ben missed his appointment,

199
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,460
nurse Forrester was able to leave work 

200
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,600
12 minutes earlier than usual.

201
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,979
In a burst of power walking proudest,

202
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,700
she just managed to catch the 17:45 train
205  

203
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,050
had geared not in a quite a stricken 

204
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,550
she would have been one of 13 casualties on the 18:10 train.

205
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,410
the derail just outside the Etobicoke.

206
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,400
Ben in fact toyed.

207
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,430
Without irony, he loved these old  marshals to the world biggest.  

208
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,255
Part of the pleasure was inventing entire back stories 

209
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:48,300
about how these creations came into being. 

210
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,500
"And I say what our town needs is something to put on the map.

211
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,405
Something with a big time of 'wow' factor.

212
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,250
The world's largest Photomosaic."

213
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,392
Ben remembered reading 

214
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:23,005
about a man in Britain,

215
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:24,591
John Brandrick actually, who 

216
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:26,800
was diagnosed with pancreas cancer 

217
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,750
And it was given a year to live

218
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,550
He spent everything he had,

219
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,950
only to find out that it was a misdiagnosis

220
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,685
And he would be fine.

221
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,510
What if Ben was misdiagnosed? 

222
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,100
Samantha was right.

223
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,600
He was swimming in that famous river in Egypt.

224
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,110
He would go home.

225
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,150
Hey, buddy.

226
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,700
You know if there's any Canadian Tire pretty sound?

227
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,650
No. Sorry, no idea.

228
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,900
We will lose the bet if we walk to Sudbury.

229
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,600
So important to find a Canadian Tire here?

230
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,505
Our buddy Gurvy bet a bus of beer.

231
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:57,250
- Each.  - Each , that if we could ride

232
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,795
From Newfoundland to Vancouver, under six weeks 

233
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:01,780
And spend less than $ 400, so

234
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,850
Every time we have a bike down, what happens more than you think.

235
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:10,070
We simply ride to the nearest store to replace one bike for another.

236
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,388
Come on, there's no way that you ride a

237
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:13,600
bike all this way to the West

238
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,150
Why not?

239
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,300
You do not have any of the proper equipment.

240
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,180
Besides the bloody headwind, there hasn't been any problems so far.

241
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,600
Look, I'll give one of you guys a ride across the town for a check?

242
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,600
Sorry, we can not accept rides or we'll lose the bet. It's the rule number 6.

243
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,200
Again shit face to agree to that one.

244
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,800
See you later.

245
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Best luck.

246
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,862
In comparison to the sheer lunacy into cycling 

247
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:57,335
to the headwind to cross the country for

248
00:19:57,435 --> 00:19:59,435
a case of beer,

249
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,765
Ben recommited to heading West.

250
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,750
Hi.

251
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,050
Are you pregnant?

252
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,550
I mean, I mean, are we pregnant?

253
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,400
No, of course not.

254
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,900
Why did you write a note about our... our kids?

255
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,600
Bacause I was pulling you a heart string.

256
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,455
I was throwing Ave Maria for past few months    

257
00:21:18,555 --> 00:21:21,500
the thought of our unborn children make you come home sooner.

258
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,500
But definitely you are not pregnant?

259
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,900
No.

260
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,505
No, and if I wasn't trusted I wouldn't tell you in code.

261
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,140
"What should we do? "...

262
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,940
"We should keep looking for Grumps" ...

263
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,270
"So they searched all day

264
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,060
But could not find any signs of Grumps"...

265
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,940
Ben's father, a rather persuasive story teller had his son

266
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:32,550
ardently convinced of the existence of Grumps.

267
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,700
A mythical creature so illusive

268
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,900
But to actually see one would bring untold good fortune.

269
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,677
At what point in his childhood did reason 

270
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:58,000
trump in imagination and            

271
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,550
Ben had concluded that the world was Grumpless? 

272
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,600
Ben had a overwhelming urge to embrace of randomness

273
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,440
And resumed the quest for Grumps.

274
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,100
I need to know if you have any objections to a church wedding.

275
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
No. Of course not.

276
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,700
And is there anything you would like to incorporate into the wedding?

277
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
No.

278
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,615
Can I ask you a question, Ben?

279
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,720
Um... do you have any beliefs?

280
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,570
How can you not believe in anything?

281
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,750
We had a kids discussion. We had the financial discussion

282
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,501
How could we not have a religious discussion?

283
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:13,001
You can't be honestly that upset about this, can you?     

284
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,650
I'm marrying a nihilist.

285
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,827
For Samantha's sake, Ben

286
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:27,942
Tried very hard to listen for God. 

287
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,616
However, he could never seem to 

288
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:46,966
tune in to proper divine frequency.   

289
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,950
Hi.

290
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:01,050
Look, um...

291
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,100
When you said that you couldn't believe you are marrying a nihilist

292
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Were you being insufficient?               

293
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,100
No.

294
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,495
But I'm OK with this.

295
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,200
Just tell me when you're coming home.

296
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,350
That's pretty a major compromise, isn't it?

297
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,450
No, it's a minor compromise.

298
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,270
I resigned myself to the fact we don't see eye to eye on faith.

299
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,525
Where are you?

300
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:25,150
Are there anything more you think you compromised on?

301
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,905
Yes, this is pretty be in the relationship.

302
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,600
Well.. like what? Just, you know, an example.

303
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,300
Why are you even talking about this?

304
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,650
I was able to reschedule our commitment on Monday.    

305
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,655
I was just a little wondering maybe one of the things you compromised on 

306
00:26:41,755 --> 00:26:45,900
is, in fact, one of things I like most about myself.

307
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,400
There's nothing major, honestly.

308
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,260
That's great. Maybe just a minor example then.

309
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
OK.

310
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,965
Um... I wish you didn't have foot odor.  

311
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,050
But I don't have a foot odor.

312
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,800
This is a ridiculous conversation. Forget about it.

313
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,900
It is ridiculous, because you tell me that my feet stink but my feet don't stink.

314
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,005
Well, maybe you have a little factory of problems as well.

315
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:17,000
I never mentioned that before bacause I knew that you are sensitive about it.

316
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,150
Because it doesn't exist.

317
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Trust me, they reek.           

318
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,810
You can pay for those over there.

319
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,900
Actually I... I... um...

320
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,600
I need to ask you for a favor.

321
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Sure.

322
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,450
Can you tell me if my shoe stinks?

323
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,530
Excuse me?

324
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,505
I know that sounds absurd, but it's really really important to me.

325
00:27:49,605 --> 00:27:53,685
Feel fit to be brutally honest.

326
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,850
Well, in my professional opinion...

327
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,950
it's fine.

328
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,650
Ben wondered about the larger implication that

329
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,550
Samantha's hostility to the alleged foot fault   

330
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,900
The more important consideration

331
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,845
Why didn't Samantha ask him what he didn't like aboout her?

332
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,250
You are the northern?

333
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,350
Yeah.

334
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Where you headed?

335
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,250
West.

336
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,000
Somewhere in the west, in particular? 

337
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,450
Not yet.

338
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,830
So you've got direction, but not...

339
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
destination.

340
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,750
Yes, that's about sums it up.

341
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:33,000
You know that marijuana has been medically approved for cancer patients

342
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,355
What? Some kind of psychic?

343
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,000
No.

344
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,820
But why did you bring up cancer?

345
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,705
I had an asshole followid at once.                

346
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,095
So you got the treatment?

347
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,945
Actually, he wanted a way on it's own.

348
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
Seriously?

349
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,950
I wish ... man.              

350
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,050
I got treatment.

351
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,050
You married?

352
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Engaged.

353
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,850
How about you? Wife?

354
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,900
25 years. Her name was Conny.

355
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,700
Really? What were you for when you got married?  

356
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
17, actually.

357
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,950
You still in love?

358
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah.

359
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,620
How did you know what was the real thing?

360
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,580
If you gotta ask...

361
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
you're not.

362
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
And you already knew that.

363
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,950
That which we are, we are. - Ulysses, Alfred Tennyson

364
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Diana?

365
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,400
This was the farthest west world that Terry had run.

366
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,304
But of course that he never stopped dreaming of getting

367
00:32:42,404 --> 00:32:45,050
back on the road and touching the Pacific.

368
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,855
"All I can say is that if there is any way for me to get back

369
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:50,760
I'll finishwhat I will."               

370
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,700
Hello?

371
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
What are you doing?

372
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,700
I'm trying on my sister's wedding dress.

373
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,435
What happened to the one you have made?

374
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,700
I guess I have to remake that dress

375
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,000
Again?

376
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,100
Yes, again.

377
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,450
Does it grab your boobs funny?

378
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,950
Yeah...

379
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:40,850
Did you have anything to do with your boobs not to the dresses?

380
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You come home.

381
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Please?

382
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,495
I'm not ready yet, Sam

383
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,150
- I... um...  - What are you doing?

384
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,455
Well, I was... just came into the ring to get out of the heat and I...

385
00:37:26,555 --> 00:37:28,840
And... what?

386
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,555
Well, I thought it was having a heatstroke.

387
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:33,800
I mean, not thinking was the real Stanley Cup.

388
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,300
That is the real Stanley Cup, right?

389
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,550
Yes, of course it is.

390
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,650
What are you doing here?

391
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,800
It is Derek Vincent's day in Manitoba since I won the cup.

392
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,600
Expositary fact

393
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,750
Each member of the Stanley Cup champions has the possession of the cup for 24 hours. 

394
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,300
Derek was on the hour 7.

395
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,350
- You are Derek Vincent?  - I am.

396
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,450
Congratulations, man.

397
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,900
Thanks.

398
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,550
Where's the guy for the commercial?

399
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,700
You know, the kind of white gloves the guard with his life.

400
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,850
In fact, I have got a couple of advices to distract.

401
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:13,050
To be a moment only with the cup, you know?

402
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,900
I could never get the... right?            

403
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,400
I left the game halfway through the game with a concussion, so...

404
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,795
Yes, I remember that fight.

405
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,745
Everybody remember that fight, except me

406
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,660
I guess you want me to leave, huh?

407
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,300
No.

408
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,800
True fact. 

409
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,800
Doctors had diagnosed Cheryl O'Reilly as an inferior...

410
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,950
One night, Mike Ricci Colorado Avalanche brought the Cup to a party. 

411
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:50,490
Cheryl kissed it and nine months later, Stanley was born.

412
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,850
You want to kiss the cup?

413
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,950
Hope it brings you good luck.

414
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,900
Yeah.

415
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,000
felt that the ghosts of all the players who have ever kissed the Cup

416
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:40,730
might just be able to body check his cancer into oblivion.

417
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,900
# I saw a beaver, I saw a goose #

418
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,000
# Riding the railroad with a two four of Moose #

419
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:55,000
# I got together with God and we stand #

420
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:02,500
# We sank in the snowball field, we thought we were on land #

421
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,500
# Oh, I'm from Canada # 

422
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,500
# Oh, that's my home, oh Canada #

423
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,500
# Oh, that's my home, oh Canada #

424
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,750
Then again, perhaps his karma was irreparably screwed.

425
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:29,140
Wasn't the hockey stick and the Stanley Cup enough for one day? 

426
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,213
Why did Ben still insist

427
00:40:36,313 --> 00:40:38,450
on taking a dubious de tour

428
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:43,905
to the world's largest prairie camel?

429
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,550
Just do me right now.

430
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,550
Please, please, please, please...

431
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Start, damned!

432
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:06,950
Fuck!

433
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,050
Damned!

434
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,850
Not here, not now...

435
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
God!

436
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,850
Oh! Come on!

437
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,250
Please, please. Don't do this right now.

438
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,350
Don't do this...

439
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,650
Damn it!

440
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,100
Why?

441
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,600
Why won't you start!

442
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,500
You have a new voice message.

443
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,600
Hey, I'm in Calendar, window seat

444
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,800
and I'm just reading about why Phil missed the cut.

445
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,900
Please call me.

446
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,782
If Ben's lifetime could

447
00:42:43,882 --> 00:42:46,205
be coffee and newspapers with Samantha,

448
00:42:46,305 --> 00:42:48,940
existence would be bliss.

449
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,000
I don't know how to thank you.

450
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,600
Most people wouldn't call, do you realized?

451
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,080
Well, they just kept on going.

452
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,300
It was not anything, really.

453
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
I'm sorry about your dog.

454
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,100
You know, the thing is...

455
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,940
Rudy slept in my bed longer than two husbands...

456
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,150
combined.

457
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,085
That's first time I cry in ten years.

458
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,460
Oh, looks like you got some dirty gas.

459
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,100
Is that serious?

460
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
No.

461
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,650
I just clean it up, won't take me long.

462
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,250
I never expected to end up twice divorced

463
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,750
and only see my son once a year if I'm lucky.

464
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,850
He lives with his dad?

465
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,900
He just turned 20.

466
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,805
Besides, his father won't aid well long before that happened.

467
00:45:20,905 --> 00:45:23,550
Come on, you do not have a 20-year-old son?

468
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,650
Yeah.

469
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,955
And a granddaughter who just turned 4.

470
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,900
I've only seen once.

471
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,955
My son works in Fort McMurray.

472
00:45:36,055 --> 00:45:39,900
The money is too good to keep him down here.

473
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,200
Why don't you leave?

474
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,800
Do something else.

475
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,900
I am too in debt.

476
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,750
And if the weather and the markets don't go the shit,

477
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:53,500
I might breakeven my loan payments at the end of the harvest.

478
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,600
I feel like an idiot if every farmer around here

479
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,760
wasn't in the same boat.

480
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,900
Does it make you bitter?

481
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:06,950
That's the thing, no.

482
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,750
The dirt has a way of hitching your pores.

483
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:20,820
Oh, if I can get laid every now and again, I might feel a lot happier.

484
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,200
No offense, but I like my man XXL.

485
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,620
Besides, when I make my move,

486
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,375
it usually involves few wine coolers

487
00:46:28,475 --> 00:46:31,280
and a complete lack of subtlety.

488
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,200
Well, let's go for a horse ride.

489
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,295
You know, actually I uh...  I've never ridden on the horse.

490
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:44,250
Oh, well obviously you've never lived.

491
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,000
# Never felt so good, never thought I am word #

492
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:11,200
# Again, now you're all alright #

493
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:23,000
# Look what I can see, everything we used to be, is back and now you're alright #

494
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,605
When I came out here, I think where else we really want to go.

495
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,505
Looking out over the hills,

496
00:47:35,605 --> 00:47:38,550
wondering if a former life he had been a cowboy,

497
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,897
part of Ben wished Fran wasn't so

498
00:47:40,997 --> 00:47:44,050
rigid about the size requirements of her man.

499
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:50,015
He also wished he had a case of wine coolers.

500
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,615
- Better than ever.  - Yes it is.

501
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,200
Ben's trip rekindled Fran's wanderlust.

502
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,109
That weekend,

503
00:48:22,209 --> 00:48:23,705
instead of fixing fences,

504
00:48:23,805 --> 00:48:27,300
Fran paid a surprise visit to her son in Fort McMurray.

505
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,550
Unfortunately, Brad was on a double shift.

506
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,855
The upshot, while killing time,

507
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:36,050
Fran finally met the lover for life.

508
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,150
Excuse me, 

509
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,810
can you tell me where Dawson Street is?

510
00:49:03,726 --> 00:49:04,726
"Welcome to Alberta: Wild Rose Country"

511
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,750
The world's largest Tipi was a major disappointment,

512
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:19,910
Ben couldn't say why.

513
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,765
He actually expected more

514
00:49:21,865 --> 00:49:25,000
from the world's largest dinosaur.

515
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,100
It was a 3 out of 10.

516
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,495
Maybe 3 and a half.

517
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,905
As most of you are probably already aware,

518
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:34,655
Dinosaur Provincial Park is home to the largest collection

519
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:36,750
of dinosaur bones in the world.

520
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:41,270
Only rivaled by China's Gobi Desert.

521
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,500
It makes you feel sort of insignificant, doesn't it?

522
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,500
Knowing that the most powerful species on the planet has been completely wiped out

523
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,235
reduced to a pile of bones.

524
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,605
One might conclude roaming somewhere

525
00:50:00,705 --> 00:50:02,905
among the bones of these ancient beasts,

526
00:50:03,005 --> 00:50:05,400
Grumps would sure be hidden.

527
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,060
Instead, Ben wondered if like their prehistoric friends,

528
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,050
the Grumps would be extinct.

529
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,800
True story.

530
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,850
In 1997, Gina Lalapola, an Italian stripper,

531
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:33,282
suffocated to death while waiting

532
00:50:33,382 --> 00:50:35,650
to jump out of the cake.

533
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,800
The point is we are all on borrowed time.

534
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,036
One minute you're trying to

535
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:41,700
find a decent song on the radio,

536
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,800
the next...

537
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,420
What is the minimum in life?

538
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,500
And so, inexplicably happy to be alive,

539
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,525
Ben tried to recreate one of those moving moments,

540
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:07,500
the kind where the hero dancers 

541
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,377
uninhibitedly finally able to symbolically

542
00:52:09,477 --> 00:52:11,650
throw of the shackles of convention

543
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,550
through the transformative power of a pop song.

544
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:16,150
# I need you here tonight #

545
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,850
# You make things right #

546
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,850
# Well every time I see you #

547
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:25,850
# It's gonna be a nice day #

548
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,550
Ben however couldn't pull of the feat.

549
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,600
He felt like an idiot trying to be that guy.

550
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,100
Moreover, he couldn't dance.

551
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,455
Six hours of relentless cold

552
00:54:09,555 --> 00:54:13,355
and Ben decided that he had enough of the allure

553
00:54:13,455 --> 00:54:16,090
of the open road and lack of the itinerary.

554
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:32,985
Not saving for the retirement had its advantages.

555
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:38,050
Mom and Dad are freaking out. We're all freaking out.

556
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:41,300
Get back to Toronto and deal with this.

557
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,700
Ben, it's your mother. I need to hear your voice.

558
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,180
I love you so so much.

559
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,100
Hi, son, we can handle this.

560
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,705
I called Dr. Morgan and he is able to get you

561
00:54:54,805 --> 00:54:59,400
with the top cancer specialist Sunnybrook.

562
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,200
I'm sorry.

563
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,800
I didn't mean to do that.

564
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:07,405
Could you give your mother a call, please?

565
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:17,900
# Let's go out, we'll take no prisoners #

566
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:25,900
# Lonely love, gotta leave it behind #

567
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,100
# We look like a million dollars #

568
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,350
# Every time they look at us, we'll blow their mind  #

569
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:50,650
# Let's get wrecked on Rolling Rock, and stroll down to the sea #

570
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:59,850
# I'll come to my senses there and then you'll come to me #

571
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,450
# Let's forget about all our friends and family #

572
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:10,200
# Let's forget about all our lovers, enemies #

573
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,850
# Let's go out when the sun goes down #

574
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,550
# Let's wrestle this city to the ground #

575
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,900
# We'll go out, we'll take no prisoners #

576
00:56:23,905 --> 00:56:27,450
# Lonely love we leave it behind #

577
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,300
# We look like a million dollars #

578
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:34,800
# Every time they look at us, we'll blow their mind #

579
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:38,450
# Every time they look at us, we'll blow their mind #

580
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:44,950
# Every time they look at us, we'll blow their mind #

581
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,150
Thank you very much.

582
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,590
I'll meet you anywhere.

583
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,800
You promised not to tell anyone.

584
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,200
I know.

585
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,950
And you promised that you gonna be come back in two days.

586
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,050
Are you coming home?

587
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,900
Not yet.

588
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,100
Then I will go to you.

589
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,500
You will?

590
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,100
Yeah.

591
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,350
Where are you?

592
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,800
Banff.

593
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,500
I'll book a flight tomorrow.

594
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,600
Bye.

595
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:18,509
Ben knew that

596
00:58:18,609 --> 00:58:20,255
with someone else along for the ride,

597
00:58:20,355 --> 00:58:24,010
looking for Grumps would seem idiotic.

598
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,600
Within two hours of

599
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,000
escaping the Presidential suite,

600
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,140
he was lost.

601
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,901
If he got to the Pacific Ocean

602
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:56,251
and ran out of west. What would he do?

603
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,850
Oh, my God

604
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,700
Jesus!

605
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,200
God boy, good boy!

606
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,900
Mick, down!

607
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,700
Down!

608
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,305
I'm so sorry. I didn't expect to see anybody up here.

609
00:59:09,405 --> 00:59:13,400
It's ok. It just caught me off guard is all.

610
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,250
Are you okay?

611
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:18,300
Yes, I'm fine. I just, I'm a...

612
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,300
I feel a little lightheaded.

613
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,140
- You want some water or something?  - Yeah, sure. Thanks.

614
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:35,800
# Un Canadien errant #

615
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,090
# Banni de ses foyers #

616
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,900
You know the song?

617
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,955
Yeah.

618
00:59:43,055 --> 00:59:46,350
# Un Canadien errant # 

619
00:59:46,355 --> 00:59:48,800
That was a supreme understatement.

620
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,800
Ben's mother had sung "Un Canadien errant",

621
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,960
a French Canadian folk song

622
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,900
to him every night growing up.

623
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,300
The words were embedded in his DNA.

624
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,650
Of all the songs Tracy could pick,

625
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:05,575
that she chose this one had to mean something.

626
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:12,250
# Des pays ¨¦trangers. #

627
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,450
All right

628
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:16,100
The ground rules of the campfire sing-along  

629
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,250
clearly state that everyone has to participate.

630
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:22,155
Honestly, you don't want me to sing.

631
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,600
Really. I insist.

632
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,750
# Si tu vois mon pays #

633
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,850
# Mon pays malheureux #

634
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
# Si tu vois mon pays #

635
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,455
Ben had never taken a complete inventory

636
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:46,720
of things he found unappealing about Samantha.

637
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,400
She was a routine girl.

638
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,450
Everything had to be done in a certain order.

639
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,834
Deviating from this costs

640
01:00:55,934 --> 01:00:59,200
sleepless and general irritability.

641
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,850
In spite of Ben's efforts, Samantha steadfastly refused to

642
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,826
quantify movies, books and 

643
01:01:04,926 --> 01:01:07,365
behavior of members of his family 

644
01:01:07,465 --> 01:01:09,205
on the 1 to 10 scale.

645
01:01:09,305 --> 01:01:11,155
A major disappointment to Ben,

646
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:16,500
as this had to be the filter through which he classified many parts of his life.

647
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,705
Ben regretted how their sex life

648
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:21,940
has lost some of its earlier carnal urgency.

649
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:25,610
Do you mind if we wait until tomorrow?

650
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,010
And finally, most annoying of all,

651
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:32,400
Samantha's jaw clicked when she ate. 

652
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,500
Ben was certain that as the years went by,

653
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,320
he would see still even notice it.

654
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,650
(French song: Un Canadien errant)
# Va, dis ¨¤ mes amis #

655
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,800
# Que je me souviens d'eux #

656
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:53,600
# Va, dis ¨¤ mes amis #

657
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,700
# Que je me souviens d'eux #

658
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,460
You have a fantastic voice.

659
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:06,000
It's nice of you to say that. I've long since given up

660
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,140
on the hope that I can sing.

661
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:14,400
Well, I have perfect pitch, and you can definitely sing.

662
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,710
That was dreadful! 

663
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,550
My fourth grade teacher lied to me.

664
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,650
What are you talking about?

665
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,200
It's not important.

666
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,550
So what's your second book about?

667
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,200
I didn't write a second novel.

668
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
Any ideas or...

669
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,700
I don't know. Oh, no. Rejection pretty much killed my creativity.

670
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:49,755
You know, my grandfather used to quote Thomas Edison to me

671
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,600
ad nauseam when I was a kid.

672
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,400
His favorite line,

673
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:58,205
"Many of life's failures are people who did not realize

674
01:02:58,305 --> 01:03:02,130
how close they were to success when they gave up."

675
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,585
Ok, but there's perseverance, and then it's just delusion.

676
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:18,705
Well, I guess somebody gonna to fill the world's delusional quotation.

677
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,040
What would you do if you have one week to live?

678
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,100
Maybe just do what I'm doing right now.

679
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,220
My mind is not on tomorrow or

680
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,200
yesterday, or even three hours from now. It's just here.

681
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,300
What would you do?

682
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,400
I'll make love to you.

683
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,500
Why?

684
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:07,600
I am just searching for a moment.

685
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:39,100
Samantha had managed to book a flight out that night

686
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:44,980
instead of next morning as planned. 

687
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,800
When Ben woke, he was deliriously content.

688
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,224
Maybe it was the fact that somehow,

689
01:04:56,324 --> 01:04:58,600
he has managed to outrun his demons.

690
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,000
But this road made a lot more sense

691
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,990
than treatment.

692
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:34,680
Where were you all night?

693
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,050
How can you just forgive me?

694
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,450
Aren't you upset? 

695
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,900
Of course I'm upset.

696
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,800
But at least you didn't lie about it.

697
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,800
And you are completely messed up right now.

698
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:57,350
So I'm telling myself it's not even about us.

699
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:59,400
Maybe later, I'll be angry.

700
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,600
But right now we have bigger things to deal with.

701
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:04,750
Like why wouldn't you come home.

702
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,850
I just can't.

703
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,100
It's selfish.

704
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,850
It's... it's incomprehensible.

705
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,150
You're being an asshole. Get treatment.

706
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:17,005
Do you really think there's no hope?

707
01:06:17,105 --> 01:06:19,900
I don't want to be a patient yet.

708
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:22,650
Not if there's no point.

709
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,091
So you just wanna keep running

710
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:26,005
without even fighting? Of course, there's a point.

711
01:06:26,105 --> 01:06:28,105
What if this is fighting?

712
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,400
What if this is the right thing to do?

713
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:33,550
I know,

714
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:35,650
everything has changed.

715
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,905
But Why? What happened?

716
01:06:38,005 --> 01:06:39,900
Because it couldn't be just about the diagnosis.

717
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,100
Because, Samantha, I am staring at a wall that I cannot get over.

718
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:49,200
Because I don't know what the good answers are anymore.

719
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,340
How about being honest?

720
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,150
Ok.

721
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:01,520
Do you wanna know what the first thing that went through my mind was

722
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,100
when the doctor told me that I had cancer?

723
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,200
The very first thing?

724
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,200
That is I wanted to call off the wedding.

725
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,800
I was absolutely positive that I didn't want to get married,

726
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,150
and I didn't want to go back to work, and really, I didn't want to do anything.

727
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,905
That's a normal reaction. Even I wanted to call off the wedding.

728
01:07:19,005 --> 01:07:21,565
But, Samantha, it's not about the cancer.

729
01:07:21,665 --> 01:07:24,400
It's about the life that I built for myself.

730
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,400
Why am I over insured?

731
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,905
Why do I care so much about being responsible all the time?

732
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:33,555
Why do I give a shit about what kind of appliances we're putting into our kitchen?

733
01:07:33,655 --> 01:07:37,050
I am becoming my father. And no offense to my father, I love him.

734
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:41,300
He is a decent man, but that was never my life's ambition.

735
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,290
So what's the alternative then?

736
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,300
This!

737
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,400
This is the alternative.

738
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,300
You can't just keeping driving around forever.

739
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,650
At some point, this is gonna catch up with you.

740
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,250
Especially you.

741
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,350
I just want time.

742
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,605
If I can take each one of these days and turn them into life, 

743
01:08:02,705 --> 01:08:05,400
and then it has to be a better choice.

744
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,050
But you don't have to be dead.

745
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,605
You know that you are allowed to go against the odds.

746
01:08:10,705 --> 01:08:14,100
You are allowed to do this for us.

747
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,600
This isn't about us.

748
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:21,715
That's the problem, Samantha. This is about me.

749
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:28,150
Did you ever love me?

750
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,955
Not the way you deserved.

751
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,085
So why did you asked me to marry you then?

752
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,655
Because so much of me wanted to.

753
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:55,240
And because I couldn't think of a reason why not to anymore.

754
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,500
I never thought that... what we had was a fallback position.

755
01:09:06,005 --> 01:09:08,300
A safe choice.

756
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:13,050
How could I not have seen it?

757
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,300
All the indecision, all the hesitation,

758
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:20,050
they're always about us,

759
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:22,550
not about you.

760
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,600
I'm an idiot.

761
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:36,750
Samantha.

762
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:39,825
Don't you dare follow me.

763
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:09,900
# We stay up all night and watch the boats #

764
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:24,300
# From underneath the bridge, the trucks fly #

765
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:36,325
# And in the bravest moments I watch you #

766
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:42,825
# And we take turns #

767
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:47,825
# looking away #

768
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:56,800
# I adore you #

769
01:10:57,550 --> 01:11:04,100
# I want to follow you #

770
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:11,500
# Make a boat out of this cigarette pack #

771
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:19,200
# Watch it float away and hope it comes back #

772
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,500
Shut up!

773
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:23,050
Hi, Mom.

774
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:55,050
# I got out of bed today, Swear to God I couldn't see my face #

775
01:14:55,850 --> 01:15:00,950
# I got out of bed today, staring at a ghost #

776
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:06,950
# Who forgot to float away, didn't have all that much to say #

777
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:12,650
# Wouldn't even tell me his own name. Where'd my body go? #

778
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,650
# Where oh where'd my body go? Africa or Mexico? #

779
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,650
# Where or where'd my body go? Where'd my body go? #

780
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,750
# Oh. Have you seen my ghost? Seen my ghost, seen my ghost? #

781
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,650
# Oh. Have you seen my ghost? Staring at the ground? #

782
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,750
It's great, thanks.

783
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,850
Enjoy.

784
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:44,450
Excuse me.

785
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:48,320
Can you help us make a picture?

786
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,750
Sure.

787
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,100
Thank you so much.

788
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:04,200
Thank you.

789
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:07,250
- You are welcome.  - You are Canadian, ya?

790
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:08,800
Yeah.

791
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:14,550
I wanna say that you live in one of the most beautiful countries in the world.

792
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:19,150
I know.

793
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:27,450
Their love wasn't an illusion.

794
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:29,450
However, like most relationships,

795
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:33,150
there were a few roar waves that could have capsized it.

796
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:35,350
In those times of rough seas,

797
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:40,550
Ben's photograph was a touch tone for what was best.

798
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:53,250
# Bad day, looking for a way home #

799
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:58,550
# Looking for the great escape #

800
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:08,250
# Gets in his car and drives away, far from all the things that we are #

801
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:15,250
# Puts on a smile and breathes it in and breathes it out, he says #

802
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:22,750
# Bye bye bye to all of the noise #

803
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:31,750
# Oh, he says, bye bye bye to all of the noise #

804
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:38,650
# Hey, child, things are looking down #

805
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:43,750
# That's okay, you don't need to win anyways # 

806
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:53,750
# Don't be afraid, just eat up all the gray and it will fade all away #

807
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,750
# Don't let yourself fall down #

808
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,575
No one can say with any amount of certainty

809
01:22:28,675 --> 01:22:31,050
what Grumps actually looks like.

810
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:33,350
He is hard to pin down that way.

811
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:37,300
However, a good rule of thumb his father always believed,

812
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,050
You'll definitely know him when you see him.

813
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:42,798
And Ben was positively certain,

814
01:22:42,898 --> 01:22:47,063
that the universe had coughed up at Grumps. 

815
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,063
There's only one thing to do. 

816
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:18,200
# I don't fight, and I don't steal # 

817
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:27,500
# I might believe in things that you don't think are real #

818
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:35,500
# I know my wrong and I can learn to fight #

819
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:47,500
# I keep my heart on the outside so it can see more life #

820
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,500
# See more life #

821
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:59,200
You smell like the sea.

822
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,375
What is the divorce rate?

823
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,400
56%.

824
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:26,200
That's not very good odds.

825
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,105
They're better than one in ten.

826
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:33,900
Yeah, I suppose they are.

827
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:42,065
When you deal with individuals, you throw out the numbers. 

828
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,600
You have to.

829
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,700
Does it need to be over?

830
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:56,950
I asked a man when I was on the road,

831
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,715
"How do you know you're in love?"

832
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:05,490
He told me, "If you have to ask,

833
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,600
you're not."

834
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,080
You never had to ask anyone, did you, Sam?

835
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:17,750
No.

836
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,900
Of course not.

837
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:29,650
Are you angry?

838
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:33,450
Yeah.

839
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,300
And not just about that.

840
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,250
Of all the various ways this sucks,

841
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:50,430
I'm obsessed with a completely selfish idea

842
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:53,935
that everybody is gonna think that she is a woman 

843
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:57,700
who left her fianc¨¦ because he had cancer.

844
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:03,100
I'm not gonna think that.

845
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:06,865
But I think of that about someone if I heard that.

846
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:16,555
I'm sorry I got us into this mess.

847
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,125
You should be.

848
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,600
How are you feeling?

849
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,400
Ancient.

850
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,200
Is your trip worthy?

851
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:46,750
Yeah.

852
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:50,330
Did you take pictures?

853
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:56,195
A lifetime's worth.

854
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:18,900
# Night can't come quick enough #

855
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:27,195
# My faults shine in the sun #

856
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,900
# Real girls don't take aim, like kings do these days #

857
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:41,500
# I made my mind up to be a black-winged bird #

858
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:48,500
# Never turn my head for how things were #

859
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,500
# Things we can't change #

860
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:34,000
When you get those rare moments of clarity,

861
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:36,700
those flashes when the universe makes sense,

862
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,500
you tried desperately to hold on to them.

863
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,210
They are the life boats for the darker times

864
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:43,732
when the vastness of all,

865
01:28:43,832 --> 01:28:46,305
the incomprehensible nature of life

866
01:28:46,405 --> 01:28:48,900
is completely illusive.

867
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,450
So the question becomes, or should be all along,

868
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:55,650
what would you do if you know you only have one day

869
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:58,810
or one week, or one month to live?

870
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,150
What life boat would you grab onto?

871
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,250
What secret would you tell?

872
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,600
What band would you see?

873
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,720
What person would you declare your love to?

874
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,300
What wish would you fulfill?

875
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,740
What exotic locale would you fly to for a coffee?

876
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:21,150
What book would you write?

877
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:32,350
(One week by Ben Tyler)

878
01:29:44,275 --> 01:30:01,675
(To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield)
