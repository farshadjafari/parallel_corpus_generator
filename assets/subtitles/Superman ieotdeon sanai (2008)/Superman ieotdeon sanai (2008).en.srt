1
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:34,928
It probably looked like this,

2
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:37,362
when he first arrived on Earth.

3
00:00:37,798 --> 00:00:40,767
Flying freely
through the clouds...

4
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,702
Thinking it was
the most beautiful

5
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:44,693
place in the Universe.

6
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:47,507
That is, before he came down

7
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:50,476
and met humans.

8
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,983
The most untrusting,
impatient,

9
00:00:56,983 --> 00:00:59,781
and selfish beings.

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,083
Hey did not realize
he had come...

There is a nationwide
yellow dust warning...

Gianna JUN

18
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:50,897
Exhaust gas

19
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:52,365
greater air pollution

Though he sometimes
makes mistakes,

22
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:07,180
He is a friend to
the animals

23
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,172
and well-liked by hikers.

24
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:13,544
Oh dear!

25
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:15,922
The baby bird fell down.

26
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:17,184
See ThaT bird?

27
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,088
Soo-jung hiT iT wiTh a sTone

28
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,791
Really?

29
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,806
Now ThaT's a paTheTic face.

30
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:38,403
He won'T like This.
IT makes him look so sTupid.

31
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:46,653
- Hey, Bong?
- Yes?

32
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:48,314
Who are we?

33
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:50,847
The viewers' slaves.

34
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:53,892
Who parked in The
handicapped zone?

35
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:56,052
The security called!

36
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,264
Go move iT.

37
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:06,399
I'm a slave, alrighT.

38
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:26,385
PARK's Team found him by accidenT.
Isn'T he someThing?

39
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,261
He goes around helping people.

40
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:32,254
Ah, whaT did he call himself?

41
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:35,029
I can'T sTand people.

42
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:37,270
Especially, crazy ones.

43
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:43,943
BuT you've been doing human inTeresT
sTories for over 3 years.

44
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:48,778
ThaT's how I became a chain smoker

We can Turn This inTo a hiT!

52
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:19,007
He forces down insTanT noodles.

53
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:26,917
STruggles To pay for us and
his family sTudying in Canada.

58
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:51,077
I can'T Take The narraTor's voice
ringing in my ears anymore!

59
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:53,213
She wasn't kidding.

60
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:55,113

Where are you going?

63
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,251
Africa!

64
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:19,261
All settled.
I goT a camera, Too.

65
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:22,131
Can I have
The signing bonus firsT?

66
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:26,243
I need iT To go somewhere.

67
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:31,476
WhaT? The Team's pulling ouT?

68
00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:32,676
Why?

69
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,851
WhaT?

70
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:39,751
BiT by a lion?

71
00:06:41,227 --> 00:06:43,252
How?

72
00:06:44,798 --> 00:06:49,292
The sTupid idioTs...

73
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:53,137
Lion's don'T obey like caTs...

74
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:20,660
Damn iT!

75
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:30,069
Thief!

76
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:32,842
Thief!

77
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:34,845
GeT him!

78
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:53,696
The basTard.

79
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:30,760
Be careful.

80
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:34,498
Those beasTs are really scary.

81
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:37,508
They kill wiThouT conscience.

82
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,144
Help me!

83
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:42,815

84
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,282
He Took my bag!

85
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:56,820
Drive! Go! Go! Go!

00:08:59,065 --> 00:09:01,056

00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:27,020
LeT go!

88
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,922
Wake up.

89
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:11,366
Where am I?

90
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:17,066
The pasT, presenT,
or The fuTure?

91
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:25,175
I've seen you before...

92
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,344
We jusT meT...

93
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:31,118
I remember you...

94
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,494
Didn'T you fly
in The skies wiTh me?

95
00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:36,396
Me? No...

96
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:38,830
Maybe iT was The fuTure...

97
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:42,496
Anyway, I'm glad To
see you again.

98
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:45,238
Nice To meeT you.

99
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:47,140
No need To Thank me!

100
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,768
IT's my duty To help oThers.

101
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:56,938
Did you help someone
a few days ago...

102
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:00,887
I'm so glad To see you again.

103
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:06,519
I missed working
aT The paper wiTh you.

104
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:17,969
STrengTh doesn'T
open iron doors.

105
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:21,036
BuT a small key.

106
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:33,048
ThoughT you haTed people
and wenT To Africa.

107
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:35,782
You found a lion around here?

108
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:40,092
Yah, iT's hiding inside
ThaT box.

109
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:11,324
Instead of the African lion,

110
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:14,020
she found a strange,
mottled man.

111
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:25,060
Tape! Go buy some!
Hurry!

112
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:28,730
Freeze! How dare you!

113
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:33,369
It was no time to be picky.

114
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:38,643
Though he may not be all there,
he seemed harmless.

115
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:41,946
Unlike African lions...

116
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:49,418
Superman?

117
00:12:52,598 --> 00:12:56,466
I know you don'T recognize me
like This.

118
00:12:56,936 --> 00:12:58,870
I didn'T eiTher.

119
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:02,601
BuT how can I forgeT
who I really am?

120
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:05,336
I sTill have a mission
To compleTe.

121
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:10,112
So you're saying you're...

122
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:15,520
ThaT's righT.

123
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:19,722
The lasT survivor
of planeT KrypTon.

124
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:23,161
And friend To humans.

125
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:34,335
I'm Superman.

126
00:13:43,816 --> 00:13:47,775
If you are,
you should be super sTrong.

127
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:50,949
Didn'T look like iT before.

128
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,058
Getting beaT up by ThaT Thief...

129
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:56,895
Can you fly?

130
00:14:03,903 --> 00:14:08,169
IT's 'cuz The bald villain
made me This way!

131
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:12,743
ThaT basTard...

132
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:15,982
He puT krypToniTe
inside my head

133
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:19,349
To sTop me
from using my superpowers.

134
00:14:20,786 --> 00:14:26,019
I escaped from Them
buT noT The krypToniTe...

135
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,392
Sadly...

136
00:14:29,195 --> 00:14:30,992
IT's sTill in here.

137
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,630
Here! RighT here!

138
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:42,102
I'll geT iT ouT someday
and geT my superpowers back!

139
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:45,233
And desTroy The villains!

140
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,481
Then I'll be able To fly.

141
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:58,958
The bald villain...

142
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,121
He's using radio waves
To find me!

143
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,191
Damn krypToniTe...

144
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:10,067
Are you okay, sir?

145
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:17,810
Oaky, okay.

146
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,541
Chewing gum will creaTe
jammers and block The waves.

147
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:23,774
They won'T be able To find me.

148
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:28,481
Thanks friend,
for worrying abouT me.

149
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:31,824
UnTil The krypToniTe
comes ouT!

150
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:33,815
We should join forces!

151
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:37,188
Ready?

152
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:39,465
Come on!

153
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:40,830
You, Too.

154
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:44,370
For peace on earth!

155
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,906
Superheroes uniTe!

156
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:49,431
Cross!

157
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:56,248
WhaT are you doing?

158
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:59,649
I'm pushing Earth away
from The sun.

159
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:04,085
North Pole is melTing
'cuz The Earth is getting hotter!

160
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,781
I need To cool iT down!

161
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:09,729
Superman's greatest weakness is

162
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:11,822
kryptonite from his home planet.

163
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:15,890
If it gets near him,
he loses his superpowers.

164
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,467
Slow down! STop!

165
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,478
He claims he has
a piece of kryptonite

166
00:16:25,478 --> 00:16:27,880
inside his head.

167
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,111
But he still helps others
Even without superpower.

168
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,975
JusT a few more sTeps!

169
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:38,424
His work is not limited
to just humans.

170
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:42,554
He is a savior to lost pets
and a friend to children.

171
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,563
I found her!

172
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:53,103
He fights against injustice.

173
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:58,202
He sets out on the streets
to protect the Earth.

174
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:04,550
Rotten beasTs!
How dare you!

175
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,619
ExhausT gas heaTs up
The Earth.

176
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,454
Then The North Pole will melT.

177
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:11,389
If The North Pole melTs,
Jaws will come!

178
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,827
He never revealed
where he lived.

179
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,192
I'm laTe!

180
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:21,901
But everyday at 6 p.m.,

181
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:24,461
he went inside a phone booth.

182

Can'T you hear The cries of
The polar bears and penguins?

195
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:18,150
Penguins live in The SouTh Pole.

196
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,325
I'll blow up the bridge,
Superman!

197
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:39,545
Everyone was terrified
by the bald villain's threats!

198
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:41,376
They all just watched!

199
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:50,613
I flew to the bridge
to stop the bomb!

200
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,815
Everyone shouted!

201
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:56,755

00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:04,194
The bomb blew up

204
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,906
Cars were abouT To fall off!

205
00:19:06,906 --> 00:19:09,466
People screamed in fear!

00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:17,207
I held The bridge up
wiTh all my mighT.

209
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:21,679

I almosT pooped in my panTs.

214
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:55,718
Then flew away inTo The sky.

215
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:03,661
LaTer, The sTars beamed
beauTifully in The nighT sky.

216
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:10,560
They looked like millions
ofjewels.

00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:17,309
Liar! People can'T fly!

218
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:19,675

361
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:55,916
By The way, sTop calling me sir.
We're friends.

362
00:34:59,424 --> 00:35:00,891
Ah, Superman?

363
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:08,562
You losT your powers 'cuz of The
Thing inside your head.

364
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:12,067
Then why do you help people?
Isn'T iT hard?

365
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:18,099
If I don'T,
I'll forgeT how To help.

366
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:21,510
Then I'll forgeT
who I really am.

367
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,209
ThaT's exacTly
whaT The villains wanT.

368
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,115
So you won'T forgeT
you're Superman?

369
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:32,380
Yup.

370
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:38,527
And helping people makes me
feel good.

371
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:41,358
Then more endorphins come ouT.

372
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:46,961
And ThaT makes
The krypToniTe weaker.

373
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:53,940
Then iT'll pop ouT, like This.

374
00:36:03,221 --> 00:36:05,348
My real house is in North Pole

375
00:36:06,858 --> 00:36:11,625
buT iT's melTing
so I'm sTaying here for now.

376
00:36:16,267 --> 00:36:17,427
Come on.

377
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:20,368
20%% % of glaciers melted away.

378
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:26,010
18%% % of China turns to desert

379
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,537
Explosive spear
found on 130 year old whale

380
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,983
'Super whale of North Pole.

381
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:39,419
IT goT caughT
'cuz The glaciers melTed.

382
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:45,524
The villains hiT him wiTh a spear
aT age 10

383
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:48,131
BuT he lived To be 130!

384
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:50,766
Isn'T iT amazing?

385
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:55,873
If you ever meeT Jaws, say...

386
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,068
IT's Jaws! Jaws is here!

387
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,205
Then Super Whale will come
To The rescue.

388
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:29,168
Your lungs are sTill okay...

389
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,403
BuT you should quiT, now.

390
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:38,815
Mountains burned by cigarettes

391
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:49,260
Those basTards!

392
00:37:49,427 --> 00:37:52,863
You rotten villains!
Take ThaT!

393
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,497
Come on!

394
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,201
You can'T chase me away,

395
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,239
STop demolishing The earth!

396
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,639

397
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:10,839
I didn'T expecT a call

398
00:38:12,784 --> 00:38:14,308

00:38:14,786 --> 00:38:19,587
Then why are

00:38:19,824 --> 00:38:25,285
STop worrying abouT everyone else.

00:38:31,135 --> 00:38:33,035
Yeah righT...

403
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:38,034
Think you're MoTher Theresa?
Or Superman?

404
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:42,069
I gotta go, I'm busy.

405
00:38:43,247 --> 00:38:46,444
You'd better call me back laTer.

406
00:38:56,994 --> 00:38:58,894
Who were you Talking To?

407
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,726
Why'd you menTion my name?

408
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:03,101

409
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:06,195
Or The lasso will
squeeze you hard.

410
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:10,733
IT was... my boyfriend.

411
00:39:10,942 --> 00:39:12,739
He's in Mongolia?

412
00:39:13,177 --> 00:39:17,949
He wenT for a shooT and
sTarted helping

413
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:19,584
people There monThs ago.

414
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:22,109
Yellow dusT comes from Mongolia.

415
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,155
Villains are Turning iT
inTo a desert!

416
00:39:25,323 --> 00:39:28,918
He's fighTing There?

417
00:39:29,026 --> 00:39:31,153
WhaT a greaT superhero!

00:39:31,295 --> 00:39:33,286
I wanT To meeT him someday!

419
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:35,899
FirsT, I'll wriTe him a letter.

420
00:39:43,374 --> 00:39:45,239
Is iT your birthday Today, friend?

421
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,136
Yeah...

422
00:39:47,245 --> 00:39:48,780
Let's protect the earth

423
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,372
Then you can have ThaT.

424
00:39:52,784 --> 00:39:57,153
IT's Wonder Woman's magic lasso
of TruTh.

425
00:39:57,321 --> 00:39:59,380
Looks like a laundry line...

426
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:09,223
This is very precious.
I'll show you how iT works.

427
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,927
You'll always hear The TruTh.

428
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:18,475
Do you have any family,
Superman?

429
00:40:18,576 --> 00:40:20,009
Family?

430
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:26,579
Everyone on Earth is my family.

431
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:33,880
Do you really like helping people?

432
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:35,649
Isn'T iT hard?

433
00:40:36,093 --> 00:40:38,254
You geT hurt someTimes.

434
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,696
Of course!
I'm changing The fuTure.

435
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:48,436
NoT many species in The universe
have such powers.

436
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:51,565
The fuTure?

437
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:11,558
If I didn'T pull This rope,
you'd sTill be There.

438
00:41:12,697 --> 00:41:15,495
BuT now you're here.

439
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:22,197
The fuTure has changed.

440
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:26,603
Helping oThers is like This.

441
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:33,509
Changing someone's fuTure...

442
00:41:39,957 --> 00:41:44,189
BuT is ThaT always a good Thing?

443
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:55,206
See! The villains puT a bomb
over your head!

444
00:41:55,206 --> 00:41:59,472
If I hadn'T pulled you here,
you could've died!

445
00:42:12,189 --> 00:42:14,020
I'd better geT going...

446
00:42:21,566 --> 00:42:23,397
Hi, friend!

447
00:42:52,396 --> 00:42:54,830
Pass The ball, please.

448
00:43:45,249 --> 00:43:47,774
I hiT iT all The way To Mongolia!

449
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:25,352
GeT down!

450
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:31,295
- Can Superman fly?
- Of course!

451
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:32,463
NoT yeT!

452
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:37,230
You musT geT The krypToniTe
ouT firsT!

453
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:54,516
Thanks for worrying
abouT me, friend.

454
00:44:54,618 --> 00:44:56,483
And for believing me.

455
00:44:58,155 --> 00:45:03,024
I promise To fly in The sky
wiTh you one day.

456
00:45:17,942 --> 00:45:20,811
Like Super Whale with a spear
stuck in its head...

457
00:45:20,811 --> 00:45:23,939
He has the kryptonite secret
in his head.

458
00:45:24,215 --> 00:45:27,051
To remember he is Superman...

459
00:45:27,051 --> 00:45:29,212
He always went out
on a mission to help.

460
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:36,826
But to listen to him...

461
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:40,556
Earthlings were always too busy.

462
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,264
Although his life seemed
alien and Ionely...

463
00:45:47,505 --> 00:45:51,134
He had his moments of excitement.

464
00:46:03,487 --> 00:46:07,651
Earthlings are fighTing TogeTher
To proTecT Earth!

465
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:10,895
Happy To find more on your side?

466
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:12,192
Of course!

467
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:30,079
Earth Day 2007

468
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:17,186
Hey, Superman!

469
00:47:17,862 --> 00:47:18,851
WaiT!

470
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:22,456
Earth Day 2007

471
00:47:32,042 --> 00:47:35,876
Save The Earth!

472
00:47:37,882 --> 00:47:42,512
Change The fuTure!

473
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:14,128
We know you're there, Superman!
Surrender!

474
00:51:14,231 --> 00:51:16,222
We got you surrounded!

475
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:18,267
There's no way out!

476
00:51:18,402 --> 00:51:20,165
Surrender Superman!

477
00:51:20,304 --> 00:51:21,601
Surrender!

478
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:23,639
Surrender now!

479
00:51:27,277 --> 00:51:30,474
Who am I? Remember!
Who am I!

480
00:51:31,715 --> 00:51:33,376
Bald villains!

481
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:38,350
You evil beasT!

482
00:51:42,226 --> 00:51:44,057

00:52:03,914 --> 00:52:05,973

00:52:39,616 --> 00:52:43,746
WhaT now?
WhaT if he goes To jail?

488
00:52:43,921 --> 00:52:45,718
WhaT if we can'T air This?

489
00:52:45,889 --> 00:52:49,326
How did he manage To escape?

490
00:52:49,326 --> 00:52:54,093
He musT really be Superman.

491
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:58,930
Soo-jung? You really don'T know
where he wenT?

492
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:02,996
Maybe he flew off inTo space?

493
00:53:04,608 --> 00:53:11,682
He injured The workers
and damaged Their equipmenT!

494
00:53:11,682 --> 00:53:14,913
And The show is seT To air soon!

495
00:53:16,153 --> 00:53:19,953
I'll Take care of everything.
Don'T worry.

496
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:42,971
Eden Psychiatric Hospital
Gwang-ju

497
00:53:53,123 --> 00:53:55,250
Wonder Woman

498
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,979
You know
I can't show his medical

499
00:54:15,979 --> 00:54:19,005
records without consent.

500
00:54:19,516 --> 00:54:21,279
Please, help me doctor.

501
00:54:22,286 --> 00:54:24,982
Or he'll go to jail.

502
00:54:26,023 --> 00:54:27,854
He could die...

503
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:32,226
He tried to jump off a building
a few days ago!

504
00:54:32,329 --> 00:54:35,662
Then you can'T finish your sTory,
is ThaT iT?

505
00:54:41,138 --> 00:54:44,107
Finishing iT is The problem.

506
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:48,903
IT's all coming To an end...

507
00:54:49,112 --> 00:54:50,477
Why?

508
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,946
You feel sorry for him?

509
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,152
I ThoughT people in your field

510
00:54:55,152 --> 00:54:57,848
did noT care abouT ThaT...

511
00:55:04,695 --> 00:55:07,391
I know he's not normal...

512
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,965
But he seems happy...

513
00:55:15,806 --> 00:55:18,741
But we can't let him live
like that forever...

514
00:55:23,714 --> 00:55:26,478
He's living in a dream world.

515
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:29,186
A dream is just a dream.

516
00:55:29,186 --> 00:55:31,677
He can't stay there forever.

517
00:55:33,757 --> 00:55:36,487
It's time to help him wake up.

518
00:55:38,995 --> 00:55:43,989
But waking him up may not be
what's best for him.

519
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:48,705
Reality can feel like hell to him.

520
00:55:48,705 --> 00:55:51,299
Are you okay?
You'll be fine.

521
00:56:28,111 --> 00:56:29,806
Thanks for hiding me.

522
00:56:32,349 --> 00:56:37,082
I Think The krypToniTe will
come ouT soon.

523
00:56:37,521 --> 00:56:39,011
How do you know?

524
00:56:39,623 --> 00:56:41,454
I can feel iT.

525
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:46,186
IT's almosT Time
To compleTe my final mission.

526
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:49,558
Once I do, This will come ouT.

527
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:52,134
And I'll geT my superpowers back.

528
00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:02,809
I once saw a lion eaT a rabbiT
on 'Animal Kingdom'.

529
00:57:04,014 --> 00:57:08,144
The poor little bunny...

530
00:57:09,986 --> 00:57:12,456
I resenTed The person
who filmed iT.

531
00:57:12,456 --> 00:57:16,859
Why didn'T she help The rabbiT?

532
00:57:18,428 --> 00:57:23,263
BuT iT musT've been hard
for her To film iT,

533
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:26,929
Though iT was herjob.

534
00:57:37,514 --> 00:57:40,244
Wonder Woman's lasso!

535
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,659
Why?

536
00:57:52,662 --> 00:57:54,653
SomeThing else you wanTed To know?

Then I'll be able To fly again...

00:58:45,882 --> 00:58:46,983

Help me!

576
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:17,667
The North Pole is
melTing like ice cream.

577
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:20,568
Really? Did you learn
ThaT in kindergarten?

578
01:01:20,704 --> 01:01:23,873
Then where will
The polar bears live?

579
01:01:23,873 --> 01:01:26,743
Well, They can go To
The SouTh Pole.

580
01:01:26,743 --> 01:01:31,112
No! The North Pole is
Their home!

581
01:01:31,381 --> 01:01:34,350
Daddy, is The North Pole
really melTing?

582
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:38,687
I'll make sure iT doesn'T.

583
01:01:39,689 --> 01:01:43,147
'Cuz daddy's Superman...

584
01:01:43,393 --> 01:01:45,795
Tell me a sTory, daddy.

585
01:01:45,795 --> 01:01:46,896
Superman keys and locks

586
01:01:46,896 --> 01:01:52,391
Let me tell you a story
about a little boy.

587
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:58,771
He lived in a bright,
warm little town.

588
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:02,068
His dream was to fly.

589
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:09,417
One day, villains attacked and

590
01:02:09,953 --> 01:02:12,478
The boy's faTher
wenT ouT To fighT.

591
01:02:14,657 --> 01:02:17,592
His faTher promised

592
01:02:17,761 --> 01:02:22,596
he'd reTurn
if The boy did good Things.

593
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:29,229
And ThaT someday...

594
01:02:33,276 --> 01:02:35,870
He'd be able To fly...

595
01:02:37,714 --> 01:02:39,773
Like a bird...

596
01:03:02,438 --> 01:03:06,966
The boy grew up
and also became a father.

597
01:03:08,111 --> 01:03:13,981
But villains took
his family, again.

598
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:21,647
Honey?

599
01:03:29,065 --> 01:03:31,431
Honey? No!

600
01:03:33,403 --> 01:03:35,530
Ji-young! Ji-young!

601
01:03:36,272 --> 01:03:40,038
You'll save me, righT daddy?

602
01:03:40,176 --> 01:03:43,805

Ji-young! Hold on!
Daddy will save you!

605
01:03:53,122 --> 01:04:00,688
When I counT To 100 you'll Turn
inTo Superman and save me.

606
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:04,334
One, two, Three...

01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:07,303

Six...

611
01:04:23,319 --> 01:04:25,219
Seven...

612
01:04:27,757 --> 01:04:29,918
Eight...

613
01:04:31,361 --> 01:04:33,329

Please help me!

616
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:29,585
No one tried to help.

617
01:05:29,585 --> 01:05:32,188
Man survives car explosion
Wife and daughter die
No one tried to help.

618
01:05:32,188 --> 01:05:33,018
Man survives car explosion
Wife and daughter die

619
01:05:33,122 --> 01:05:37,422
'Cuz the villains put kryptonite
inside their heads.

620
01:05:39,228 --> 01:05:42,288
So that they'd forget
who they are...

621
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:49,837
And the amazing powers they have...

622
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,414
Tell us your name.

623
01:06:08,491 --> 01:06:12,655
My name is LEE Hyun-suk.

624
01:06:14,664 --> 01:06:17,224
Are you Superman?

625
01:06:18,134 --> 01:06:19,601
No.

626
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:25,130
Did you once Think you
were Superman?

627
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,410
Yes.

628
01:06:28,611 --> 01:06:30,602
Why did you Think ThaT?

629
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,811
When I did...

630
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:41,252
I Think I felT better.

631
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:45,189
And who are you now, sir?

632
01:06:50,967 --> 01:06:55,563
JusT a normal person...

633
01:06:56,739 --> 01:06:59,003
Like The resT of you here.

634
01:07:03,379 --> 01:07:05,745
Who is Superman?

635
01:07:11,454 --> 01:07:13,388
Superman is...

636
01:07:18,027 --> 01:07:21,087
JusT a characTer from a movie.

637
01:07:30,306 --> 01:07:32,331
When I was young...

638
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:38,337
I waTched Superman
wiTh my faTher aT The movies.

639
01:07:42,652 --> 01:07:45,815
KrypToniTe was a bulleT?

640
01:07:47,623 --> 01:07:50,387
How can a man live
wiTh a bulleT inside his head?

641
01:07:50,526 --> 01:07:53,120
He's very lucky.

642
01:07:53,262 --> 01:07:57,562
The brain healed fasT
because he was young.

643
01:07:57,667 --> 01:07:59,969
He had seizures Though.

644
01:07:59,969 --> 01:08:02,597
ThaT's why he received
TreaTmenT here.

645
01:08:03,739 --> 01:08:05,866
He really is Superman,

646
01:08:06,008 --> 01:08:08,340
He survived a bulleT.

647
01:08:08,678 --> 01:08:11,977
BuT where'd he geT shoT?

648
01:08:14,183 --> 01:08:16,981
Does he have memories
of his family?

649
01:08:17,386 --> 01:08:20,014
They're not simply gone, are they?

650
01:08:22,058 --> 01:08:23,821
His memory is intact.

651
01:08:23,993 --> 01:08:27,964
But we gave him drugs
to repress his emotions.

652
01:08:27,964 --> 01:08:29,989
He can't feel sadness.

653
01:08:33,002 --> 01:08:37,166
The path between his memories
and his emotions is blocked.

654
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,441
He won't get angry at you.

655
01:09:01,364 --> 01:09:05,801
The kryptonite...
Are you okay, now?

656
01:09:08,337 --> 01:09:12,708
It doesn't hurt, if I take pills.

657
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:15,040
Social Security
LEE Hyun- suk

658
01:09:17,446 --> 01:09:20,006
I worried for no reason.

659
01:09:22,018 --> 01:09:24,748
I take two pills a day

660
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:28,149
and feel calm...
And at peace...

661
01:09:54,383 --> 01:09:59,252
Even if Earth is getting hotter
and the North Pole is melting?

662
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:11,625
ThaT's noT good...

663
01:10:16,606 --> 01:10:18,540
IT can'T...

664
01:10:34,156 --> 01:10:36,215
BuT why can'T I worry?

665
01:10:48,804 --> 01:10:53,743
A 5m long shark that lives in
tropical currents...

666
01:10:53,743 --> 01:10:58,806
Has come up to our coasts
due to global warming and warmer waters.

667
01:10:58,981 --> 01:11:02,551
The violent white shark is...

668
01:11:02,551 --> 01:11:05,452
also known as 'Jaws'
from the movies.

669
01:11:11,027 --> 01:11:15,191
A man who spenT many difficulT
years alone...

670
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:18,994
Has now reTurned To our side.
We wish him all The besT.

671
01:11:20,336 --> 01:11:23,237
- ThaT's The ending subTiTles?
- Yes.

672
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,172
Too much of a happy ending?

673
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:29,434
No.

674
01:11:30,946 --> 01:11:32,573
IT's okay.

675
01:11:32,982 --> 01:11:35,416
Superman looks so differenT.

676
01:11:38,154 --> 01:11:40,384
Yeah, he's changed a loT.

677
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:43,225
You've changed a loT, Too.

678
01:11:43,225 --> 01:11:47,355
Using twice The Tape
and more close-ups.

679
01:11:49,065 --> 01:11:51,556
I'll hand This over for recording.

680
01:11:55,071 --> 01:11:57,938
How abouT going ouT for drinks?

681
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,271
To celebraTe Superman's
reTurn To a human.

682
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:02,934
My TreaT.

683
01:12:34,477 --> 01:12:36,069
What are you doing, Superman?

684
01:12:37,813 --> 01:12:44,343
I can't wear my costume
'cuz I'm in hiding.

685
01:12:44,453 --> 01:12:45,886
So...

686
01:12:46,956 --> 01:12:48,685

01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:54,887
only for me To see.

689
01:12:55,164 --> 01:12:57,333
You mean like a Tattoo?

690
01:12:57,333 --> 01:13:00,496
No, iT's environmenTally friendly.

691
01:13:02,705 --> 01:13:07,005
I'll puT This on my chesT and geT

692
01:13:17,086 --> 01:13:19,350
Superman, Turn your head.

01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:28,763
This needs To be fasTened TighT.

694
01:13:30,766 --> 01:13:34,224
Look The oTher way.

Don't lose courage

698
01:14:57,186 --> 01:14:59,814
Since when did you know
you were Superman?

699
01:15:00,489 --> 01:15:02,184
Ever since I was young.

700
01:15:04,994 --> 01:15:11,399
My dad Told me
I had special powers.

701
01:15:12,835 --> 01:15:17,272
AT firsT, I haTed being differenT

BuT I knew I couldn'T run
from my desTiny.

703
01:15:24,613 --> 01:15:26,205
And your dad?

704
01:15:29,718 --> 01:15:34,883
He reTurned To KrypTon
on The nighT of The gun blasTs.

705
01:15:35,824 --> 01:15:37,485
Gun blasTs?

706
01:15:46,235 --> 01:15:47,634
Don'T worry.

707
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:50,573
- Fellow citizens of Gwang-ju!
- I'll never die.

708
01:15:50,573 --> 01:15:53,375
The villains are coming!

709
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:54,399
Help us!

710
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:56,842
His father promised he'd return

711
01:15:57,446 --> 01:16:02,543
If the boy did good things.

712
01:16:06,956 --> 01:16:08,856
And that someday...

713
01:16:10,593 --> 01:16:13,061

Be good like Superman and help others
From Dad, May 5th, 1980

715
01:16:17,299 --> 01:16:19,233

Help my daddy, please.

717
01:16:55,971 --> 01:17:00,499
And they put kryptonite
inside my head.

718
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:05,544
To make me forget
who I really am...

719
01:18:16,885 --> 01:18:18,750
Hey, folks!

720
01:18:22,524 --> 01:18:24,059

Mom?

733
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:04,978
Mommy?

734
01:21:06,622 --> 01:21:08,487
Mom?

735
01:21:32,247 --> 01:21:34,841
Help me!

736
01:21:40,656 --> 01:21:44,319

Somebody save her!

740
01:21:57,406 --> 01:21:58,896
Hee-jung!

741
01:23:02,671 --> 01:23:04,332
WaiT!

742
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,967
Can'T you hear The sirens?

743
01:23:11,213 --> 01:23:13,078
No! Don'T!

744
01:23:14,082 --> 01:23:15,572
Come To your senses!

745
01:23:20,188 --> 01:23:23,089
You're noT Superman,
Hyun-suk!

746
01:23:24,326 --> 01:23:28,092
No! If you go up There now,
you'll die!

747
01:23:35,303 --> 01:23:37,965
Doing This won'T bring Them back!

748
01:23:38,607 --> 01:23:40,768
Your family and faTher...

749
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:45,175
IT wasn'T your faulT.

750
01:23:46,982 --> 01:23:49,780
Don'T Torture yourself anymore!

751
01:23:52,554 --> 01:23:55,182
You did all ThaT you could.

752
01:23:56,458 --> 01:23:59,256
IT's Time To forgive yourself.

753
01:24:00,662 --> 01:24:03,859
This won'T geT ThaT Thing
ouT of your head!

754
01:24:03,999 --> 01:24:06,467
NoThing will change!

755
01:24:09,271 --> 01:24:11,762
The pasT can'T be changed.

756
01:24:14,409 --> 01:24:16,274
So...

757
01:24:17,245 --> 01:24:20,009
IT haunTs me everyday.

758
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,418
BuT The fuTure's differenT.

759
01:24:29,491 --> 01:24:31,356
IT can be changed.

760
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:37,496
If you don'T forgeT
who you really are.

761
01:24:40,268 --> 01:24:42,133
Who am I?

762
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,530
Tell me.

763
01:24:48,376 --> 01:24:50,207
Who am I?

764
01:24:55,517 --> 01:24:57,314
Say iT!

765
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,745

01:25:02,224 --> 01:25:03,816
You are...

767
01:25:06,995 --> 01:25:08,690
My friend...

768
01:25:14,035 --> 01:25:16,060
My Superman...

769
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:19,487
Our final mission is in here.

770
01:27:38,647 --> 01:27:40,342
Hey!

771
01:27:46,454 --> 01:27:48,513
Who am I, friend?

772
01:27:48,857 --> 01:27:50,625
Superman!

773
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:52,422
Okay!

774
01:27:53,261 --> 01:27:55,354
Okay!

775
01:28:07,776 --> 01:28:10,939
Hold on!

01:28:53,888 --> 01:28:54,980
Two.

779
01:28:57,859 --> 01:28:58,951
Three.

780
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,993
Four.

781
01:29:05,567 --> 01:29:06,625
Five.

782
01:29:09,471 --> 01:29:10,631
Six.

783
01:29:13,108 --> 01:29:14,541
Seven.

784
01:29:15,944 --> 01:29:20,404
Help me... Help me...
Please...

785
01:29:22,517 --> 01:29:24,508
Eight...

786
01:29:26,888 --> 01:29:28,947
Nine...

787
01:29:31,559 --> 01:29:33,322
Ten...

788
01:29:36,431 --> 01:29:38,524
Eleven...

789
01:29:41,202 --> 01:29:43,534
Twelve...

790
01:29:46,908 --> 01:29:48,705
Thirteen...

791
01:29:52,247 --> 01:29:54,511
Fourteen...

792
01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:07,719
Hee-jung!

793
01:30:17,605 --> 01:30:18,799
Hee-jung!

794
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:22,567
Hee-jung, Hee-jung.

795
01:30:26,247 --> 01:30:27,475
LeT's go!

796
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,096
Open your eyes.

797
01:31:26,508 --> 01:31:28,738
Don't lose courage, son.

798
01:31:30,678 --> 01:31:34,444
The future is in your hands.

799
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,345
Who am I, friend?

800
01:31:42,757 --> 01:31:44,952
Superman...

801
01:32:03,244 --> 01:32:08,773
Can Superman fly?

802
01:32:09,017 --> 01:32:10,609
Yes...

803
01:32:15,723 --> 01:32:21,958
It's time to fly
with Superman, okay?

804
01:32:22,230 --> 01:32:23,857
98...

805
01:32:26,334 --> 01:32:28,234
99...

806
01:32:30,305 --> 01:32:31,795
100!

807
01:34:34,562 --> 01:34:36,553
Help, Superman!

808
01:36:54,735 --> 01:36:56,804
Police claims the explosion
was due to...

809
01:36:56,804 --> 01:36:59,637
a leak in natural gas pipes
below a manhole.

810
01:36:59,774 --> 01:37:02,076
A brave man at the scene...

811
01:37:02,076 --> 01:37:04,078
saved several lives...

812
01:37:04,078 --> 01:37:06,814
but got severely injured
and brain-dead...

813
01:37:06,814 --> 01:37:09,408
in a devastating tragedy...

814
01:37:15,056 --> 01:37:17,251
The show's seT To air.

815
01:37:17,425 --> 01:37:19,290
How's Superman?

816
01:37:21,195 --> 01:37:22,958
Are you okay?

817
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:19,075
Soo-jung? WhaT's ThaT?

818
01:38:23,357 --> 01:38:27,123
You musT be happy.
You hiT The jackpoT.

819
01:38:32,033 --> 01:38:35,002
IT's an organ donor card.

820
01:40:20,741 --> 01:40:25,872
After saving 12 more lives,
he left the earth.

821
01:40:45,599 --> 01:40:48,329
Goodbye Superman.

822
01:40:52,473 --> 01:40:56,034
Goodbye friends.

823
01:41:05,820 --> 01:41:09,023
'Superman' was released on
March 31st, 1979 in Korea

824
01:41:09,023 --> 01:41:12,526
LEE Hyun- suk was shot on the head
on May 27th, 1980 outside his house

825
01:41:12,526 --> 01:41:15,791
He gained consciousness a month later
despite claims he won't survive

826
01:41:16,497 --> 01:41:22,595
He lived 27 years longer,
suffering from epilepsy his entire life

827
01:41:24,605 --> 01:41:29,702
And in his final year,
he lived as Superman.

828
01:42:00,774 --> 01:42:05,643
Strength doesn't open big iron doors
but a small key.

829
01:42:06,413 --> 01:42:09,712
We all have the key inside us...

830
01:42:11,719 --> 01:42:15,120
To open the door to
a new future...
