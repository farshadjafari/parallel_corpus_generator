2
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,959
Agent Cortez? This is Danger D'Amo.

3
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,873
Give me a status update.

4
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,465
Visual ID has been made.

5
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,722
The subject has entered
the location right on time.

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,054
be on the alert.

7
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:55,102
Subject known as Tick Tock has the
stolen OSS mini disc.

8
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,643
Alpha and Bravo teams,
move in to apprehend the target.

9
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,064
Freeze!

10
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,402
He's got time bombs!

11
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,533
Be careful what you wish for!

12
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,784
Tick Tock has the stolen
OSS mini disc and is on the move.

13
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,998
Sorry I can't hang around.

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,164
On-site arrival in four minutes.

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,083
We don't have four minutes!
I'll get him faster with the zip line.

16
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,088
If I don't catch him now, who knows
how many people he'll freeze?

17
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,677
17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,342
You're pregnant.

19
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,012
Yeah, well, they say you can exercise
up until the last day of pregnancy,

20
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,350
so, here we go.

21
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,356
21
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,815
- Contraction!

23
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,321
You're about to become a mom.

24
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,857
All the more reason
to get the job done now.

25
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,361
We can't let Tick Took escape again.

26
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,203
26
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,207
- Breathe.

28
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,626
- Try not to hit that bus.

29
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,509
- Mute road noise.

30
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,594
- Call Wilbur.
- Calling husband.

31
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,681
Oh, there she is. How's my girl?

32
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,394
You just leaving work?

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,973
Yeah, just tying up a few things.

34
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,685
Nine months pregnant
and still working around the clock.

35
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,402
You've got to be the most dedicated
interior decorator that ever lived.

36
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,737
What can I say? I love my work.

37
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,368
- Ooh!

38
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,862
Here's what I really called about.

39
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,082
Guess who decided
to pay us an early visit?

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,036
Is this it?

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,911
I'm on my way to the hospital.
Meet me there?

42
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,252
Right. Hospital. Don't panic.
I'm here for you.

43
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,167
- All you have to do...

44
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,713
...is breathe easy and breathe often...

45
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,176
45
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,718

47
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,601
I love you so... much.

48
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:02,853
Keep breathing.

49
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,018
- You're gonna be just fine.
- Yep. Gotcha. See you there.

50
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,073
50
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,119
Wait for backup!

52
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,878
Contractions are only

53
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,128
53
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,479
OK, Tick Tock. Hand over the mini disc.

55
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,766
- Ah, man.

56
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,980
Don't underestimate her.

57
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,646
- I think my water just broke.

58
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,690
I hope that was my water.

59
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,572
Clean her clock.

60
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,874
Cut me some slack,
I'm having a contraction.

61
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,629
- Congratulations...

62
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,250
62
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,837

64
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,089
64
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,937
I look forward to doing this again.

66
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,310
Swell work, Agent Cortez.

67
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,727
Aces. I knew you had it in you.

68
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,904
If this got into the wrong hands,

69
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,486
our world would've
stopped in its tracks.

70
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,867
Looks like an old OSS file.

71
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,624
the ultimate weapon.

72
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,878
This baby not only takes out
your enemy, it takes out everyone.

73
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:50,132
No one ever notices time
until it's gone.

74
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,629
74
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,889
This was our agreement.

76
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,516
One last mission and I'm out for good.

77
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,143
You're really gonna take a powder
on us? Leave us high and dry?

78
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,805
No more dangling from zip lines
or high-speed chases.

79
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,518
My family needs me now.

80
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,354
And they can never know I was a spy.

81
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,646
I respect that, agent. But a word
of advice: tell 'em who you are.

82
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,610
Life's too short for secrets.

83
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,109
Push out a good one, a nice little
fire-breather for us, all right?

84
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,243
The future of the OSS depends on it.

85
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,030
Let's not stand around
bumping gums, people.

86
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,453
I wanna figure out what
makes Tick Tock tick.

87
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,501
87
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,503
Go.

89
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:38,093
Hey, kids. I got a new idea
for a reality show.

90
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,178
It's called
Wilbur Wilson: Spy Hunter

91
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,015
where I hunt real spies on TV.

92
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,930
- What do you think?
- Uh, it's pretty out there, Dad.

93
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,436
- Got you.

94
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:54,025
One point for me. Yeah, I mean,
where are you gonna find a spy?

95
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,111
- Hi! Honey!
- Hey, sweetheart!

96
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,947
Hey, you look great.

97
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,118
You owe me a dollar.

98
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,873
Told you we would get here before her.

99
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,908
I said take it slow, but that was
a night shy of eternity

100
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,292
and a morning past forever.

101
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,874
Stepmother is always
late for everything.

102
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,792
Technically I'm early, 'cause the baby
wasn't even due until tomorrow.

103
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:15,959
Ease up.

104
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,423
What took so long?

105
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,260
Uh, just must have lost track of time.

106
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,641
- Here we go! Oh!

107
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,893
Jeez! Guys, guys, guys, guys.

108
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,429
From this point on,
everything'll be different.

109
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,143
In a good way, right?

110
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,308
Yeah. And you'll have
a new baby sister

111
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,479
- in five, four, three, two...

112
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,739
112
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,790

114
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,000
I put my life on the line

115
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,793
every time I search for...

116
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,132
...the spies among us.

117
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,474
Look!

118
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,432
I'm Wilbur Wilson...

119
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,221
...Spy Hunter.

120
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,185
Mondays after your local news.

121
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,770
121
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,519
Last piece of bacon.

123
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,021
123
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,656

125
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,365
Is the baby throwing food again?

126
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,369
- I would say so.

127
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,124
Can you watch her, please?

128
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,628
I have to go change again.

129
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,538
Again.

130
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,503
- Ah! Seriously?

131
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,045
Her gas bombs are gonna
take the paint right off this house.

132
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,888
- You watch her.
- No. You.

133
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,890
- Breath-holding contest?
- You're on.

134
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,346
134
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,728

136
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,351
One point for me.

137
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,892
- Good morning, little Spy Hunters.

138
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,651
Do you have time
to eat breakfast with us?

139
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,278
- I sure do.
- Yes!

140
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,315
No, I don't.

141
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,819
I swear I had an extra five minutes...

142
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,453
...just a few minutes ago.

143
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,204
- Where'd the time go?

144
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,409
You owe me a dollar.

145
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,921
Hey...
Do you remember our five-year plan?

146
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,753
If my show does well,

147
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,589
then I'll have all
the time in the world

148
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,472
to spend with you and you, OK?

149
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,598
Meanwhile, time is just slipping away.

150
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,851
- Morning, honey.
- Oh, bye, honey.

151
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,763
- I gotta get to work.
- Oh, um, OK.

152
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,273
- Uh, good-bye hug?
- Oh, yeah.

153
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,060
Uh...

154
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,196
- Bye.
- Bye.

155
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,574
- Rebecca, behave at school. OK?
- I know.

156
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,827
And, Cecil, uh...

157
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,449
...feed the dog.

158
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,284
He doesn't really eat.

159
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,745
He just watches us.

160
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,409
Here, Argonaut.

161
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,630
It's kind of creepy.

162
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,628
Time is speeding up.

163
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,173
You're not cranking my chain, are you?
This is on the up and up?

164
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,304
- Good night?

165
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,186
What are you talking about, doll face?
You just got back from lunch.

166
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,223
- But it's five o'clock, sir.
- Five o'clock?

167
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,061
167
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,980
We're running out of time.

169
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,494
and jelly sandwich in your face

170
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,279
and then he stole your homework?

171
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:35,246
Technically, it was his homework.
I was just doing it for him.

172
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,503
And what about you, Miss Rebecca?
How was your day?

173
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,914
Same old, same old.

174
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,749
- So I heard.

175
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,964
The principal called me
about your pranks.

176
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,174
- Hey, kids!
- Dad! Come, sit by me!

177
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:51,183
Sorry, kids, but I have to go write up
this report before I can do anything.

178
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,718
Save me some leftovers.

179
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:56,184
Hey, Dad? Can you teach me
how to be a Spy Hunter?

180
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,691
Well, there's always time for that.

181
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,318
OK. Repeat after me:

182
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,071
"I'm Cecil Wilson, Spy Hunter,

183
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,235
and I'll catch you... later."

184
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,203
I'm Cecil Wilson, Spy Hunter,

185
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,866
and I'll catch you... later!

186
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,034
Here's the important part.

187
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,370
Lift the eyebrow.

188
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,715
Respect the golden arch.

189
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,217
That's my secret.

190
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,470
How many spies have you caught?

191
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,557
Um... Well, none.

192
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,309
Um... But that's not really
what the show's about.

193
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,846
So you're not
a spy-catching superhero?

194
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,390
194
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,104
_..but.._

196
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,068
How's my girl?

197
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,025
She made two poopies today.

198
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,906
Two poopies?
She's six away from the house record.

199
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,157
- Oh!

200
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,068
200
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,487

202
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,205
I lost my appetite.

203
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,912
I'll go talk to her.

204
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,920
What am I doing wrong?

205
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,255
I've tried so hard
to connect with her

206
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,171
- but she just hates me.
- No, she doesn't hate you.

207
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,841
- She totally hates me.
- No, she doesn't. Maybe a little.

208
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,430
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

209
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,348
I think she's just trying
to adjust to a new situation.

210
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,021
We've been married for two years.

211
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,935
Right.

212
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,729
212
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,648
ever since Stepmother
entered the picture.

214
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,738
And she's keeping something from us.

215
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,948
I can feel it.
She's not who she says she is!

216
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,458
You don't think she's
really an interior decorator?

217
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,588
Well, look at this place!
She's obviously evil.

218
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,248
Well, I think she's nice.

219
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,463
There is something
she's hiding from us.

220
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,470
Doesn't mean she deserves
your blue cheese dressing bomb.

221
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,303
My best prank yet.

222
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,139
Not hearing very well
increased my other senses.

223
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,895
223
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,058
Don't worry, she never
comes into my room anyway.

225
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,939
Do you have a sec?

226
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,104
Yes.

227
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,863
I was going through the basement

228
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:15,277
and I found somethings
that I thought you might wanna have.

229
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,914
Mom.

230
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:29,671
I know you miss your mom
and I could never replace her.

231
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:35,343
I just would really like it
if maybe we could be friends?

232
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,429
Mom always said
she loved my practical jokes.

233
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,686
I love your practical jokes.
I think you're hilarious.

234
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,061
You think I'm funny?

235
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,315
The one you did last month
to your father

236
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,568
when you filled his toothpaste
with blueberry filling?

237
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,195
And his teeth were blue
for like four days.

238
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,152
That was epic.

239
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,988
I hooked up his nose hair clipper

240
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,823
- to a power saw?

241
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,784
Some of my best work.

242
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,369
Or the baby powder
in the hair dryer trick?

243
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,463
I had meant that prank for you.

244
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,875
I know.

245
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,468
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,629
It's OK. It was just a joke.

247
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,548
There's something, um...

248
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,014
...I would like you to have.

249
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:27,732
This is something my parents gave me
when I was around your age.

250
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,814
And my mother said
it would always protect me,

251
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,150
even in my darkest hour.

252
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,815
What I think she meant by that was,

253
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,156
I would always have
her love and support.

254
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,285
You're really giving this to me?

255
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,203
It's something that's
very special to me and my family

256
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,791
and I want you to have it...

257
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,884
...because you're so very special.

258
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,091
Rebecca. _ _

259
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,223
...I'm really looking forward
to us being friends.

260
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,266
MS, too.

261
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,761
Good night.

262
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:19,780
Marissa, wait!

263
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,787
263
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,378
I'm so...

265
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,672
...sorry.

266
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,641
Good going.

267
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,436
I tried to warn her!

268
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,646
You got to make it up to her.

269
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,149
Why do I have to be the one
to always apologize?

270
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,277
Like what about that time that you
just kept on talking and I was...

271
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,314
271
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,858
I turned off my hearing aids.

273
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,579
273
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,328
OK! I'll make it up to her!

275
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,589
He's right, you know.

276
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,000
I mean, the show is called Spy Hunter.

277
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,669
At some point,
I should actually catch a spy.

278
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,179
He thinks I'm a complete loser.

279
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,590
That's not what he meant.

280
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,009
They just wanna spend
more time with you.

281
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,644
What is that smell?

282
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,350
Oh, did the baby spit up on you again?

283
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,015
- Something like that.

284
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,650
...Our worst fears have been confirmed.

285
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,939
According to scientists, there are now,
literally, less hours in the day.

286
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,325
Studies show that time is running out.

287
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,450
Time is speeding up.

288
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,453
At first, we were losing nanoseconds,
but now we're losing hours.

289
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,957
By tomorrow, we'll have lost days.
By the day after that, a year.

290
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,871
At this rate, we will be
completely out of time... in no time.

291
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,539
Experts are divided
on what's causing this phenomenon,

292
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:01,678
although one man has claimed credit.
We received this video moments ago.

293
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,838
Citizens of the world,

294
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:08,806
I find you all guilty of wasting time.

295
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,939
You fill your days
with meaningless pursuits

296
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,273
instead of treasuring moments
with those you love.

297
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,063
You will no longer
take time for granted,

298
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:25,201
for I am taking all
of the time in the world from you.

299
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,158
Project Armageddon
has been activated

300
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:33,623
and I will continue to speed up time
until time runs out,

301
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,537
and the world will end.

302
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,082
I am the Time Keeper

303
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,594
and I want more time!

304
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:47,223
Only minutes ago, OSS Director
Danger D'Amo addressed the threat.

305
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:51,056
The OSS will find this Time Keeper,
and when we do,

306
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,892
we will punch his clock.

307
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,603
There 's a decrease of one minute
per hour as now...

308
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,064
308
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,570
Oh, this is not good.

310
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,355
Actually, this is awesome.

311
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,274
Could you imagine
the promotion I would get

312
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,284
if I landed an interview with this guy,
the Time Holder?

313
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,445
- Time Keeper.
- Not to mention the hero factor

314
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:13,207
for tracking down an international
supervillain. Not too shabby.

315
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,915
Honey, I think being a hero isn't really
what the kids need from you right now.

316
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,954
It's just what they need now.

317
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,123
It's what the world needs.

318
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,338
318
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,890
Where is the Chronos Sapphire
you promised me?

320
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,177
Time waits for no man, no man but me.

321
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,187
That one little rock
is the only element

322
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,974
that can stop the Armageddon device.

323
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,438
Trust me, it will be ours.

324
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,820
Time and my temper are short.

325
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,947
You waste my time...

326
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,900
...and I'll waste you.

327
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,042
We will find the Chronos Sapphire...

328
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,751
...and when we do...

329
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,002
329
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,835
...no one will be able to stop us.

331
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,046
331
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,927
NO One.

333
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,849
OK, princess.
You're a little sleepy head, huh?

334
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,729
334
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,184
Oh, no.

336
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,199
OSS directive. For your eyes only.

337
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,325
Time Keeper threat confirmed.

338
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,159
Chronos Sapphire
needed to stop Armageddon.

339
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,326
Deliver Chronos to OSS immediately.

340
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,702
Oh, Rebecca.

341
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,292
I hope you're working on that apology.

342
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,584
Make sure you write
"P.S., Cecil is innocent."

343
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,422
A handmade coupon,

344
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,680
good for one free month
of all household chores.

345
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,058
And no pranks for a whole month.

346
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,641
"And no pranks for a week."

347
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,064
Hey, Rebecca?

348
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,318
Do you have that necklace
from last night?

349
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,649
Yeah. Why?

350
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,734
I was just wondering
if maybe I could, um...

351
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,569
...maybe I can have it back?

352
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,735
You want the necklace back?

353
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:17,703
I realized it needs to be cleaned,
and, uh... you know, it's old.

354
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,540
Oh, I get it.
You can't trust me with it.

355
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,335
What happened to "This necklace
is so special, and so are you"?

356
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,250
Am I supposed to pretend
that you really meant that?

357
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,046
I just need the necklace back.
I can't really explain it right now.

358
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,926
You can have it!

359
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,683
I never wanted your
stupid necklace anyway.

360
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,934
You only care about yourself!
You don't care about us at all!

361
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,279
I have to go on an important mission,
I mean, errand.

362
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,819
There are snacks in the fridge.

363
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,828
I'll be back in ten minutes.

364
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,330
Do you guys need anything?

365
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,123
My mom.

366
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,631
We'll be fine.

367
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,379
Right.

368
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,466
Argonaut.

369
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,470
Watch the kids.

370
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,736
House is now armed.

371
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,867
Buckle up, baby.

372
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,203
- All right.

373
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,830
Let's go for a ride.

374
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,508
Hey! I thought you
gave that back to Marissa.

375
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,010
Wait till she looks in the box.

376
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,012
376
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,844

378
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,384
Is that the Chronos Sapphire?
Without that, our goose is cooked.

379
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,178
Give it to Mommy. Thank you, pumpkin.

380
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,848
Here, give it to me.

381
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,151
381
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,858
Another prank.

383
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,157
- Baby food.
- I'm sorry.

384
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,365
My stepdaughter is a little... upset.

385
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,699
She has the necklace.

386
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,536
- I can get it back.
- Chronos Sapphire can wait.

387
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,371
Your old pallie Tick Tock
has just been made

388
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,830
and you're the only one
that can scoop him up.

389
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,961
Pop the clutch.
You're back on the clock.

390
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,497
What about the Chronos?

391
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,007
You nab Tick Tock,
he'll lead us to the Time Keeper.

392
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,543
We don't need the Chronos.

393
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,711
So Rebecca can keep the necklace.

394
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,260
It would mean a lot if she could.

395
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,642
OK. I'll do it.
I just have to go get my kids first.

396
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,394
Those ankle biters'll be fine!

397
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,067
This is Seeker 17. We have a lock
on the Chronos Sapphire.

398
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,528
Repeat, we have found
the Chronos Sapphire.

399
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,364
Prepare to breach the entrance.

400
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,123
400
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,869
You really shouldn't do that.

402
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,585
But if you're going to,
give her vampire teeth.

403
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,047
subject to immediate attack.

404
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,632
Please take shelter
in the panic room now.

405
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:20,765
You're really stepping up your game
with these pranks.

406
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,095
That's not my prank.

407
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,262
subject to immediate attack.

408
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,771
Take shelter in the panic room now.

409
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,854
- Where's the panic room?
- Don't fall for it.

410
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,691
This is obviously Marissa's
attempt to get me back.

411
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,944
Take shelter in the panic room now.

412
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:42,157
Oh, and if we don't, I suppose
something really terrible

413
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,821
will happen to us.

414
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,251
414
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,287

416
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,545
Scanning.

417
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:58,128
Identity match.
Please enter the panic room now.

418
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,142
- Enter the panic room now.
- Let's go, Rebecca.

419
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,395
Enter the panic room now.

420
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,640
420
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,903

422
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,856
Well, this is obviously the panic room.

423
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:22,948
- Why?
- 'Cause it's a room, and I'm panicking.

424
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,333
Hello, children.

425
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,335
I had this panic room installed
when I married your father

426
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,917
in the event that my work
ever put the family in danger.

427
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,332
Her work?

428
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,171
There 's something
I never told you about myself

429
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,008
because it was a matter
of national security.

430
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,506
I am a spy.

431
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,471
Our stepmother's a spy?

432
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,011
Impossible.

433
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,770
She's not cool enough.

434
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,647
434
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,024
Argonaut is an Advanced Robotic
Guardian Operative

436
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,655
designed to protect you.

437
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,156
I still think this is a prank.

438
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,817
438
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,536
The dog is talking.

440
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,363
440
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,874
Well, it's not the sort of thing
you'd miss, is it, really?

442
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:16,039
A small, handsome dog talking with
an English accent, like James Bond.

443
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,683
Anyway, I've been assigned
to protect you, so give me five.

444
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,558
That's what cool people say, isn't it?
Anyway, let's shake hands.

445
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,722
Hello. How do you do?

446
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,063
Ah! Oh, no! I hate when that happens!
I am gonna need that back.

447
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,729
447
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,193
I think you better keep it
in sentry mode.

449
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,824
any time you're ready.

450
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,906
- Good thinking.

451
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,116
Can I have it back now?
'Cause I am gonna fall over.

452
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,920
The panic room is being attacked.

453
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,550
You must leave now.

454
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,011
The jet luges will take you
to OSS headquarters.

455
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,047
And sit. Do you get it?

456
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,308
It's what humans usually say to dogs.

457
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,472
I reversed it, I flipped it.

458
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,312
Oh, this is gonna be great.

459
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,063
- I tell you, we're gonna have a...

460
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,521
460
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:25,942
I usually have to eat grass
or a slipper to feel this sick. Oh.

462
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:29,157
I wasn't ready, that's all.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

463
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,120
463
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,511
Do not let the
Chronos Sapphire get away!

465
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,847
A mini camera is not
that impressive any more.

466
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,016
People have them in their phones.

467
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,314
Well, how small is it?

468
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,821
- That's impossible.

469
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,657
Sorry. What?

470
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,904
470
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,991
Sorry, there was an air show
behind me.

472
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,372
There's no such thing
as invisibility powder.

473
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,249
All right, Argonaut. Start talking.

474
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,287
Who were those guys with the
giant goggles? What do they want?

475
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:20,875
How long has Marissa been a spy?

476
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,087
OK. Your stepmom will answer
all of your questions post-mission.

477
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,672
I have a question.
Who's flying this thing?

478
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,128
I thought you were.

479
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,174
Oh, no.
They do not look like pet lovers.

480
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,686
Hello, children. if you're watching
this, your escape jets are under attack.

481
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,938
We are going to have to initiate
evasive maneuvers

482
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,316
to get you to OSS even faster.

483
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,851
- Brace yourselves.
- Oh, great.

484
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,361
484
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,034
It's like a big video game.

486
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,697
Grab your controller and steer slowly!

487
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,867
- Whoa!
- I'm gonna crash!

488
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,829
I'm gonna hurl.

489
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,214
Right.
Puke goes in the bag, not on my fur.

490
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,626
490
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,133
They're gaining!

492
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,097
492
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,731
Cecil!

494
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,820
Do something!

495
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,981
He is doing something. He's puking.

496
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,570
We might need a bigger bag.

497
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,734
In fact, we might
need a bigger spaceship.

498
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,745
It smells like fish socks in here.
Can we at least open a window?

499
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,453
Ugh. it's not much fun in here.

500
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,831
Hey! You opened up mine!

501
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,838
Fresh air. That helps.

502
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,967
I love this. I love sticking my head
out the window. it's my favorite thing.

503
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,091
503
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,646

505
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,521
Sorry!

506
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,691
Cecil!
How may puke bags do you have left?

507
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,490
507
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,625

509
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,715
509
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,710
Good job, Cecil!

511
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,468
Never underestimate the power of puke.

512
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,769
Agent Argonaut reporting.

513
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,851
Listen, the kids are fine.

514
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,765
I can't say the same about the house.

515
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,354
Why? What did they do?

516
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,315
They didn't do anything. They didn't
destroy the house. Tick Tock's men did.

517
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,697
What?! Argonaut,
I told you to watch them!

518
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,153
I am watching them.
I'm watching them puke and scream.

519
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,286
- We've gotta discuss hazard pay.
- Just get them to the OSS.

520
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,491
I want a raise!

521
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,994
There's only one person
I want waiting there to greet them.

522
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,284
OSS Headquarters.
How can I direct your call?

523
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,999
I saved your life. One point for me.

524
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,664
Whatever. The puke bags were my idea.

525
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,583
everything? You're brother and sister.

526
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,593
You're fighting like cats and dogs,

527
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,005
which I could understand
why cats and dogs fight.

528
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,015
Cats are awful. Just chillax.

529
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:23,304
Part "chill," part "relax."
I fused 'em to make a trendy word.

530
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,351
530
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,406

532
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,535
Who are you?

533
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,869
Carmen Cortez,
secret agent of the OSS.

534
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,705
Your stepmom is my aunt.

535
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:50,460
So, a word of caution to you
would-be supervillains out there...

536
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,923
Your best defense may be...
a jelly donut.

537
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,304
What am I saying?
What are they gonna do with that?

538
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,682
What, are they gonna
throw them at 'em?

539
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,224
Just say it. I'm too attractive.

540
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,187
Let's face it.

541
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,145
I've never caught a spy,
and I probably never will.

542
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,152
I say we go after the Time Keeper.

543
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,733
Oh, that's realistic.

544
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,068
Where are you at with
that piece for Spy Week?

545
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,403
It's not due till Friday.

546
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,909
It is Friday.

547
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,695
Time's speeding up, Wilson.
Don't you keep up with the news?

548
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,241
Get me something on someone, anyone!

549
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,500
And get it to me yesterday

550
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,458
or there won't be a tomorrow
for you at the station. Got it?

551
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,427
It's time to get serious.

552
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,883
Marissa's not picking up.
Maybe she's under radio silence.

553
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,222
She's got a lot
of explaining to do, man.

554
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,762
She never told you she was a spy, huh?

555
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,724
Well, in her defense, she was retired.

556
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,860
- Well, hello.

557
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,363
You're a big girl now.
Is that titanium alloy?

558
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,273
- Treat?
- Yes, please.

559
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,869
559
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,618
Cool.

561
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,211
Wanna see how I got started as a spy?

562
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,378
562
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:23,841
This is the old Spy Kids division.

564
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,057
564
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,109
ago due to budget cuts.

566
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,862
Really sad. It was ahead of its time.

567
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,909
Spy Kids were an elite
juvenile division of the OSS.

568
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,321
I'm going to explode you.

569
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,535
Established to go where
adult spies couldn't go

570
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,325
and do what ordinary spies
couldn't do.

571
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,291
Ralphie, it's me!
We went to the academy together.

572
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,420
How you do...

573
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,800
Oh. Now I see what, they've turned
him off. Just as well. He's annoying.

574
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,462
I'd like to bring back
the Spy Kids division one day.

575
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,304
We call those Stompers
and Hammer Hands.

576
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:10,016
They use electron fields
to create superhuman impact force.

577
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,725
These SFS 3WeSOI'T1€.

578
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,606
You can crush things.

579
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,435
579
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,605
on-the-spot booby traps

581
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,617
ambushes, mass confusion,
and pranks.

582
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,244
- Pranks?
- I'll tell you what.

583
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,122
I'll let you guys pick out
one gadget each as a souvenir.

584
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,874
- Mine.
- Mine.

585
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,751
Don't get too excited. I said that
I'd let you guys pick out e gadget,

586
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,457
but I didn't say I'd activate it.

587
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,214
Back in the day,
the kids who made the best spies

588
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,001
were the ones who didn't wait around
for the perfect gadgets.

589
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:44,297
They made stuff happen
with what they had on hand.

590
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,181
Who's that?

591
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,683
Me and my brother, Juni.

592
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,150
We were the first and last
of the Spy Kids program.

593
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,106
593
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,446
We shall not speak of him. Let's go.

595
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,247
And this is where our grand tour ends.

596
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,533
Wait here. Marissa will
pick you guys up in a minute.

597
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,202
Can we be candidates
for the new Spy Kids program?

598
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,087
Time will tell. Sorry, guys, gotta go.

599
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,499
OSS has us working around the clock.

600
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:25,588
We have to stop the Time Keeper
before the Time Keeper stops time.

601
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:29,224
much of a villain's name, is it?

602
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,680
Oh, the Time Keeper.
Has he got a watch, has he?

603
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,062
It's not a scary name at all.

604
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,564
Rubbish.

605
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,782
605
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,510
your destination for this mission.

607
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,137
Good luck, agent.

608
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:10,094
So Tick Tock attacked our house

609
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,510
and chased after your
brother and sister.

610
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,477
What do you think we should do?

611
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,013
Annihilate.

612
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,560
Annihilate?
Good thinking.

613
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,978
to the big-time, agent. Suit up.

614
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,897
Intel places Tick Tock at this location.

615
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,989
Spot him and let him lead us to
the Time Keeper's Armageddon device.

616
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,995
Then call in and wait for backup.

617
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,207
617
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,960
I need you at six o'clock, right here.

619
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,501
Come on! Bring it in.

620
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,386
The Armageddon device
will be here any minute

621
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,970
and we must be ready for its arrival!

622
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,637
Uh, cover the exit.

623
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,848
There you go. Good work.

624
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,184
Focus up, focus. Focus!

625
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,815
What are you doing?
We're moments away.

626
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,648
My plan is almost complete.

627
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,656
I just need to get the Chronos
back from those meddlesome kids.

628
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,331
628
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,584
Shh...

630
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,381
Oh! Are you kidding me? Is that you?

631
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,382
Did you drop your transmission?

632
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,044
Oh, my God. Gentlemen, please.

633
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,134
That smells like lentils
and desperation.

634
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:35,722
My God, that's mental.
It's following you.

635
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,512
Get back on your marks. Focus.

636
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:41,557
I'm blinded. OW!

637
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,647
It's here, it's here. it's finally here.

638
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:50,066
Places, everyone. This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

639
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,569
Right on time.

640
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,535
Hickory-dickory dock.

641
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,416
The spy ran up the clock.

642
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,250
The clock struck one,
and the spy was done.

643
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,585
Game, set, and match, Tick Tock.

644
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,922
Wait a minute. Hold on.

645
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:13,089
This is your sidekick?
A nose-picking baby?

646
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,256
Gentlemen, get in here.

647
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,594
Baby, looks like we've been set up.

648
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,558
Finish her. Boom.

649
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:22,514
Boom.

650
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,851
650
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,193

652
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,748
Better luck next time!

653
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:47,832
The bigger the crime,
the better the time!

654
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,630
He is really starting to tick me off.

655
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,261
655
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,883
J" Ten green bottles hanging on a wall

657
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,973
J" Ten green bottles hanging on a wall

658
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,559
J* And if one green bottle
should accidentally fall J'

659
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,724
I'm still mad at Stepmother...

660
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,312
Marissa.

661
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,853
...For not telling us she was a spy.

662
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,441
For not telling Dad.

663
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,608
Maybe she quit
to make more time for us.

664
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:15,900
Yeah, right.

665
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,570
Well, wouldn't you wanna be a spy?

666
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,243
I will be.

667
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,704
Even better spy than Marissa.

668
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,161
What are you up to?

669
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,257
Carmen said that the best Spy Kids
were the ones who didn't wait around.

670
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,134
They went out and made stuff happen.

671
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,671
It would have to be
something really amazing.

672
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,141
- Like catching the Time Keeper?
- Bad idea.

673
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,803
First person to get the bad guy wins.

674
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,812
No. Not another competi...

675
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,145
What part of "chillax"
don't you understand?

676
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:49,726
Game on.

677
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,195
Aw, man!

678
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,281
This Electric Shock Gumball
doesn't work, either.

679
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:04,325
While you're chewing gum over there,
I'm hacking into my Hammer Hands.

680
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,585
- I think I got it!

681
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,174
- OW!

682
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:15,756
682
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,880
Why?

684
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,388
I just don't understand.

685
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,807
It says batteries are included.

686
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,018
Read the fine print.

687
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:33,232
"On and off button...

688
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,816
...not included."

689
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,614
Let's get out of here.

690
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,697
Good idea.

691
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,491
- Hey!
- Hey!

692
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:51,080
What are you kids doing? You don't
have security clearance to be out here.

693
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:53,214
Um... We lost our dog.

694
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,419
Yeah, but we just found him. See?

695
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,839
Hello. I mean, bark.
I mean, woof, woof.

696
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,757
- Definitely, I meant...

697
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:06,178
Yeah, they're not falling for it.
Looks we're all in this together now.

698
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,937
Run!

699
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,432
- Hey!
- Hey! Stop right there!

700
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,192
Coming through. Nice shoes.

701
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,653
- Oh!
- Sorry, sorry.

702
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,774
Stop those kids!

703
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,614
- We'll never outrun them!

704
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,871
Yes, we will! Pull my collar!

705
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,954
- Oil slick.

706
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:34,456
706
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,296
Uh-oh.

708
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,964
- They're still after us!
- Pull my tail.

709
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,554
Butt bombs.

710
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:55,898
This is the coolest dog ever!

711
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,939
That's an award and I accept it.

712
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,404
712
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,704
Wait, wait, one more. One more.

714
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,908
Pull my finger.

715
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,457
Do it.

716
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,804
- Wait for it.

717
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,677
717
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,184
What was that supposed to do?

719
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,686
It just makes me laugh.

720
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,347
720
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,515
Silent but lethal.

722
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,564
How are we gonna
find the Time Keeper?

723
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,697
I don't know, if it was that hard
just getting out of the lounge.

724
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:45,031
Organism Oscillation Transporter...

725
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,072
...otherwise known as TOOT.

726
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,375
Carmen said not to rely on our gadgets,
but to use our heads.

727
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,416
Argonaut, what do you know
about the Time Keeper?

728
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,376
First, type in my passcode.

729
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,040
Double-0-Woof.

730
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,208
730
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,093
They've intercepted
several coded messages

732
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,719
as to the Time Keeper's location.

733
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,506
But no one's been able
to crack the code.

734
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,179
It's not a code. it's an anagram.

735
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,719
Drop all the numbers,

736
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:14,355
switch all the letters around,
and it spells something else.

737
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,063
"Big Time Watch Repair Shop"?

738
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,479
The bad guy is holding the
world hostage from a watch shop?

739
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,522
Well, he is called the Time Keeper.

740
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:25,863
Villains do love their
secret hideouts to have a theme.

741
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,993
to the Time Keeper's shop

742
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,120
without having to leave the building.

743
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,078
You better not disintegrate us.

744
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,259
- I think that's sort of the point.
- What?

745
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,171
They took the Chronos Sapphire.
Don't let them get away!

746
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,013
You vaporized us!

747
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,849
747
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,149
I've lost face.

749
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,734
Something stinks around here.

750
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,071
I always knew you were a butthead.

751
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,109
751
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:11,780
I'd give you a knuckle sandwich
if I knew where my knuckles were!

753
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,244
753
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,750

755
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,962
755
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,673
Oh, I think my stomach is inside out.

757
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,803
I think I'm missing a kidney.

758
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,423
758
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,721

760
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,306
I'm just pulling your leg.

761
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,522
- Brilliant.
- A comedian.

762
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,099
762
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,936
- Marissa's on the line.
- Marissa?

764
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,820
764
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,481
- Hello?
- Give Mommy the comlink.

766
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,695
There we go. Thank you.

767
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,950
Sorry, technical difficulties, Carmen.
How are the kids?

768
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,781
They're, uh...

769
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:55,948
...lnapping?

770
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,994
OK. Where are they really?

771
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,457
I'm really sorry. They TOOTED
themselves out of the OSS.

772
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,967
Send me their coordinates.
I'll meet you there.

773
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,636
You know, she's a lot like you, Carmen.

774
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,765
That's what I'm afraid of.

775
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,676
775
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,684
Are you sure this is the place?

777
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,228
He's called the Time Keeper.

778
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,022
This is a room full of clocks.

779
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,783
Nah, let's go, let's check out
that cheese shop across the road.

780
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,535
It's another anagram.

781
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,412
Switch all those letters around
and what do they spell?

782
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,699
782
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,583
- Elevator.

784
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,369
784
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,835
This must be the access panel.

786
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,216
- Oops.

787
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,051
787
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,712

789
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,631
- You could help, genius.
- And risk losing?

790
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,722
790
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,976
before we call you the winner.

792
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,814
You should have a competition to see
which one of you is the most annoying.

793
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,066
793
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,701
All my own stunts, all my own stunts.

795
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,748
And it's... a giant clock.

796
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,427
796
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,593

798
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,428
798
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,763

800
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,473
So, what's...

801
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,352
_..that?

802
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,983
the cut-you-in-half hand.

803
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,529
803
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,495
- Well, I'm going home.
- There's a door over there!

805
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,790
So?

806
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,126
First person to get across
without getting smushed...

807
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,128
...wins.

808
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,051
Now, listen, just because
one person jumps off a cliff,

809
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,887
it doesn't mean you have
to follow them. Does it?

810
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,759
Oh, it does, apparently.

811
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,220
Brilliant. Here we go again.

812
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,141
Here comes the cut-you-in-half hand!

813
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,810
- Jump!
- I'll duck, thank you very much.

814
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,486
Whoa!

815
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,986
There's gotta be
a better way to pass the time.

816
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,119
It's moving faster!

817
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,279
That's because time is speeding up!

818
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,163
Listen, I was told to watch you kids,
but not watch you die!

819
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,543
819
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:49,339
Cecil! Hang on!

821
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,340
Now this is fun to watch.

822
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,501
822
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:55,261

824
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,262
824
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,923

826
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:02,977
- You OK?
- Yeah.

827
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,560
I win.
One point for me.

828
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,523
- OW.
- Come on. This way.

829
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:19,240
- Hey... Hey, it's working!

830
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,029
Sweet.

831
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,914
I Spy 8 SPY-

832
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,167
Go get the camera.

833
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,836
It's show time.

834
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,041
My five-year plan is coming together.

835
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,210
This is my big break.

836
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:40,848
Now we just build on this success
and maybe someday hit primetime.

837
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:45,057
Primetime means free time...
to spend with my kids.

838
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,268
Great plan. Only in five years,
they won't be kids any more.

839
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,349
What are you saying?

840
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,234
Spend the time now.

841
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,816
'Cause the one thing
you'll always find time for later...

842
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,155
...is regret.

843
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,569
843
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,573
Jeez.

845
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:09,077
cut in half for a computer?

846
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,165
- There's a lot here about...

847
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,759
"The Boy Trapped In Time."

848
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,421
And that's gonna happen to us
if we don't stop the Time Keeper.

849
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,091
According to this, he was part
of a time travel experiment.

850
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,601
850
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,980
People sure did talk funny back then.

852
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:33,275
852
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,529
Test Footage, 1936.

854
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:41,989
Chronos Sapphire, discovered
to be the only known element

855
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,745
able to stop the Armageddon device."

856
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,744
- We have to get out of here!
- What's wrong?

857
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:49,871
They're after the necklace!

858
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,786
858
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,263
That'll stop your clock.

860
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,512
860
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,937
Watch your head!

862
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,981
Oops! Sorry about that.

863
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,614
Well, the good news is, you're tall
enough to go on all the rides.

864
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:21,899
864
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:24,861

866
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,662
866
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,664

868
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:31,793
You children think you have
all the time in the world,

869
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,453
but soon I will.

870
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,212
Hand over the necklace.

871
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,462
found a more secret lair.

872
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,715
- What?

873
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,177
Leave my kids alone.

874
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,640
Stepkids.

875
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,352
Shh! She's here to save us.

876
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,892
How dare you waste time
bickering about that?

877
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,981
If you have no interest
in being a family,

878
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:01,239
then you don't deserve
any time together.

879
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,740
Well, he's right about one thing.

880
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:06,072
If we're gonna get outta here,
we need to work as a family.

881
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,033
Fire up your gadgets.

882
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,447
They're not activated.

883
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,615
- They're just souvenirs.
- Not any more.

884
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,160
884
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,545

886
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,589
Hammer time.

887
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,407
Cool.

888
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,038
888
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,453

890
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,213
A watch shop?

891
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,751
Slight left and proceed around building.

892
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,136
892
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,180
Turn right now.

894
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,599
Spy detected.

895
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,931
- It's a dumpster.

896
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:16,267
Walk forward now. Turn left now.

897
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,650
Left foot, right foot,
left foot, big right foot.

898
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,651
Center and stop.

899
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,312
Proceed below.

900
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:27,359
The annoying voice is saying
there's a spy right here. Look.

901
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,778
- Proceed below now.

902
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,121
This is more than a dumpster!

903
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:45,464
- Sorry!
- It's OK! Do it again!

904
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:09,067
Oh, shiitake mushrooms.

905
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,671
Come here. Come here, come here.

906
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,127
OK, ready?

907
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,634
Wilbur Wilson, Spy Hunter here.

908
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,261
As you can see, I'm in some
sort of underground secret lair

909
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,047
where the battle
for freedom and justice

910
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,341
is being fought
by our country's top spies.

911
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,180
I really can't see much from up here

912
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,937
but we can zoom in with our
Spy Hunt Cam and get a closer look.

913
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,019
Oh, the kids are gonna flip
when they see this.

914
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,315
Did you get that?
You got it? Go, go, go.

915
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,195
Argonaut, do something!

916
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,698
What do you want me to do?
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

917
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,234
917
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:52,989

919
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,698
- Attack mode activated.

920
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,454
It's show time!

921
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,591
921
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,802
Oh, someone put that on YouTube!

923
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:18,139
- Time flies when you're having fun.

924
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,518
My necklace!

925
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,446
Let's get the kids out of here!

926
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,402
Argonaut!

927
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,411
Release!

928
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,198
Oh, come on!
I was gonna bury him in the backyard!

929
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:43,461
Let them go. It's all part of the plan.

930
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,543
We have the Chronos Sapphire.

931
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,754
Nothing can stop us now.

932
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,384
Sorry about the necklace, Marissa.

933
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,268
"Sorry about the necklace, Marissa."

934
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,929
I should've given it
back to you when you asked.

935
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,097
Yes, you should've.

936
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,516
We had no idea
the Time Keeper wanted it.

937
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,105
"We're just dumb kids."

938
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,941
You couldn't have known.
It was classified.

939
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,573
The whole world's in big trouble.

940
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:13,778
Don't look at me.

941
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,033
It's all our fault.

942
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,116
And I'm sorry I didn't share
with you that I was a spy.

943
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:22,283
But it was important to me
that you were both protected and safe.

944
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,918
What's important is
stopping the Time Keeper.

945
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,454
Give us another chance.

946
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:31,251
You two have been so very brave
and I'm so proud of you.

947
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:34,421
That sounds like something
my mom would say.

948
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:37,673
948
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,098
- They want us back for a debrief.
- Take the kids back to OSS.

950
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,637
- I'll meet you there.
- Got it.

951
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,680
Thanks for rescuing us.

952
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,607
Any time.

953
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,150
I used to get in trouble
like this all the time.

954
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,157
Hi, sweetheart. Sorry I missed you.
Great news!

955
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:59,036
I got the most amazing footage of
a real spy battle at the watch shop!

956
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:02,494
I'm gonna put it
on the air tonight, primetime!

957
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,908
- The kids are gonna be so proud.
- Oh, no.

958
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,497
Love you, miss you, need you. Bye!
Call me back!

959
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,956
959
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:11,749
That's great!

961
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,839
We're gonna win an Emmy for this.
A Pulitzer.

962
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,801
Whoa, go back, go back.
Does she have a baby with her?

963
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,716
Oh, she does! Oh, that's priceless!

964
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:24,308
OK, we're gonna need a graphic
that reads "Spies Are Unfit Moms."

965
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,440
And, Wilbur, see if you can get a quote
from Child Protective Services.

966
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,522
If we're lucky, they'll take the
kids away, put 'em in foster care! Yeah!

967
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,436
- Whoo-hoo!

968
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:36,532
- Wilbur!
- Sorry. I'm a Klutz.

969
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,364
It's all right. I've got the original
tape right here.

970
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,288
Hm!

971
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,958
Tastes like chicken! Want some?

972
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,414
Out!

973
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,042
973
00:54:58,212 --> 00:54:59,714

975
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,177
Oh, really? Great.

976
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,384
Hi, honey.

977
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:08,898
Don't "honey" me.
There's no "honey"ing any more.

978
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:10,558
- You're a spy!

979
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:14,069
- You found out.
- Well, I'm a Spy Hunter.

980
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,697
And apparently I'm not a very good one,
since I've been living with one.

981
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,904
I retired the day we had the baby...

982
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:24,371
...because our family is the most
important thing in the world to me.

983
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,998
And...

984
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,033
...I'm so sorry.

985
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,249
Wow. I feel like such a fool.

986
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,581
Why did you marry me?

987
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,500
- You must've lost a bet, right?
- You're the man I love.

988
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:39,841
Well, uh, now I'm the man without a job

989
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,347
and maybe without a family.

990
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,720
Where are the kids?

991
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:48,307
They're under protective
surveillance at the OSS.

992
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:52,433
They're probably safer there anyway.

993
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,442
I mean, their own dad
can't protect them.

994
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,276
Just tell them I love them.

995
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,863
What about us?

996
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,869
I just...

997
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:05,700
...need time.

998
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,415
998
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:19,760

1000
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,387
We 're all running out of time.

1001
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,220
Some predicted it would
come in a blaze of fire,

1002
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,103
a giant flood, but it was the
ancient Mayans who got it right

1003
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:32,265
when they predicted en end
to the human calender,

1004
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,479
the end of time itself

1005
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,895
Can anyone save us from this
impending apocalypse,

1006
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,063
this final doomsday, this...

1007
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,825
Armageddon.

1008
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:47,614
Also known as the Wells Experiment.

1009
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,952
Back in the day, this contraption

1010
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,083
almost caused the end
of the world as we know it.

1011
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,791
That's why the OSS
shut the experiment down

1012
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:59,379
and placed the device in Level 13
lockdown, where it remains today.

1013
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,339
The fate of the world
is on the line here.

1014
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:06,348
That's why I'm calling upon one of our
most valued and skilled operatives,

1015
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,179
Agent Cortez.

1016
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:09,844
1016
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:13,355
He has even come out
of retirement to help us.

1018
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,605
1018
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:18,978

1020
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:22,990
Yeah!

1021
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,283
1021
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,749

1023
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:45,137
- It's good to be back.
- Then you never should have left.

1024
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,888
Where have you been
the last seven years?

1025
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,721
If I told you, then it wouldn't
be called a secret mission.

1026
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:53,353
It's not like I missed you or anything.
I needed a break from your face.

1027
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:56,140
Oh, what an incredible coincidence.

1028
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,559
- I needed a break from yours.
- Oh, whatever.

1029
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,394
What's going on over there?

1030
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,312
1030
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,691
Family reunion.

1032
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,943
- This isn't about us.
- Gosh.

1033
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:11,410
Carmen, this is about saving the world.

1034
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,495
- You don't deserve to wear this badge.
- Uh...

1035
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,170
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1036
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,458
All right, agents.
Let's make sure there is a tomorrow.

1037
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:26,591
- Let's go save the world!

1038
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:30,098
What do we get to do?
What's our assignment?

1039
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,559
1039
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,516
Man! Why are we in time-out?

1041
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:38,308
We found the Time Keeper.
So, why are we grounded?

1042
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,101
And why do we have to watch the baby?

1043
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:42,815
Technically, I'm watching her.

1044
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:46,949
Sometimes you're the dog, sometimes
you're the baby entertainment center.

1045
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,075
Danger D'Amo, director of the OSS.

1046
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,862
I wanted to commend you
on your brave service.

1047
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,997
You bobbleheads really
take after your mom.

1048
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:56,204
Stepmom.

1049
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,036
Let me give you some advice, kiddo.

1050
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,455
Don't get balled up
over that kind of baloney.

1051
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:05,717
She takes the time to love you...
you love her back.

1052
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,301
- Nice watch.
- Thanks.

1053
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,890
It was a gift from my pops.

1054
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:19,102
- You sure talk funny.

1055
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,609
- Danger D'Amo.
- Yeah.

1056
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:25,317
Did you know your name
is an anagram?

1057
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,151
1057
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:31,490
Switch the letters of your name around,
and it spells...

1059
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,073
...Armageddon

1060
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,204
As in the Armageddon device.

1061
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,033
Either that's a coincidence...

1062
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:45,173
...or that's just an
incredible coincidence.

1063
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,797
- You're ticking.

1064
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,307
It's an old watch.

1065
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:57,436
- But you're wearing three more.

1066
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,441
You're the Time Keeper.

1067
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,481
Yeah. I'd love to stick around
and chat but time is running out.

1068
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,490
1068
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:17,202
The head of the good guys is
actually the head of the bad guys?

1070
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,575
I did not see that coming.

1071
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,462
1071
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,873
Look around for a comlink or a phone!

1073
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,042
We have to warn Marissa!

1074
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,062
1074
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,977
Agent Wilson.

1076
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,357
- Turn around!
- It's a trap!

1077
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:47,645
- That's his secret identity!

1078
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,315
Look, I don't have time
for your pranks right now. OK?

1079
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,576
Watch Argonaut watch the baby.
Thank you.

1080
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,591
- The Armageddon device.

1081
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:14,054
It's tiny.

1082
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:19,517
1082
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:24,435
If time's the test, family is best.

1084
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:26,066
It's a trap.

1085
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:30,274
Hello, agents. You're right on time.

1086
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,367
The kids were right.

1087
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:39,450
1087
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,199
...who you thought I was.

1089
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,209
So where's the
real Armageddon device?

1090
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,292
Back at the OSS,
where it's always been.

1091
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:49,877
And now...

1092
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,046
...I must get back to it.

1093
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,962
- What's that?

1094
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,471
A really nice watch.

1095
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,429
It's also a freeze transmitter

1096
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:01,593
for all agents at the OSS.

1097
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,141
It's time to take out the competition.

1098
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,056
1098
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,200
Danger, don't.

1100
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:23,415
Now... to stop the world.

1101
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,183
Why didn't I freeze?

1102
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,349
I'm... trapped in here.

1103
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,181
I need reinforcements.

1104
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:51,192
But there are no reinforcements.
They're all frozen.

1105
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,362
Except...

1106
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:59,526
Time has run out for most of the planet.

1107
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,570
Eighteen time zones have been frozen

1108
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:04,205
by the Time Keeper's
Armageddon device.

1109
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:07,038
One thing's for certain...
it's heading our way.

1110
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,202
But we must not lose hope.

1111
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:12,877
Who are we kidding? It's over!
We 're toast!

1112
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,178
Attention, Spy Kids.
You have been activated.

1113
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:21,510
I repeat, you have been activated.

1114
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,259
Is he talking to us?

1115
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:27,350
At this very moment, the Time Keeper
is taking over OSS Headquarters.

1116
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,265
Your time has come to save the world.

1117
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,893
Every OSS agent has been frozen.

1118
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:36,359
It's up to you to shut down
the Armageddon device.

1119
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,866
Get the necklace back.
It's the only thing that can stop him.

1120
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:41,993
And how are we supposed to do that?

1121
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,154
Spy Kids have always been able
to beat the bad guys

1122
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,073
because adults over-think things.

1123
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,662
But to a kid, everything is possible.

1124
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,203
Trust me, I know.

1125
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:54,122
Just use your imagination
and work with each other,

1126
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,383
not against each other.

1127
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:59,420
So no more competing
against each other?

1128
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,297
Good.

1129
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:06,260
- Argonaut!
- Attack mode, por favor:

1130
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:07,643
1130
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,140
- Attack the door.
- Argo smash!

1132
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,106
What about the baby?

1133
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,440
Spy Kids.

1134
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,071
Spy Dog.

1135
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,230
Spy Baby.

1136
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,444
1136
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,280

1138
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,617
activated as Spy Kids,

1139
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,373
you are part of an elite team,

1140
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:32,126
and we need to work together,
like Juni said.

1141
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,958
No more competitions.

1142
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:37,382
We've got to break into the OSS vault,

1143
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,213
get to the Time Keeper,

1144
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:41,299
find the Chronos Sapphire,

1145
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,634
then use it to stop
the Armageddon device,

1146
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:46,300
and, of course, save the world.

1147
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,307
Cecil, you take the vault.
Rebecca, you're on pranks.

1148
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,599
And I, of course, will take
the toughest assignment of all...

1149
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:55,688
I'll watch the baby.

1150
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:01,023
So I realized the only way
he could freeze agents

1151
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,987
was through their OSS badges.

1152
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,321
There you go.

1153
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,578
Thanks for trashing mine, Carmen.

1154
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:10,157
Thanks, Juni. Unfreeze your sister.

1155
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,496
OK, but first...

1156
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:14,502
...this is how I remember you.

1157
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:17,164
And there we go.

1158
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,297
- Juni!
- Hm?

1159
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,799
Unfreeze her.

1160
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,552
But it's so peaceful and quiet.

1161
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:24,759
There.

1162
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,970
This never would've happened
if I was mission leader.

1163
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,852
- I activated Rebecca and Cecil.
- What?

1164
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,557
They're more ready than you think.

1165
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,770
If anything happens to those kids,
you're toast.

1166
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,025
This way.

1167
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:44,073
1167
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:50,993
- Real smooth, diaper lady.

1169
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,829
I was just following my instincts.

1170
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,210
Well, your in-stinks!

1171
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,167
You two were the best spy team ever.

1172
01:05:58,329 --> 01:05:59,546
What happened?

1173
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,504
Yeah.
Where have you been all these years?

1174
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,512
I tried to strike out on my own,
and I struck out. OK?

1175
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:09,050
OK, but Mom and Dad left
the family business to the both of us.

1176
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:10,717
Yeah. Well...

1177
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:15,060
I guess I thought it wasn't cool
to keep working with my sister.

1178
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,391
It's what would've made you cool.

1179
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,651
Where's Marissa?

1180
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,656
- It's quicksand!

1181
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,165
Don't make me punch your lights out.

1182
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:48,638
1182
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,681

1184
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,392
Now you've seen my dark side.

1185
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:01,651
- Low battery?

1186
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,320
1186
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:12,654
"Don't rely on your gadgets."

1188
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,829
1188
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,458
Hmm...

1190
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,005
1190
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:30,005
Hello?

1192
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,718
Is anyone in here?

1193
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,642
You get the door open yet?

1194
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:41,684
- I think we need another way in.

1195
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,647
OK. I'll be there in a minute.

1196
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:50,992
1196
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,278
You caught a kid.

1198
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,821
1198
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,835

1200
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,846
Enjoy the ride!

1201
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,348
Now what?

1202
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,513
- We give up.

1203
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,808
it's the only way
we'll get the necklace back.

1204
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:24,897
Just follow my lead.

1205
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,612
Hand over your weapons.

1206
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,451
All of your weapons.

1207
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:55,181
OSS agents have been frozen in time.

1208
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:58,469
Is there someone, anyone,
out there that can save the day?

1209
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:00,057
Hello, Wilbur

1210
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:03,814
Yes, this is your dog, and I'm talking,
but never mind about that now.

1211
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,067
Rebecca and Cecil are in danger.

1212
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:08,899
They've been captured by the
Time Keeper and they need your help.

1213
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:13,363
I know it's hard to believe, sin
but you're their last hope.

1214
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,364
I 'd hurry if I were you.

1215
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:52,609
1215
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,658

1217
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,460
1217
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:26,473
What's with the jazz hands?
Huh, kiddies?

1219
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:31,145
My brother's hearing impaired.
And your goon took his hearing aids.

1220
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,984
Give him his hearing aids back.
We're not monsters here.

1221
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:38,656
No. You're only trying to end the world.

1222
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,115
Why are you doing this?

1223
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:45,330
The Armageddon device was not
meant to end the world or stop time.

1224
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:48,540
It was meant to travel back in time.

1225
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:51,923
To get me back to that.

1226
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:56,670
- My father.
- Son, come here! Take a look at this.

1227
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:59,840
was an early attempt to time travel.

1228
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:02,513
That's me before the accident.

1229
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:06,270
My father was working
on the original prototype.

1230
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:10,350
They were just about to test
the machine when it went haywire.

1231
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:15,359
He told me not to play near the lab.

1232
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,785
But I never listened.

1233
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:25,953
It trapped me in time for
so many years I almost lost count.

1234
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,785
You were the Boy Frozen In Time.

1235
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,959
My father spent his entire life...

1236
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:33,964
...trying to set me free.

1237
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,973
1237
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:46,219

1239
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,188
...and, eventually...

1240
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,433
...die.

1241
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,694
The OSS shut down the experiment

1242
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:59,232
with a solution
that literally fell from the sky...

1243
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:00,991
...the Chronos Sapphire.

1244
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,908
When the effects wore off
I was a grown man in a boy's body.

1245
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,751
All my friends were gone.

1246
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:12,962
My father...

1247
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:14,751
gone.

1248
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:19,340
Everything and everyone
I cared about was no more.

1249
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:22,597
And all of this is
so you can see your father again?

1250
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:25,884
I want more time!

1251
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,261
With him.

1252
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:32,272
He gave me everything.

1253
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,354
And I couldn't even
give him the time of day,

1254
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,611
because I didn't know...

1255
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,569
...that our time
would be so short together.

1256
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:44,118
But now when I go back,
things are gonna be different.

1257
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:46,700
- No, they won't.
- Excuse me?

1258
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,957
travel through time.

1259
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,492
Time stays the same.

1260
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,411
You're just creating
multiple versions of yourself

1261
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:56,081
that appear at
different points in time.

1262
01:12:56,789 --> 01:13:00,293
He's wrong. Our plan will work.

1263
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,757
You've tried this before and failed.

1264
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,139
And my guess is that you've...

1265
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:09,261
...already gone back in time a lot.

1266
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:13,811
This isn't the first time
you've traveled back.

1267
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:17,853
And every time you return,
you come back worse.

1268
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,904
Each time, your plan fails.

1269
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,943
You try it again with another you.

1270
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,828
But when are you going to learn...

1271
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:29,660
...you can't change the past?

1272
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,916
You will only cause Armageddon.

1273
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:36,079
Don't listen to him.
This time, it will work!

1274
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,465
You will go back and you will
have all the time in the world

1275
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:41,467
to spend with your father.

1276
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:43,845
Danger, when my mom died,

1277
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,347
it was the worst thing
that could ever happen to me.

1278
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,507
I wished I had more time with her.

1279
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:50,843
There is no going back.

1280
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,896
Honor the years you had with him.

1281
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,103
Those brief..

1282
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,109
...Special moments...

1283
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,312
...are the ones we'll remember.

1284
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:06,701
It's not about how much time you have.

1285
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:10,204
- It's what you choose to do with it.

1286
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:13,537
T minus 20 minutes until Armageddon.

1287
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,248
The Time Vortex is opening!

1288
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,211
How'd you get outta my sand trap?

1289
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:27,051
With my bare hands.

1290
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,557
Actually, it was my Atomic Lipstick.

1291
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,265
Keep away from my stepkids.

1292
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,722
Make that your kids.

1293
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:37,848
All right.

1294
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:40,568
Make that your Spy Kids.

1295
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:45,648
Stay away from my Spy Kids.

1296
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,317
Too late!

1297
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,652
1297
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:02,882
It worked! It worked!

1299
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,260
Everyone in the world
is frozen except us.

1300
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,887
1300
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,766
The Chronos!

1302
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:18,390
of the watch or you'll freeze!

1303
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:19,978
We have to use the necklace

1304
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,611
to stop the Armageddon device
once and for all!

1305
01:15:24,979 --> 01:15:26,652
Get into the Vortex.

1306
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:48,173
Wait, you don't
have your Hammer Hands.

1307
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:50,796
I don't need Hammer Hands.

1308
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:58,516
1308
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,605
- Yeah!
- Cecil!

1310
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:06,941
1310
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:19,583

1312
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,835
Hey, Marissa gave that to me!

1313
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:35,762
- Don't do it, Danger!
- You can't bring back the past!

1314
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,848
Time is the enemy of youth.

1315
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,683
I'm getting mine back.

1316
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:41,768
You won't change anything!

1317
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,763
I thought you said
nothing would change.

1318
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:16,265
Wait for it.

1319
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,644
Who's that?

1320
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:29,937
That's Danger.

1321
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:39,826
You were right.

1322
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:43,667
You can't go back.

1323
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:46,663
I tried.

1324
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,756
My father still died...

1325
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:52,960
...no matter what
I tried to do to save him.

1326
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:58,890
He did tell me one thing

1327
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,972
that was very important.

1328
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:06,228
You have to live life

1329
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:09,519
moving forwards, not back.

1330
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,321
This time...

1331
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,152
...I'm gonna listen to him.

1332
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,502
1332
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:34,965

1334
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,349
Kids!

1335
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,722
Marissa!

1336
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:45,980
I was so worried about you guys.
Are you OK?

1337
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:49,108
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry I brought you into this.

1338
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:53,442
Worst stepmom ever.

1339
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:55,485
Yeah.

1340
01:18:55,648 --> 01:19:00,028
But best spy mom ever!
I like when you're being yourself.

1341
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:05,500
- Come here.

1342
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:08,252
- You think you've stopped me?

1343
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,504
You've stopped nothing.

1344
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:14,509
We're just gonna keep doing this
over and over and over again

1345
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:17,011
until I get what I want!

1346
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:20,844
Because this time, time is on my side!

1347
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,521
Yeah. Hard time.

1348
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:35,067
- Clocked ya.

1349
01:19:36,063 --> 01:19:37,690
Lucky punch!

1350
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:41,823
How'd you find us?

1351
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:44,489
I'm Wilbur Wilson, your father.

1352
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,453
You're the coolest dad ever.

1353
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:54,290
I'm not gonna wait until I have enough
time for us to spend together.

1354
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,049
From now on...

1355
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,336
...we're gonna make time.

1356
01:19:59,003 --> 01:20:00,926
Now that's heroic.

1357
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,100
So...

1358
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:11,140
So...

1359
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,648
You're a spy?

1360
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:18,565
Yeah. I'm a spy.

1361
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:21,071
Well...

1362
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:23,744
...I'm a Spy Hunter.

1363
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,413
Got you.

1364
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,996
And I'm never letting go.

1365
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:40,378
Now this is family time.

1366
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:45,182
Juni and I have decided
to become co-leaders

1367
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:47,594
of the new Spy Kids program.

1368
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,603
We're gonna need some new recruits

1369
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:53,608
with ingenuity, creativity,
and heads-up thinking.

1370
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:56,360
Rebecca, Cecil?

1371
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,316
And of course...

1372
01:20:58,479 --> 01:20:59,776
...Spy Baby.

1373
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:04,489
Yeah. Baby's got a surprise for you.

1374
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,622
Don't get... This is it, group,
that's it. Just...

1375
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,874
Baby's first steps!

1376
01:21:11,033 --> 01:21:14,913
You're more impressed by a kid
standing up than a dog that can talk?

1377
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:16,626
Hold on a second, I...

1378
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:21,381
1378
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:22,924
Nice!

1380
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:26,887
Oh! Baby's first bad guy!

1381
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,892
- Wow!
- I taught her that.

1382
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:30,894
Well...

1383
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:33,476
...you can never start 'em too young.

1384
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:35,687
Mommy's so proud of you!

1385
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:47,369
We are back on the clock,
back to taking our own sweet time

1386
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:50,748
to laugh, to cry,
to embrace our loved ones.

1387
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,659
We have all the time in the world.

1388
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:56,746
Or do we?

1389
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:01,338
Operation Spy Kid Recruitment.

1390
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,672
1390
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:08,598

1392
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,805
Setting filters to max.

1393
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:21,820
You have been activated.

1394
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,867
And you have been activated.

1395
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:30,450
I now declare you all Spy Kids.

1396
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:34,491
That's one point for me.

1397
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:36,289
Ouch.

1398
