1
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,416
Yo, dawg.

2
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,149
Konnichiwa.

3
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,509
What?

4
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:17,591
Konnichiwa.
Konnichiwa means, "What's up?"

5
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,820
-So what the fuck's up?
-We know what it means.

6
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,120
Hey, you want a smoke?

7
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,364
You can read the paper through this,
it's so clean.

8
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:28,162
A couple of hits,
you'll be fucking like beasts.

9
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,800
-You boys like pussy, right?
-Hey!

10
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,405
Do we look like fucking tweakers to you?

11
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,676
-So you got the shit or not?
-Yeah. You?

12
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,547
What the fuck is this?
We said a machine gun.

13
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,091
It is a machine gun.

14
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:53,985
The kind you can carry.

15
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,957
Couldn't get none of those.

16
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,654
This baby's got character.
Korean War vintage.

17
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,825
Maybe even mowed down
one of your grandpapa-sans

18
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,765
when he was charging the wire at Inch'on.

19
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,134
This is bullshit. It's fucking stuck.

20
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,604
Fuck it, take the ride.
Three large. VIN's clean.

21
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,699
Nigga, I drive a $100,000 car!

22
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,335
We want your faggoty-ass ride,
we'll jack it from you.

23
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,671
Cool. Don't decide right now.

24
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:18,240
Konnichiwa is Japanese.
It's insulting to Koreans.

25
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,075
How am I supposed to tell if you can't?

26
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,621
What the fuck is that supposed to mean,
white boy?

27
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:26,784
It means you got eyes like apostrophes,
you dress white, talk black and drive Jew.

28
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,862
So, how am I supposed to know what kind
of zipperhead,

29
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,624
dog-munching dink you are if you don't?

30
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:32,858
Yo.

31
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,166
Do you know who the fuck we are?

32
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,395
Yeah.

33
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,998
You're a couple of panheads
buying a machine gun out of a trunk.

34
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,968
Wassup, you son of a bitch?

35
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,380
-Pick him up.
-Get your ass up.

36
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,347
I'm getting the shit out of here.

37
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:56,582
Give me the keys!

38
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,528
-Konnichiwa, bitch.
-Let's go!

39
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,796
Where?

40
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,285
It's okay.

41
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,354
I'm a cop.

42
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,519
Captain Wander, congratulations
on breaking the case.

43
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,954
Can you tell me how you found the twins?

44
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,083
Julie, my people had turned the city
upside down looking for these girls.

45
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,253
I could not be prouder of my men.

46
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,357
Ma'am, excuse me.

47
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,296
How can you shoot a guy taking a dump?

48
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,833
I mean, seriously. That... That's sacred.
That's like shooting a man in church.

49
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:38,996
Or a Dodger game.

50
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,973
Hey, whatever it takes to be a hero.
Anytime, anyplace, right, Lud?

51
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,042
It gets old.

52
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:43,343
I hate these short-eyed,
kiddie-raping bastards.

53
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,436
I hate these short-eyed,
kiddie-raping bastards.

54
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,513
At least kidnap some full-grown ladies
with shapes.

55
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,447
Wow. Maybe you should check his closet
next, huh, Lud?

56
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,110
The girls are being examined
by a physician right now.

57
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,848
Both twins are in good health

58
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,186
and will be reunited
with their family shortly.

59
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,851
LA Times front page tomorrow
is gonna say,

60
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:04,328
"Vice Detective Rescues Missing Twins."

61
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,292
Detective. Singular.

62
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,563
Yeah. Like we've been sitting around
on our ass

63
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,001
doing jack-shit in our unit the last month.

64
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,005
Hey! You two cut the shit.
The boss is on his way right now.

65
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,540
I mean, you could have saved some for us.

66
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,337
-I did you a solid, Santos.
-You did me a solid?

67
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,639
You want to see their faces every night?
You want to be a killer?

68
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,179
You know what? Shut the fuck up.

69
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,646
Hey, hey, what the hell is going on?

70
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,377
Hey! This is real professional.

71
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:29,683
What if I walked in here
with the Chief, huh?

72
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,588
Santos, deploy your ass outside.

73
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,787
Find Ted Berman and make sure that
that crime scene log is in order.

74
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,659
-Yes, sir.
-Run along, boy.

75
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:38,788
Shut the fuck up.

76
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,924
Hey, secure that bullshit,
all right? Both of you.

77
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,265
Clady, you take DeMille back to the barn
and start writing.

78
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,305
I want something to red-pin by midnight.

79
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:48,203
Tell those body monkeys
to get right in here.

80
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,640
You got it, Cap. Let's go.

81
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,181
This is crazy!

82
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,616
You fucked them up!

83
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,860
This is beautiful.

84
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,554
And that machine gun shit,
that was perfect.

85
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,759
I know you hated waiting,
but it's better this way.

86
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,927
-You all right?
-Yeah. I...

87
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,967
-I got shot.
-Yeah, but you okay?

88
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,837
Yeah, I'm okay, Jack.

89
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:24,944
'Cause I know you're not tripping
about these...

90
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,070
These assholes right here?

91
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,572
Fuck them. Screw them.

92
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:32,277
You went toe-to-toe with evil
and you won.

93
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,180
You saved those girls.

94
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,983
This is lovely, Tommy.

95
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,082
Come here. Come here, man.
Give me... Give me a hug!

96
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,490
Come on.

97
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,896
-Ribs are tender.
-What you hiding from?

98
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,466
-Nothing.
-What you hiding from?

99
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,193
You've been drinking.

100
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,037
You know that...
That thing they say about vodka?

101
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,042
How you can't smell it?

102
00:12:57,144 --> 00:13:01,513
It's bullshit. The D.A.'s shooting team
is en route right now.

103
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,015
And you're not ready
for public consumption.

104
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,608
So, come on.
I want to get you to a hospital,

105
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,585
get you away from all those guys.
Come on.

106
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,553
All right. Thanks, Jack.

107
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,593
I think we can do some damage control.

108
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,098
If it ain't LA's deadliest white boy.

109
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,903
Aren't you on the wrong side
of the yellow tape?

110
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:33,569
Congrats on four more notches
for your gun belt.

111
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,978
I'll be praying for the families
of your victims.

112
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,550
They're called suspects.

113
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:42,213
The victims are the 14-year-old school
girls the suspects kept in a cage

114
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,689
and sold to chicken hawks
to poke, prod and put on the Internet.

115
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,282
Suspects, Washington.

116
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,826
Suspects.

117
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,358
As evil as those men were,
they had a right to trial.

118
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,995
There's gonna be some blowback
from the Korean community on this one.

119
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,697
Now that you're all militant,
why don't you just say it?

120
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,068
You think I'm a racist.

121
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,438
-You have another explanation?
-No, I don't.

122
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:07,274
Because if I roll and determine the
suspects are black, yellow or brown,

123
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,314
I'll blow them out of their socks.

124
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,385
But if they're white,
I'll give them a ride home.

125
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,484
You know why? 'Cause I'm a racist.
Fuck you.

126
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,581
Man, I would give my right arm to have
that shit on tape.

127
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,351
What happened to you, Terrence?

128
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,122
We used to be brothers.

129
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,030
Hey, hey, stay on point.
Washington, you stay on point.

130
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,799
Always, Captain Wander. Always.

131
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,907
Tom. Come on, let's get you out of here.

132
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,647
-Don't go near that piece of shit.
-He's got it coming, Jack.

133
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,875
Do not go near him.
You stay away, far away.

134
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,918
-Fuck him.
-That's an order.

135
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:50,854
I'm waiting for Nurse Garcia.

136
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,057
I did the same thing with this girl once.

137
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,532
She was a waitress at a jazz bar.

138
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:05,969
And I'd sit in her section,
wouldn't let anybody else serve me.

139
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,540
She'd change sections, I'd change tables.

140
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,378
Persistence. That's the key.

141
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,646
Wait a second.

142
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:22,452
You're that cop! You're...
I just seen your face on TV.

143
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,922
You rescued those twins
in Koreatown, right?

144
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,754
Are you okay? Did you get shot?

145
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:31,888
No.

146
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,696
Yeah.

147
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,292
Who the hell are you?

148
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:40,203
Me? I sell insurance, life, auto, casualty.

149
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,469
Wow, that's some heavy shit, man.

150
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:47,012
So those guys, they...
They shot first, right?

151
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,606
Excuse me?

152
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,108
Whole city was looking for those kids.

153
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,579
How'd you find them?

154
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,720
That's my job.

155
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,487
Sergeant Green,
Sergeant Green...

156
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,653
Excuse me, Captain.

157
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,162
Sorry to interrupt.

158
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,393
Deputy Chief Sorensen
is trying to raise you on a simplex.

159
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,659
Insurance, Tom.

160
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,397
I sell insurance.

161
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:18,335
If you ever need any, and you will,

162
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:19,810
why don't you give me a call?

163
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:21,471
No one has to know but us.

164
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,879
Not Clady, not Wander, no one.

165
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,983
Listen, for your own good,

166
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,915
don't get yourself so far out there
that I can't reel you back.

167
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,396
See you sometime.

168
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,094
Who was that?

169
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:48,641
A cop who burns cops. Jesus.

170
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:50,937
-Who?
-Nobody, Grace.

171
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,239
-Hi.
-Hi.

172
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,248
Oh.

173
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,854
Hold this.

174
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,382
You know, you can just stop by sometime.

175
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,356
You don't have to get shot
when you want to see me.

176
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:11,897
Why? I like it like this.
Don't you?

177
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,662
No, I don't.

178
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,165
I don't.

179
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,527
No. Don't get close to me.

180
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,801
I work here.
I'm not losing my license for you.

181
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,535
-I'm a cop.
-No.

182
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:27,646
Whatever.

183
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,982
I kicked the door after identifying
myself as a police officer.

184
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:37,546
Upon entry, I was fired upon by a suspect
in the living room with a silver automatic.

185
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,091
I returned fire, he goes down.

186
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,963
Then I'm hit in the torso by shotgun fire
from the second suspect.

187
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,053
Point of entry?

188
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,962
Front door on the west side
of the structure.

189
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,035
Why didn't you call for backup?

190
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,763
Exigent circumstances.

191
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:56,739
I heard screams emanating from the house
and ascertained a crime was in progress.

192
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,904
...saying something.
-Take care, Silk.

193
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,599
-It was great working with you.
-Thanks a lot.

194
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,342
Now it's a party.

195
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,638
Oh, my goodness!
Now it's a binge, Captain.

196
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,270
-What's up, killer?
-Steady.

197
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,211
Steady. Yeah, he's in.

198
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,252
What's with you?
What, Clady give you a happy ending?

199
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,844
Is that any way to address a commander?

200
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,948
I got the call from the Chief this morning.
Badge ceremony's next week.

201
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,993
Congratulations, boss.

202
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,562
Hey. We're gonna have
the keys to the city.

203
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,458
You believe that shit?
They're crowning him king.

204
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,693
Let's get a toast to that.
A toast to the king!

205
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,702
-King Wander!
-King Wander!

206
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,533
Yo, boss.
Can I be your driver when you make chief?

207
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,869
You got it. You got it.
Whatever you want.

208
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,068
You know, I owe you one, Tom.

209
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,873
That Park twins caper,
that gave me the edge.

210
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,541
You know, the Chief, he's breaking
tradition by promoting me here.

211
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,051
The first commander slot always goes
to the head of Internal Affairs.

212
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,121
That's the way it is.

213
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,415
That's because they got so much dirt
on everyone.

214
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,549
That's right, and they're always looking
for more, huh?

215
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:20,826
Yeah.

216
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,520
You know this prick?

217
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:28,089
Came at me like Joe Concerned Citizen,
asking procedural questions.

218
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,761
Yeah, yeah, we got a history, this little...

219
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,605
See, if you showed up during the daytime,

220
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,105
you would know who your enemies are.

221
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,675
What'd you tell him?

222
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,605
I couldn't help myself, Clady.
I told him everything.

223
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,678
DeMILLE: Attaboy!

224
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,872
You know, this is a typical Biggs
bullshit move.

225
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,211
This is his M.O.
He'll back-door you every fucking time.

226
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,308
Why is Internal Affairs up my ass
all of a sudden?

227
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,185
It's Washington, brother.
Your ex-partner's been snitching.

228
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,022
Holy shit.

229
00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,958
Jack, talk to me.

230
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:05,134
Washington's had several meetings with
Captain Biggs over the last few weeks.

231
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,569
There are no secrets in the department.

232
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:09,471
So, when I became cognizant
of the problem,

233
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:10,565
we threw a tail on him.

234
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,111
I followed this guy Eastside,
Westside, Southside.

235
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,545
Next thing I know,
he's ringing Biggs' doorbell in Upland.

236
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,548
Who's Washington giving up?

237
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,418
You, Tom.

238
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,881
-Me. Why now?
-Yeah.

239
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:30,019
Because I shitcanned him from the unit
and he's a vindictive bastard.

240
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:33,223
Now he's on a mission to pull the rug out
from under all my best guys.

241
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,097
All my best guys.
That's what this shit is about.

242
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

243
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,704
-Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!
-Man!

244
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,365
Tommy, hey, that's your life.

245
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,076
-That's your life right there.
-I'm just gonna talk...

246
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,100
-That's your life right there.
-I'm just gonna talk...

247
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,973
-No, you're not. You're not.
-You want to talk?

248
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,206
Let's talk about my foot up your ass if you
don't sit the fuck down

249
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:49,906
-in that goddamn chair.
-He's all right. Have a seat.

250
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,847
Come on. He's all right.

251
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,518
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

252
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:01,785
Do not, and I repeat,
do not hand Washington your badge.

253
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:05,186
I know you two
have done some dirt together.

254
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,331
But we gotta hold the line, you and me.

255
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,170
We've been here before, haven't we?

256
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,705
When the gates of hell opened up
on you, Tom?

257
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:17,003
And I took care of you then.
I'm gonna take care of you now.

258
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,475
All right?

259
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,205
Okay. Okay.

260
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,381
Washington. Washington.

261
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,808
-Drop it, Tom! Now!
-What the hell are you doing?

262
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,284
-You going to kill me, partner?
-You're crazy! We got a 211 in progress!

263
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,018
I got you, I got you and Wander.

264
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,286
Listen to me, you idiot!

265
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,658
We got two gangbangers rolling in hot!

266
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:26,739
Shit!

267
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,735
Washington, stay with me, partner.

268
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:24,920
-Don't move! Let me see your hands!
-I'm a cop.

269
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,999
I'm a cop! I'm a fucking cop!

270
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:30,127
Fuck. It's Ludlow.

271
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:31,567
Get me an ambulance. Now.

272
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,138
Holy shit.

273
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,936
He's a cop, too?

274
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,301
Yeah.

275
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,219
Where's the video?

276
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,980
-Who else has seen this shit?
-Just us, boss.

277
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,912
It was a straight 211 that went sideways.

278
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,678
It's not what it was, Lud.
It's what it looks like.

279
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,685
But it's not what it looks like.

280
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,914
-It's not.
-That's all there is, Tom!

281
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:01,149
What it looks like! What everybody sees!
You knew that!

282
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,989
Lud, anybody in the department
sees this video,

283
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,323
you're no longer a cop,
do you understand that?

284
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,228
The department? The D.A. sees this...

285
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,663
He's... He's going to prison.

286
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,135
Why? Because Washington was in
the wrong place at the wrong time?

287
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,001
No, because you were.

288
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:17,337
Washington's problems are over,
yours are just beginning.

289
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,878
Try to think two moves ahead for once.

290
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:25,077
Captain Biggs will say that you got
two thugs off the street

291
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:28,585
and went after a cop who was diming you
out to Internal Affairs.

292
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:29,677
It writes itself.

293
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:32,189
-I was just gonna break his jaw.
-That's a good answer.

294
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:35,556
I gave you a direct order,
stay away from him.

295
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,598
Give me your goddamn burner now.

296
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,397
Give me your goddamn burner!

297
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:50,433
We know you don't give a shit about
yourself, Lud. That's pretty obvious.

298
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:51,601
But you gotta think about the unit.

299
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:54,145
-You really fucked us on this one.
-Clady.

300
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,646
-Give me a minute, please.
-Yes, sir.

301
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,752
I can't afford to lose you.

302
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,150
Who'd do what you do?

303
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:12,258
You are the tip of the fucking spear.

304
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:17,029
Who's gonna hold back the animals?

305
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,773
Maybe

306
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:27,943
the clerk

307
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:33,006
forgot to put the disc
in the recorder today.

308
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:42,517
Maybe you were first on the scene, Tom,
and you rendered aid to Washington.

309
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:49,100
I'll go outside.

310
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,698
Make some calls.

311
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:58,437
And maybe,

312
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:01,710
this won't be here

313
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,149
when I get back.

314
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,367
He was my partner back in the day.

315
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:04,465
We were black and white in a black
and white when it was still a big deal.

316
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:09,403
White cops wouldn't back us 'cause of him
and the black cops 'cause of me.

317
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,116
Fuck them.

318
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,017
We made it.

319
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,117
Sorry. You tried to save him.
You did your best.

320
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:21,656
My best?
I was curled up in a ball while he got shot.

321
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:23,795
We should have dumped those guys.

322
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:28,424
How can they just wave a pen
and change what happens just like that?

323
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:31,526
We're the police.
We can do whatever the hell we want.

324
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:35,364
Doesn't matter what happens.
It's how we write it up.

325
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:36,964
What about the truth?

326
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,274
What about it?

327
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,147
You have to honor him, your friend.

328
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,877
"Honor him"?

329
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:48,954
I was going to knock him out
and he thought I was going to kill him.

330
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,077
Prick.

331
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,986
Don't turn your back on him.

332
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,488
Good can come from bad.

333
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,593
In my world, the real world,

334
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,793
the bad breeds more bad, Grace.

335
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:16,579
See this? It's done. It's over.
It's taken care of. All right?

336
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:24,086
I won't give you another dose here,

337
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,750
but got a set of blues in your locker?

338
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:28,855
-No.
-Here's the thing.

339
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,428
-I gotta bury you.
-Not that.

340
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:35,523
In a nice, politically correct spot until this
Washington thing settles down a little bit.

341
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:36,692
No, Jack.

342
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:37,002
Your job is to conduct
preliminary interviews of the complainant.

343
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,563
Your job is to conduct
preliminary interviews of the complainant.

344
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:46,543
If there's a specific allegation
against an officer,

345
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:49,170
write it up, forward it to Internal Affairs.

346
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:53,377
Now, the temptation is to be
a good brother cop.

347
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,685
Don't be. None of this shit's
going anywhere anyway.

348
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:00,091
There's your desk.

349
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,696
Suppose I get a complaint against myself?

350
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:09,730
Write it up and forward it. Okay?

351
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,094
-Okay.
-Okay.

352
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,911
You have a complaint?

353
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:27,452
Motherfucker beat my ass like I was
Rodney King, man.

354
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,316
Except there wasn't no video.

355
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,116
Dude looked just like you.

356
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:32,646
But black.

357
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:37,593
This ass been working longer than all
y'all cops disrespecting me.

358
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:40,893
He pulled me out of my ride, homes,
disrespected me in front of my old lady.

359
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,298
Tried to get her number and shit.

360
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,370
You get his badge number
or see his nametag?

361
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:48,201
Not with his boot on my throat
and his partner kicking me.

362
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:49,296
No, it was a little bit difficult.

363
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,171
Everybody comes here,
they have a complaint.

364
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:53,211
They sit down.
I done waited for my fucking five hours

365
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:54,904
and you gonna ask me,
do I have a complaint?

366
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,914
Obviously, I have a complaint.

367
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,773
You know what? This is some bullshit.

368
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,317
That's why I hate
all these motherfucking cops.

369
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,886
Fuck all y'all!

370
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,532
Wander has got a sense of humor,
I'll give him that.

371
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,123
You have a complaint?

372
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:18,235
Where to begin?

373
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:22,272
The black band.

374
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:25,239
Man down. Hurts, right?

375
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,045
Losing a colleague. Brother in blue.

376
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,275
I'm sorry he's gone, sir.

377
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,912
You two worked Vice Special together.
Pushed a black and white in Southend.

378
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,750
Phonebook Tom,

379
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,517
the last of the ghetto gunfighters.

380
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:44,291
I heard you got your best confession
with a '91 directory.

381
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,160
You know Washington was holding
the asshole down.

382
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,958
Is this an interview?

383
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,502
Just a little back and forth.

384
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:56,404
Well, Captain, I'm not much of a dancer,
so if there's something you'd like to ask...

385
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,810
Want to go and get some lunch, Tom?

386
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,506
This is the interview.

387
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:06,642
Regarding yesterday's incident,
you were the first on scene, correct?

388
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:10,078
Yes, sir.

389
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:13,283
-Three shooters, right?
-Two. Read the report.

390
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:15,986
What would you say if I told you
the pathologist recovered

391
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:19,030
three different calibers
from Terrence Washington's body?

392
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:22,091
Sounds like three shooters to me.

393
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:25,036
What were you doing there, Tom?

394
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,110
Come on, man to man. Tape's off.

395
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:36,647
Damn it!

396
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:39,547
It doesn't bother you that
there are two cop killers out there?

397
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,983
Living, laughing, fucking?
It doesn't bother you, Tom?

398
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,520
Yes, it bothers me!

399
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,850
So, why'd you let them
get away, gunfighter?

400
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:50,360
Hey, let's get something straight, Captain,
nobody's getting away.

401
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,828
What happened to the video
from the store?

402
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,331
What video?

403
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:59,229
Listen to me. Every time you shit the bed,

404
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:02,671
Wander's there to change the sheets.
Well, not anymore, son.

405
00:34:02,775 --> 00:34:04,709
I'm going to pour gas on you,

406
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,973
I'm going to pour gas on Wander
and everyone in Vice Special.

407
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,277
Then I'm lighting the match
and I'm gonna burn all of you.

408
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:14,576
I tried to save you, Detective Ludlow.

409
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:17,018
Your window's closed.

410
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:21,491
And that third shooter?
He's mine, so help me God.

411
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,628
Get back in your office!

412
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,964
-Captain, you there?
-I'll call you back.

413
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,765
What the fuck are you doing in my office?

414
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,503
What the fuck are you doing
jamming my people at lunch?

415
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,375
If you got a problem with Ludlow,
you come to me.

416
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:44,608
You keep your dog on a leash.

417
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:47,283
Everybody knows
he can't make a move without you.

418
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:48,444
You go cry to Daddy?

419
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:49,919
Stop right there.

420
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:51,919
Stop.

421
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:56,257
Tom is a damn fine cop.

422
00:34:56,829 --> 00:34:58,729
He bleeds blue.

423
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,367
You got an open case on him?

424
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,232
Vice Special?

425
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,594
You got one on me?

426
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,899
You formally investigating us?

427
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,810
This is a fishing expedition.

428
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,912
Because you know if you went to the Chief
and you asked him

429
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,280
to open a case on me
or anybody in my unit,

430
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:21,875
he would laugh you out of his office.

431
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:24,182
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

432
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,383
I have watched you intimidate,
bully and blackmail

433
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:29,688
your way up through the pay grades
for 20 plus years.

434
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,854
I know exactly what you are.

435
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:35,762
You've got no business being
a commander.

436
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:39,629
You like Tom, don't you?

437
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,767
I saw the way you watched him
when he came in.

438
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:48,335
That's why you follow him around,
you want him to give you a blow job.

439
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:52,146
Like that hooker I caught you with
when we were sergeants.

440
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,741
-You remember?
-Shut up, Jack.

441
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:58,289
Does your wife know that
you use prostitutes, Jimmy?

442
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,089
It was the best head I ever had.

443
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,457
And what about you, Jack?

444
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:07,862
You always found it hard to keep
your prick out of the ghetto.

445
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:11,993
It's a two-way street, buddy.
You can't ride the tiger forever.

446
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,529
Now get the hell out of my office.

447
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,540
Do the department a favor,

448
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:19,800
and wash your mouth out with buckshot.

449
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,710
Come on, Tom. Let's get out of here.

450
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:36,221
From his time on the street
to his time in your schools and homes,

451
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:39,764
Detective Washington was tireless

452
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:44,191
in his devotion to his church,
his love for his family,

453
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:47,094
and his dedication to this department.

454
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,899
Uniform Detail. Atten-hut!

455
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:54,445
Honor Guard, port arms!

456
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:58,475
Half right face!

457
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:03,052
Ready, aim, fire!

458
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:04,980
Aim, fire!

459
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:07,616
Aim, fire!

460
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:11,656
Uniform Detail, present arms!

461
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,585
He was a good guy. We'll miss him.

462
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,856
We'll go back to work now. Back to work.

463
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:43,860
-Listen, that was a nice speech. Thank you.
-Let's go get them.

464
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:45,355
Thank you, sir.

465
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,071
Mrs. Washington.

466
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,208
I was first on scene.

467
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,047
Yeah, of course you were.

468
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:10,515
Excuse me.

469
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,437
You Diskant?

470
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,334
Yeah.

471
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,272
You're working Washington?

472
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:36,640
Yeah.

473
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,642
You know who I am?

474
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,051
Yes.

475
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:42,845
You planning on interviewing me?

476
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,521
You're on my list.

477
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:49,093
Well, let's get rolling. Where do I start?

478
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,730
Gang books? Mug shots? 211 reports?

479
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,292
If you want.

480
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:59,063
Come on, Diskant,
you've worked a homicide before.

481
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:02,230
I'm two for two.

482
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:06,941
Okay, two for two,
you got a ballistics report?

483
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:09,570
No. The bullets are still at the coroner's.

484
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:12,149
Yeah, but they're giving you
updates, right?

485
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,344
They tell you how many different calibers
they dug out of Washington?

486
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,251
-What do you want?
-How many?

487
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,188
Goodbye, Detective.

488
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:33,964
-Harry!
-Hey.

489
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:36,303
I thought you were dead.

490
00:39:57,662 --> 00:39:59,459
I'm from Vice Special.

491
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,964
Tom Ludlow.
I know who you are.

492
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:06,395
I handled your wife's autopsy.

493
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,199
-That was you?
-Mmm-hmm.

494
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:11,866
The asshole. Remember?

495
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,874
Right.

496
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:17,540
The guy who washed away all the hair
and fiber evidence.

497
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,115
The guy who wouldn't do a vaginal swab.

498
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,749
The guy who left me nothing to go on.

499
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,754
It's not my job to investigate adultery.

500
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,292
How can I help you?

501
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:27,587
How can I help you?

502
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:35,197
-Pulled these out of Washington?
-Yup.

503
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:37,129
Eighteen rounds.

504
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,294
Ten.45-caliber full metal jackets.

505
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:41,031
Seven 9-mil FMJs.

506
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,540
And a single.38 hollow-point
mushroomed against his scapula.

507
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,902
Serious overkill.

508
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,502
He must have really pissed off
the shooters.

509
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,046
Get what you're looking for?

510
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:57,878
Hi, I'm Detective Diskant.
We spoke on the phone earlier.

511
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,889
-I'm here for the ballistics evidence.
-How you doing?

512
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,288
Thank you.

513
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,084
When can I expect your report?

514
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:06,164
Give me about an hour or so.
The lab's backlogged today.

515
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:09,392
-Thanks. Can you fax it to my office?
-Sure can.

516
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:10,968
Thank you, Doc.

517
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,808
Diskant, talk to me.

518
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,947
You got three different calibers,
that means three weapons.

519
00:41:25,183 --> 00:41:27,981
What's your take on what went down
in that market?

520
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,215
Two bad guys come in the front door
to rob the place.

521
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:33,314
One of them sees the clerk,
cuts him in half.

522
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:34,585
The other one sees Washington,

523
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:37,821
whose weapon is already drawn,
empties his clip into him.

524
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:40,531
His buddy joins the party till he runs dry.

525
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,058
And one of them pulls a two-incher,

526
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:45,159
pumps a final "fuck you" round
into Washington's back.

527
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:47,801
They leave, you show up

528
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,267
after they're gone.

529
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,343
You got it all figured out.

530
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:00,978
I got your back here, but you got to keep
your distance and let me work this case.

531
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:03,646
No one's gonna find these assholes.
Is that what you need to hear from me?

532
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,484
Are you fucking kidding me?

533
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,287
They get a pass, you get a pass.
That's the deal, right?

534
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:11,021
What are you talking about,
the shooters get a pass?

535
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,029
I don't understand,
Clady said you were on board.

536
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,655
Not with this.

537
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:17,394
What's the deal, are you throwing
this case for a promotion?

538
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:19,163
If I were you,
I'd be more worried about yourself.

539
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:22,434
Hey, you piece of shit!
You got a 187 on a peace officer

540
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:24,372
and you're fucking letting
the suspects walk!

541
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:26,205
-You want these guys found?
-That doesn't piss you off?

542
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:28,108
-So they can put you at the store?
-Doesn't it piss you off?

543
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:29,578
Place you at the store
before the shooting?

544
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,273
You want to catch a felony
for obstruction?

545
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,977
If I say you weren't there,
you weren't there.

546
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:37,755
This is your mess and I'm cleaning it up.

547
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:39,323
Yeah, it pisses me off!

548
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:42,760
Diskant.

549
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:45,288
Yeah.

550
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:48,162
Yes. Hang on one second.

551
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:54,338
All right, go ahead.

552
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:58,468
All right, thank you. Bye-bye.

553
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,072
Fremont and Coates.

554
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:06,981
The lab found saliva on a cigarette butt
and the bandana outside the store.

555
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,677
DNA corresponds to those two names.

556
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:11,017
Congratulations, you IDed the shooters.

557
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,147
Yeah. Normally, I'd be pretty happy.

558
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:16,193
Pull their rap sheets. Give me copies.

559
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:17,522
I'll see you around.

560
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:26,600
Computer says you arrested these guys.

561
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:31,134
Fremont and Coates.

562
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:33,608
Good guys. Say hi for me.

563
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:35,077
You remember them?

564
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:38,581
Who can forget?
Heroin dealers with a taste for blood.

565
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:43,381
Came up from Belize to make a sale
and they liked the Southland so much,

566
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:44,477
they never left.

567
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:48,992
Yeah. We hooked these two fine
gentlemen on a rape-mutilation caper.

568
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:52,689
Seems they had a three-day hostage-fest
with this cute little Guatemalan chick

569
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,664
that they snatched up when
she was walking home from dental school.

570
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:56,734
They hurt her bad.

571
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:59,565
-Then why are they on the street?
-They walked from the beef.

572
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:03,801
One of our own felt we violated
Mr. Coates' and Mr. Fremont's civil rights

573
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:05,671
and told the City Attorney.

574
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:08,507
-Washington dimed you out?
-Yep.

575
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:11,811
Why do you think they put the dude
in Community Relations?

576
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,645
Are you shitting me?

577
00:44:13,752 --> 00:44:16,346
Washington kicked loose the very guys
who whacked him?

578
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:18,854
Damn ironic, isn't it?

579
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:22,017
Oh, guys! What is this, a garage sale?

580
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,789
How you doing, Lud? What's this? Why...

581
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:28,961
Lud, why do you have this?

582
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,433
Those are the shitbags
who popped Washington.

583
00:44:31,536 --> 00:44:32,867
Sarge, we can get these guys.

584
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:35,872
No, no.
Not if you want to keep your badge.

585
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:38,909
Besides, these two animals?
These guys, they'll take care of each other.

586
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,204
They'll be dead by the end of the week.

587
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:42,779
Probably shoot each other's fucking faces
off, knowing these two.

588
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:43,870
You know how that shit works.

589
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:47,509
This week's suspects,
next week's victims, right?

590
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:50,919
Yeah, right.

591
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,367
What the hell are you doing here, Tom?

592
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:08,769
Let's talk.

593
00:45:23,455 --> 00:45:25,389
I'm sick of this shit, man.

594
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,856
It's the same damn song for three years.

595
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:29,551
Crying about your wife.

596
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:31,793
She's gone, Tom.

597
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:35,928
What's it gonna take to
bring you back from Mars?

598
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,261
Have I ever asked you for anything?

599
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,895
You know what?
You ask me for shit all the time.

600
00:45:42,006 --> 00:45:44,702
Big things, Jack. Important things.

601
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,439
What's up, Tom?

602
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:51,507
Give me a green light to take out
the assholes who did Washington.

603
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:55,286
Come on, Jack. King's X.

604
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:58,212
What the hell is this?

605
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:01,755
I can lay them out like I did those Koreans,
but off the books.

606
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,660
I'm talking shovels and trash bags.
Who's gonna know? Who's gonna care?

607
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:07,163
The Koreans?

608
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,563
That... That was business.

609
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:14,303
This? This is some crazy bullshit rattling
around in that drunk-ass mind of yours.

610
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:18,472
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself, Tom! You're a mess!

611
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:22,069
When did you start drinking today?

612
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,774
Your little airplane bottles of vodka?

613
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,816
And you drove over here intoxicated.
You want a second DUI?

614
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:30,820
No one's going to fuck with me, Jack!
You're not listening to me!

615
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,355
You're not listening to me!

616
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:35,119
No, you listen to me!

617
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,990
This is much bigger than that.

618
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:41,462
Do you think Biggs is stupid?

619
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:44,558
He's got a PhD in catching cops slipping.

620
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:48,331
You know this. You know all this.

621
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:51,569
You got to hold your mud.

622
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:53,376
Can you do that?

623
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:58,314
It's time to turn the page
and close the book.

624
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:10,055
They took $200?

625
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:13,455
I... I forgot about it till I saw this.

626
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,295
That's the man.

627
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:18,360
That's him.

628
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:23,398
He took all my pay.
Said it was for the cookie jar.

629
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,843
The cookie jar?

630
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:28,136
That's what he said.

631
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:34,351
I'll be right back.

632
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,430
What do you want, Disco?

633
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:56,438
Washington was dirty.
He was a piece of shit.

634
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,841
Why are you telling me this?

635
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,536
I think you know why.

636
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,450
I know why.

637
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,255
-Are you recording this, huh?
-That's a new phone.

638
00:48:12,357 --> 00:48:14,689
You working for Internal Affairs?

639
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:16,384
You made one deal.

640
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:18,086
Maybe you made two.

641
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:21,256
Captain Biggs flip you
to the dark side, punk?

642
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,800
You know what?

643
00:48:25,837 --> 00:48:27,498
They're right about you.

644
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,367
You are fucking out there.

645
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:32,541
From now on, you stay away from me.
We don't talk.

646
00:48:32,644 --> 00:48:35,272
All right, hold on, Disco. Hold on. Hold on.

647
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,743
I gotta watch my own back these days,
you know?

648
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:42,112
Come on. Don't be mad.

649
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,014
Washington was dirty.

650
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,254
Hit me, princess.

651
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,922
Go on.

652
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:52,692
A couple things.

653
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:56,024
You know we found $50,000 in cash
on him at the store.

654
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:59,365
No, I didn't. That's a lot of cash,
but not in itself damning.

655
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,937
Oh, but this is.

656
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,597
Looks like an evidence tag.

657
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:04,140
I found it in Washington's truck.

658
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:07,302
I had SID scan it.
Corresponds to a kilo of heroin.

659
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:10,471
Guess who comes along
and signs out the dope?

660
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:12,149
Washington?

661
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,310
Washington signed out heroin
and returned brown sugar.

662
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:20,084
The guys who whacked him moved dope.

663
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:24,853
You know, Washington sprung them from
a rape beef on a technicality.

664
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:28,421
No, I did not know that.
Maybe they had a business arrangement.

665
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:31,134
Maybe it was a hit.

666
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:33,768
That would explain the heavy artillery.

667
00:49:35,873 --> 00:49:37,738
Washington deserved it, right?

668
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,673
He was dirty, so fuck him.

669
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,610
I feel much better
about the suspects walking.

670
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:45,376
And you, you must feel better too, right?

671
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,280
We're doing the right thing.

672
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:53,415
No shame if you want to take your pass.

673
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:00,824
This has to be you and me.

674
00:50:02,734 --> 00:50:05,396
Why do you think
we're in the goddamn bathroom?

675
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,121
This is it. Last known address.

676
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:04,795
Okay.

677
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:11,898
A family here now.
Our boys are long gone.

678
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:14,935
All right, Disco.

679
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:18,599
See those yahoos? I'm going to jam them.

680
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:22,577
And when I do, one of them is gonna bolt.
That's the one that's dirty.

681
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:25,439
You bored or something?

682
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,212
This is their hood.

683
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:29,946
Anyone knows Fremont and Coates,
they do.

684
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:35,119
Hold this, mija.

685
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,697
Get him.

686
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,531
Get out of here, Supercut!

687
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,608
Fuck off.
You're in the wrong neighborhood, homes.

688
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:00,974
Watch out! Watch out!

689
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:03,454
Move!

690
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:09,254
Yo, run, homie!

691
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:34,017
Yo, Spencer.

692
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:16,388
I had him.

693
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:19,759
Why you running, man?

694
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:23,129
Hey, get me the fuck down,
man. This shit's cutting me, man!

695
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:25,797
-Get me the fuck down, man!
-What else?

696
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:27,928
What else? What else?

697
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:30,900
What the fuck are you doing?

698
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:33,805
So, what do they call ya?

699
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:36,277
They call me...
They call me fucking Quicks, man.

700
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,871
-Quicks? Not quick enough.
-Quick.

701
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:40,177
Hey, get me the fuck down, homes.

702
00:53:40,284 --> 00:53:42,013
Please, man,
this shit's cutting me, dawg.

703
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,677
Fremont and Coates.

704
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:45,756
They were staying across from the house
you were partying at.

705
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,016
You know them?

706
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:49,092
I don't fucking know them fools, man!

707
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:51,093
I'm a fucking Southsider, all right, ese?

708
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:53,060
I don't be fucking party
with no brothers and shit.

709
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:54,153
Man, what the fuck you doing?

710
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:56,290
-They're from Belize.
-Shit!

711
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,231
-Who knows them? Who knows them?
-All right!

712
00:53:58,336 --> 00:53:59,428
Who knows them?

713
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:02,404
Look, mother... Hey, motherfucker,
come on. All right, dawg. Look, look.

714
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:06,374
Check this out, man.
There's a baller cat on San Pedro, all right?

715
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:09,002
Dude's name is Grill, man.
He's from 40s town, ese.

716
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:10,444
-Grill. 40s town.
-All right. Yeah.

717
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:13,278
Grill, man. That motherfucker,
he knows all of them, all right, man.

718
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,079
Hey! Hey!

719
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:16,486
What about him?

720
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,418
-He's lucky he's not going to jail.
-Hey. Come on, man.

721
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:19,819
-I'll run Grill through CALGANG.
-Hey!

722
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,323
-See if I can get an address.
-Hey, fucking white boys.

723
00:54:21,726 --> 00:54:23,421
He's way better than you!

724
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:26,820
Housemates, report to the backyard.

725
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:29,229
This is a badminton
challenge between us

726
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:31,563
and the original cast of Drawn Together.

727
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:33,569
Prepare to be transformed
into a bunch of losers.

728
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,466
Fuck, man.

729
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,936
Let's make these guys eat shuttlecock.

730
00:54:39,479 --> 00:54:42,175
-Hey, can we get this game going already?
-Shit!

731
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:44,146
Police! Drop it!

732
00:54:46,086 --> 00:54:47,519
Get on your face!

733
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,485
What the fuck I do, man?

734
00:54:52,592 --> 00:54:53,718
Get your ass in here, Disco.

735
00:54:53,827 --> 00:54:55,124
Somebody tell me
what the fuck I did, man.

736
00:54:55,228 --> 00:54:56,456
Shut up.

737
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:24,249
Shit!

738
00:55:26,993 --> 00:55:29,154
You got two strikes, Grill.

739
00:55:29,262 --> 00:55:32,356
This is three strikes. Twenty-five to life.

740
00:55:32,532 --> 00:55:34,762
That ain't my fucking shit. Fuck you.

741
00:55:34,868 --> 00:55:38,634
You put that shit there.
Dirty-ass, punk-ass cop.

742
00:55:45,745 --> 00:55:47,076
Ah, man!

743
00:55:47,714 --> 00:55:49,682
Whoa! Oh! What are you...

744
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:52,617
-Whoa. Whoa! Ludlow!
-Shit!

745
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:54,152
What the fuck, man?

746
00:55:55,922 --> 00:55:58,550
Whoa! Whoa! Stop!

747
00:55:59,325 --> 00:56:02,226
Fuck, man. Listen to your boy, man. Shit!

748
00:56:02,328 --> 00:56:03,625
Don't you have to ask him
something first?

749
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:06,028
Homie right, man. Aren't you
supposed to ask me some shit first?

750
00:56:06,132 --> 00:56:07,861
Fremont and Coates, where they at?

751
00:56:07,967 --> 00:56:10,060
Fuck, man. Stop hitting me
on my fucking head first

752
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,501
and I'll tell you.

753
00:56:12,472 --> 00:56:14,872
Where do they fucking stay?

754
00:56:17,277 --> 00:56:18,972
You're fucking crazy, man.

755
00:56:19,078 --> 00:56:20,136
I don't know where they at.

756
00:56:20,246 --> 00:56:22,942
Cats have been banned from the hood
for a minute, man.

757
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:25,210
If I catch them slipping,
I'm gonna bust they motherfucking head.

758
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:28,776
Answer the fucking question!
How do we find them?

759
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:34,153
The only cats I know that know them
is up in the County, man. High power.

760
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,525
-I'm going to book you into County.
-For what, man? For what?

761
00:56:38,698 --> 00:56:41,462
Talk to your friends, find me Fremont and
Coates and you'll be out by tomorrow.

762
00:56:41,568 --> 00:56:43,695
Otherwise, I'm gonna book you
for the dope and AK.

763
00:56:43,803 --> 00:56:45,737
Fuck, man! Fuck, man!

764
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:53,074
I ain't no fucking snitch, man.

765
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:56,114
I know that.
There won't be no jacket, no papers.

766
00:56:56,716 --> 00:56:58,013
It's just you and me.

767
00:56:58,117 --> 00:57:00,085
Fuck, fuck, fuck, man!

768
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:04,119
Come on, they ain't nothing to you.
I want them.

769
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:07,589
All right, man. Fuck it, man.

770
00:57:49,535 --> 00:57:51,332
Mrs. Washington.

771
00:57:55,008 --> 00:57:57,033
Can we talk outside?

772
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:10,145
Terrence had $50,000 in cash on him.

773
00:58:11,224 --> 00:58:14,955
His death might be more than just
wrong place, wrong time.

774
00:58:16,596 --> 00:58:18,029
Might be?

775
00:58:18,998 --> 00:58:22,297
How many people knew he was
talking to Internal Affairs?

776
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,067
My husband had a good heart.

777
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,239
And when he started listening to it,
he became a pariah.

778
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:32,674
His eyes opened.

779
00:58:33,212 --> 00:58:34,907
When will your eyes open?

780
00:58:36,649 --> 00:58:39,379
Terrence always said
you were the worst one.

781
00:58:40,353 --> 00:58:44,119
Because with all the shit going on
around you, you choose not to see.

782
00:58:44,223 --> 00:58:46,987
-Look, I came here to help you.
-Help me?

783
00:58:47,093 --> 00:58:49,755
You came to help yourself sleep at night.

784
00:58:49,862 --> 00:58:52,092
That $50,000,
you think Terrence was stupid?

785
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:56,225
He knew he had a bull's-eye on his back
the second he went to Captain Biggs.

786
00:58:56,736 --> 00:58:58,363
So we sold our house.

787
00:58:59,472 --> 00:59:02,100
We were leaving Friday for the Bahamas.

788
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:04,676
To start over.

789
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:08,177
Silly of us, wasn't it?

790
00:59:11,017 --> 00:59:12,985
Anything else, Detective?

791
00:59:15,188 --> 00:59:16,314
No.

792
00:59:24,964 --> 00:59:26,693
Lud!

793
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,397
What the fuck?

794
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:33,630
-Hey. How's Complaints?
-Just missed your wife.

795
00:59:33,773 --> 00:59:37,209
-Oh. She was here? That's cute.
-Yeah.

796
00:59:38,711 --> 00:59:40,372
I got something for you.

797
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:49,016
That's for you.

798
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:51,821
-Is that it?
-That's it.

799
00:59:51,924 --> 00:59:53,359
Yeah. That's it.

800
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:53,848
Yeah. That's it.

801
00:59:54,427 --> 00:59:56,190
You keep it.
A nice little souvenir for yourself.

802
00:59:56,295 --> 00:59:58,058
But, Tom, this is...

803
00:59:58,898 --> 01:00:00,525
I mean, it's over.

804
01:00:04,303 --> 01:00:06,203
Tom, this is over.

805
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:11,235
We got your back, Tom.

806
01:00:38,438 --> 01:00:41,100
-Yeah.
-It's your man in high power.

807
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,932
-I got that name.
-Fire away.

808
01:00:43,042 --> 01:00:46,443
It's this OG dude.
Sell a little of this, little of that.

809
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,647
Drive an old-ass Cadillac.

810
01:00:48,748 --> 01:00:51,876
-Name.
-Scribble. They call him Scribble.

811
01:00:52,285 --> 01:00:55,345
His real name's Winston or some shit.
I don't know.

812
01:00:55,588 --> 01:00:58,557
-Man, get me up out of here.
-It's on its way.

813
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:01,087
I can't believe this shit worked.

814
01:01:01,194 --> 01:01:03,059
Scribble. It's catchy.

815
01:01:03,262 --> 01:01:05,230
I got a Metro unit tailing him.

816
01:01:06,232 --> 01:01:07,597
Go get him, Disco.

817
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:10,899
-Make me proud.
-You're not coming?

818
01:01:18,845 --> 01:01:22,178
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Watch it! Watch it!
-You married, Diskant?

819
01:01:23,382 --> 01:01:26,249
Engaged. And I'd like to see her again.

820
01:01:26,953 --> 01:01:29,148
Hey, you ever hear of something called
the "cookie jar"

821
01:01:29,255 --> 01:01:32,554
in reference to corruption, shakedowns,
Serpico shit?

822
01:01:32,925 --> 01:01:34,051
No. Why?

823
01:01:34,193 --> 01:01:35,888
A complaint I'm working on.

824
01:01:35,995 --> 01:01:37,587
We're eastbound
on Vernon passing Fig.

825
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:39,130
Do you want us to jam them?

826
01:01:39,232 --> 01:01:42,224
That's a negative. Just keep eyes on
and call it out. We're en route.

827
01:01:42,335 --> 01:01:43,802
Watch the crosswalk!

828
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:45,337
Hey!

829
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,166
There he is.

830
01:01:49,509 --> 01:01:51,033
We got him. Break off.

831
01:01:51,144 --> 01:01:52,441
That's a rog.

832
01:01:54,881 --> 01:01:55,848
What the fuck, nigga?

833
01:01:55,948 --> 01:01:57,415
Dub-C, you better duck, nigga

834
01:01:57,517 --> 01:01:58,484
Shit.

835
01:02:03,623 --> 01:02:06,387
I was raised in the hood
called what the fuck, nigga

836
01:02:09,228 --> 01:02:11,162
Hands where I can see them!

837
01:02:15,968 --> 01:02:18,436
What the hell y'all supposed to be, man?
Narcs?

838
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:20,398
Yeah, we're narcs.

839
01:02:21,073 --> 01:02:24,440
Look how pinned out your eyes are.
Taking a little off the top?

840
01:02:24,544 --> 01:02:26,239
Little jones maintenance?

841
01:02:26,646 --> 01:02:27,738
You need to kick that shit.

842
01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:30,145
I got a lawyer. You might want to talk
to him. I got his card.

843
01:02:30,249 --> 01:02:32,410
You, wake up. Nothing's happened yet.

844
01:02:32,652 --> 01:02:35,553
But FYI,
you know you got a no-bail warrant.

845
01:02:36,189 --> 01:02:38,589
I put the cuffs on now,
you're locked up until the apocalypse.

846
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:41,023
Well, whatever, man.
I mean, take me in right now, dawg.

847
01:02:41,127 --> 01:02:42,253
I mean, read me my Mirandas.

848
01:02:42,361 --> 01:02:44,693
Put your hands back on the fucking wheel!

849
01:02:44,797 --> 01:02:46,822
Yo, two for two!
Watch those fucking jokers.

850
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,231
Get back! Get the fuck back!

851
01:02:49,402 --> 01:02:50,835
What the fuck you looking at, white boy?

852
01:02:50,937 --> 01:02:52,905
Get the fuck back!

853
01:02:53,005 --> 01:02:55,166
You really want to kick heroin in County?

854
01:02:55,274 --> 01:02:58,539
Want to see the judge all sick,
shitting and puking yourself?

855
01:02:58,644 --> 01:03:01,272
That would look real good. And for what?

856
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,211
You're just a rung on a ladder
I'm climbing.

857
01:03:03,316 --> 01:03:04,613
What ladder, man?

858
01:03:05,484 --> 01:03:08,112
How do I find Fremont and Coates?

859
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:14,223
Look, I ain't got no love for them
banana boat motherfuckers, man.

860
01:03:14,327 --> 01:03:15,726
But them dudes are straight monsters.

861
01:03:15,828 --> 01:03:18,058
They'll put me in a box
if they think I'm snitching.

862
01:03:18,164 --> 01:03:20,098
I'm not asking to finger the guys
in open court.

863
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:21,894
I just want to find them.

864
01:03:22,001 --> 01:03:24,299
Once I do, you're out of the mix.

865
01:03:25,271 --> 01:03:27,171
I ain't seen them in a week, man.

866
01:03:27,273 --> 01:03:28,467
You got a number?

867
01:03:28,574 --> 01:03:32,635
No, I ain't got no number.
Them dudes drop phones all the time.

868
01:03:32,745 --> 01:03:34,474
They call me, man.

869
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,673
Look man, your man making me nervous
back here. Could you...

870
01:03:36,782 --> 01:03:38,340
Look at me. Look at me!

871
01:03:38,884 --> 01:03:42,615
You wanna see that judge
or you gonna help me find them?

872
01:03:43,923 --> 01:03:48,383
Look, I did business with them
one time in El Sereno.

873
01:03:49,762 --> 01:03:53,198
Little bitty-ass house way up in the hills.
That's it.

874
01:03:56,402 --> 01:03:57,801
Show me.

875
01:03:57,903 --> 01:04:00,565
You expect me to leave my car
in the hood, man?

876
01:04:48,254 --> 01:04:49,881
Someone had a party.

877
01:05:14,347 --> 01:05:15,644
Smell that?

878
01:05:45,444 --> 01:05:47,071
Want me to put it out?

879
01:05:49,515 --> 01:05:51,710
No. Get the murder book.

880
01:05:58,457 --> 01:06:00,254
This is Fremont.

881
01:06:03,262 --> 01:06:07,028
And this is his buddy, Coates.

882
01:06:09,702 --> 01:06:10,896
We found them.

883
01:06:11,003 --> 01:06:11,970
Great.

884
01:06:12,605 --> 01:06:14,197
Case closed.

885
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,237
These guys have been here a while.
There's no way they killed Washington.

886
01:06:18,344 --> 01:06:19,641
You think?

887
01:06:20,713 --> 01:06:23,079
Fuck you. I'm doing my best.

888
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,881
If Fremont and Coates
didn't kill Washington, who did?

889
01:06:26,986 --> 01:06:27,953
Who're we chasing?

890
01:06:28,087 --> 01:06:29,577
The assholes who smoked these guys,

891
01:06:29,688 --> 01:06:32,213
harvested their DNA and planted it
in the market. That's who.

892
01:06:32,324 --> 01:06:35,623
I'm with you.
But why do you frame two dead dudes?

893
01:06:37,129 --> 01:06:38,824
We're going to ask them.

894
01:06:40,466 --> 01:06:41,763
Let's go.

895
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:51,175
What's up, man?

896
01:06:51,277 --> 01:06:52,938
You know there's coyotes out here
and shit, right?

897
01:06:53,045 --> 01:06:54,478
Y'all been gone a minute.

898
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:56,047
You know these guys?

899
01:06:58,417 --> 01:07:00,647
No, man. I ain't never seen these dudes.

900
01:07:02,054 --> 01:07:04,887
Look, if Fremont and Coates call you,
set up a meeting.

901
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:07,982
You tell them I can do for them
what Washington can't anymore.

902
01:07:08,093 --> 01:07:09,993
They'll know what you mean.

903
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:16,461
All right, man. I'll hook it up.

904
01:07:17,536 --> 01:07:19,868
-Will you take me back to my car?
-Sure.

905
01:07:42,795 --> 01:07:45,730
-Have a nice swim?
-Yeah.

906
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,033
I hope you guys are playing nice
with the new girl.

907
01:07:51,837 --> 01:07:54,305
-Is Tom taking care of you?
-I take care of him.

908
01:07:54,406 --> 01:07:55,805
Yeah?
-Yeah.

909
01:07:56,108 --> 01:07:57,200
How's Complaints, Lud?

910
01:07:57,309 --> 01:07:58,276
Oh!

911
01:07:59,678 --> 01:08:02,579
I'd rather scrape up body parts
at a traffic collision.

912
01:08:02,681 --> 01:08:04,706
See, Tommy falls apart
when he's not chasing bad guys.

913
01:08:04,817 --> 01:08:05,806
He's always been like that.

914
01:08:05,918 --> 01:08:08,079
He was born without the fear gene.
I could tell you some stories.

915
01:08:08,187 --> 01:08:10,917
-Tell me!
-No, no, we don't kiss and tell around here.

916
01:08:11,023 --> 01:08:13,423
Now, I got the classic Tom Ludlow story.

917
01:08:13,526 --> 01:08:16,359
When he was a rookie,
I took him under my wing.

918
01:08:16,462 --> 01:08:19,954
It was a Friday night, and we're in
Crip City, it's a project in Watts.

919
01:08:20,065 --> 01:08:22,397
Lots of dope, shootings,
whatever, what have you.

920
01:08:22,501 --> 01:08:25,800
So, we get this call to shut down
this house party.

921
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:28,269
And Tom, he's like the saltiest boot ever,

922
01:08:28,374 --> 01:08:31,673
so I figured, you know, let's...
Let's give him a lesson in humility.

923
01:08:31,777 --> 01:08:33,642
So I send him in there.

924
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:35,003
Alone.

925
01:08:35,114 --> 01:08:37,275
And all of a sudden,
all hell breaks loose, right?

926
01:08:37,383 --> 01:08:41,114
They got guys coming out the doors,
homeboys flying out the windows...

927
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,517
Everybody's screaming inside.

928
01:08:42,621 --> 01:08:44,953
I rush in, I charge in,
and there's Tom, busting heads.

929
01:08:45,057 --> 01:08:47,150
They wouldn't turn the music down.

930
01:08:48,794 --> 01:08:50,159
Tom's always gonna be Tom.

931
01:08:50,262 --> 01:08:52,992
He's like a guided missile.
Locks on, that's it.

932
01:09:13,586 --> 01:09:16,020
-Yeah?
-Hey, so I just talked to Scribble.

933
01:09:16,956 --> 01:09:20,414
Freemont and Coates,
or whoever they are, want to meet us.

934
01:09:21,527 --> 01:09:23,495
-When?
-Tonight.

935
01:09:25,264 --> 01:09:27,391
I'll see you in Vice in an hour.

936
01:09:38,744 --> 01:09:40,541
I know it's late. I'm sorry.

937
01:09:42,448 --> 01:09:44,109
I wanted you to have this.

938
01:09:44,216 --> 01:09:45,683
And that is?

939
01:09:46,885 --> 01:09:49,321
It's the video of your husband's murder.

940
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:49,755
It's the video of your husband's murder.

941
01:09:49,755 --> 01:09:51,382
It shows everything.

942
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:54,050
Why are you doing this?

943
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,428
Because I know how not knowing hurts.

944
01:09:58,964 --> 01:10:01,865
When I lost my wife,
she was with another man.

945
01:10:04,103 --> 01:10:07,402
She had a blood clot in her brain
and it burst.

946
01:10:10,042 --> 01:10:13,011
The bastard dumped her outside
a hospital and...

947
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,607
She died alone on the sidewalk.

948
01:10:20,552 --> 01:10:24,511
Linda, I'm sorry
for wanting to hurt Terrence

949
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:27,417
and I'm sorry for your loss.

950
01:10:28,994 --> 01:10:31,588
I want you to know he didn't die alone,

951
01:10:31,997 --> 01:10:34,693
and that the men who killed him
are gonna pay.

952
01:10:45,911 --> 01:10:47,845
That won't bring him back.

953
01:10:49,815 --> 01:10:51,976
And that won't bring your wife back.

954
01:10:53,552 --> 01:10:54,849
I don't care.

955
01:10:57,723 --> 01:10:59,350
Not in my name.

956
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:03,090
Please. Not in my name.

957
01:11:05,597 --> 01:11:07,565
Blood doesn't wash away blood.

958
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:11,401
Shouldn't we roll with backup?

959
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:14,898
-Fuck backup.
-What? Why?

960
01:11:16,308 --> 01:11:18,139
What do you think is gonna
happen tonight?

961
01:11:18,243 --> 01:11:19,972
You think I'm gonna throw the cuffs
on these boys,

962
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:22,547
drag them back to the barn
and write it up?

963
01:11:25,784 --> 01:11:27,115
Here's the deal.

964
01:11:27,619 --> 01:11:30,713
I'm going out there
and you're going home.

965
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:34,191
And we are never,
ever gonna discuss any of this again.

966
01:11:34,293 --> 01:11:35,726
What? What do you mean?

967
01:11:35,828 --> 01:11:40,265
It means Fremont and Coates never
existed, and we never met.

968
01:11:43,402 --> 01:11:45,370
I'm not going home tonight, Tom.

969
01:11:45,971 --> 01:11:47,063
Look, Paul.

970
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:52,306
This thing you want, that you think
you want, you don't want.

971
01:11:52,945 --> 01:11:55,778
You don't know who I am or what I want.

972
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:58,383
Who are you to judge me?

973
01:12:00,619 --> 01:12:02,678
You want to be a gunfighter, huh?

974
01:12:16,268 --> 01:12:17,735
Then let's do it.

975
01:12:29,948 --> 01:12:31,813
Back on the night watch, Tom?

976
01:12:33,685 --> 01:12:37,416
You two keep being seen all over town.

977
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:40,147
Tom?

978
01:12:40,726 --> 01:12:43,422
Did you really think I was gonna
do nothing about you?

979
01:12:43,529 --> 01:12:45,963
If you are gonna do something, do it now.

980
01:12:50,035 --> 01:12:52,902
I know you want my scalp
nailed to your wall.

981
01:12:53,005 --> 01:12:55,166
But then who's gonna go
where the law won't?

982
01:12:55,274 --> 01:12:56,639
You, Captain?

983
01:12:57,743 --> 01:13:01,679
You? You going to clean up the needles
and baby parts?

984
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:03,507
No.

985
01:13:03,782 --> 01:13:05,079
You need me.

986
01:13:05,184 --> 01:13:08,176
All you company men,
you hate me, but you need me.

987
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:13,617
Ludlow,

988
01:13:14,226 --> 01:13:17,593
maybe you're right.
Maybe we do need you.

989
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:20,696
But goddamn if you don't need me, son.

990
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:28,804
Hey, Detective.

991
01:13:30,142 --> 01:13:34,238
Did you ever ask yourself if Washington's
dead because he was dirty

992
01:13:34,713 --> 01:13:36,408
or because he came clean?

993
01:13:48,827 --> 01:13:50,624
Swap your rounds out.

994
01:13:52,064 --> 01:13:53,998
We don't want the coroner
digging department-issue

995
01:13:54,099 --> 01:13:55,862
ammo out of these assholes.

996
01:13:58,270 --> 01:13:59,897
Use the gloves.

997
01:14:01,773 --> 01:14:04,833
Jesus.
These are some serious man stoppers.

998
01:14:07,012 --> 01:14:09,378
So we're just gonna go in there
and kill them?

999
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,017
No. I'm gonna ask them some questions.

1000
01:14:15,087 --> 01:14:16,952
Then we're gonna kill them.

1001
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,097
Fucking time, man.

1002
01:15:04,569 --> 01:15:05,866
We good?

1003
01:15:07,072 --> 01:15:11,031
You know it's some bullshit, right?
These dudes is monsters, man.

1004
01:15:11,143 --> 01:15:14,909
I mean, if they can't fuck it, rob it or kill it,
they don't want it.

1005
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:19,447
Ready?

1006
01:15:20,018 --> 01:15:20,985
Yeah.

1007
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:23,154
Make the introduction.

1008
01:15:23,255 --> 01:15:25,883
All right. I tried to tell you.

1009
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,326
Feeling like Vietnam

1010
01:15:28,427 --> 01:15:30,725
Murdering Uncle Toms
I'm crunk like I'm Lil John

1011
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:31,921
I'm a wizard waving...

1012
01:15:52,651 --> 01:15:54,585
Get the fuck in here.

1013
01:15:55,687 --> 01:15:58,019
You. Move to the fucking wall.

1014
01:15:58,357 --> 01:16:01,485
What the hell is this?
You know we're cops. Deal with it.

1015
01:16:01,593 --> 01:16:04,562
-They cool, LaShawn.
-Shut the fuck up, Scribble.

1016
01:16:06,198 --> 01:16:07,324
Get in there.

1017
01:16:07,432 --> 01:16:10,094
Yo! You think I'm fucking playing?

1018
01:16:10,202 --> 01:16:13,296
Get your ass against the wall
before you find your brains up there.

1019
01:16:13,405 --> 01:16:15,430
We're here to do business.
You want to feel me up,

1020
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:17,167
come on and try it.

1021
01:16:17,476 --> 01:16:19,774
Oh, shit. You want to feel his shit?

1022
01:16:20,412 --> 01:16:22,710
'Cause he ain't taking it out for you.

1023
01:16:23,615 --> 01:16:27,210
Chill the fuck out, LaShawn.
Scribble say they good.

1024
01:16:27,319 --> 01:16:29,412
Scribs, what's up with these fools, man?

1025
01:16:29,521 --> 01:16:31,216
They good, man. They cool.

1026
01:16:31,423 --> 01:16:32,447
Nigga, take a seat.

1027
01:16:32,557 --> 01:16:34,115
Get the fuck in there!

1028
01:16:36,194 --> 01:16:37,661
You want a drink?

1029
01:16:38,163 --> 01:16:39,790
No, we're good.

1030
01:16:42,601 --> 01:16:45,764
Man, we got the one-time up in here.

1031
01:16:46,605 --> 01:16:48,937
-Mmm-hmm.
-Motherfucking po-po.

1032
01:16:49,608 --> 01:16:51,872
Is there any square cops out there?

1033
01:16:52,144 --> 01:16:54,112
Or is everybody out for theirs?

1034
01:16:55,213 --> 01:16:58,148
Everyone's out for theirs.
Way of the world.

1035
01:16:58,550 --> 01:17:01,178
Dude, cops are like weeds.

1036
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:03,547
You pull one out,

1037
01:17:04,256 --> 01:17:06,190
and two more fucking grow back.

1038
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:08,088
Well, Washington got greedy.

1039
01:17:11,563 --> 01:17:12,530
Don't shoot me now.

1040
01:17:12,631 --> 01:17:15,122
I'm just gonna get something
out of my pocket.

1041
01:17:19,938 --> 01:17:21,735
This is just a sample.

1042
01:17:23,275 --> 01:17:24,936
We're all about weight.

1043
01:17:25,043 --> 01:17:27,876
We can help you transport,
let you know if there's heat,

1044
01:17:27,979 --> 01:17:30,277
let you know if you're selling
to a narc or a snitch.

1045
01:17:30,382 --> 01:17:33,010
Or bust people and sell you their shit.

1046
01:17:44,463 --> 01:17:46,590
We all about weight, too.

1047
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,058
Look at that shit. That's sexy right there.

1048
01:17:52,471 --> 01:17:56,066
That's better than pussy.
That's better than money.

1049
01:17:57,142 --> 01:17:59,235
That ain't no Mexican tar, neither.

1050
01:17:59,377 --> 01:18:02,835
That's that worldwide-war-on-terror
dope, nigga.

1051
01:18:03,548 --> 01:18:05,743
Pure Afghan, homie.

1052
01:18:06,985 --> 01:18:08,976
Blood, we know this cat.

1053
01:18:09,554 --> 01:18:11,078
It's the same motherfucker
that was in the market

1054
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:13,521
the day we pushed Washington's
wig back.

1055
01:18:15,293 --> 01:18:16,487
Hell, yeah.

1056
01:18:17,729 --> 01:18:19,697
That was you, right?

1057
01:18:20,165 --> 01:18:23,396
Come on, man. Cool, man.
Y'all just chill out, man.

1058
01:18:23,502 --> 01:18:25,231
All right?
I see where this is going, all right?

1059
01:18:25,337 --> 01:18:27,635
Everybody just be cool, man.
We got all these drugs here.

1060
01:18:27,739 --> 01:18:29,639
Let's just get high.
I'm gonna pour me some...

1061
01:18:29,741 --> 01:18:31,538
Shut your fat ass up.

1062
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,548
That's what you here for, dawg?

1063
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:43,510
You here to get some get-back for that
sorry-ass nigga, Detective Ludlow?

1064
01:18:45,323 --> 01:18:47,587
No. You guys did me a favor.

1065
01:18:48,994 --> 01:18:53,260
So you know who I am
and I know who you're not.

1066
01:18:53,965 --> 01:18:57,526
If you're not Fremont and Coates,
then who the hell are you?

1067
01:18:59,571 --> 01:19:00,663
Who are we,

1068
01:19:01,473 --> 01:19:02,906
Detective?

1069
01:19:04,843 --> 01:19:06,811
We straight nightmares.

1070
01:19:07,746 --> 01:19:11,443
We are walking, talking,
exigent circumstances.

1071
01:19:13,585 --> 01:19:15,712
Ludlow, wait! I know these guys!

1072
01:19:35,307 --> 01:19:36,899
It's over, Detective!

1073
01:19:38,076 --> 01:19:39,134
Shit.

1074
01:19:39,844 --> 01:19:41,675
I'm gonna do your bitch-ass
like my nigga did your partner!

1075
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,213
Hold on, Diskant. Hang on.

1076
01:19:43,315 --> 01:19:45,146
Scribble, what the fuck is you doing?

1077
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:47,052
Nigga, pick that gun up
and blast that motherfucker!

1078
01:19:47,052 --> 01:19:47,814
Nigga, pick that gun up
and blast that motherfucker!

1079
01:19:47,919 --> 01:19:49,284
It ain't me, dawg.

1080
01:19:51,256 --> 01:19:53,383
The next one's in your dome, nigga!

1081
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,327
Winston, don't do it.

1082
01:19:57,429 --> 01:20:01,661
Winston? Winston, what the fuck is that?
That's your slave name, nigga?

1083
01:20:01,766 --> 01:20:04,530
Do it, nigga! Man, kill that white boy!

1084
01:20:04,636 --> 01:20:07,127
You white, man? Kill that white boy!

1085
01:20:08,073 --> 01:20:09,904
I can't, man.

1086
01:20:10,008 --> 01:20:11,339
Fuck this nigga!

1087
01:20:13,878 --> 01:20:15,937
I'm out, dawg. Cover me. Come on.

1088
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,447
Hang on, Diskant.

1089
01:20:23,755 --> 01:20:24,949
Hang on.

1090
01:22:33,251 --> 01:22:35,776
-Let me see you.
-Why are you crying?

1091
01:22:36,855 --> 01:22:38,686
Take that off.

1092
01:22:43,294 --> 01:22:44,761
Sit down, Tom.

1093
01:22:47,565 --> 01:22:49,328
It went bad, Grace.

1094
01:22:49,934 --> 01:22:52,402
I know. I know.

1095
01:22:57,776 --> 01:22:59,573
I should have gone alone.

1096
01:23:00,078 --> 01:23:02,273
I took a boy to a gunfight.

1097
01:23:04,849 --> 01:23:06,476
Why are you crying?

1098
01:23:07,152 --> 01:23:08,619
What's wrong?

1099
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:10,517
What's wrong?

1100
01:23:14,726 --> 01:23:16,489
In our coverage
of tonight's top story,

1101
01:23:16,594 --> 01:23:20,860
Detective Tom Ludlow, an 18-year veteran
of the Los Angeles Police Department,

1102
01:23:20,965 --> 01:23:23,195
is wanted in connection with
the shooting deaths

1103
01:23:23,301 --> 01:23:26,964
of two undercover deputy sheriffs
in the early hours of the morning.

1104
01:23:27,105 --> 01:23:31,235
Officials have yet to confirm a third victim,
who may also be a peace officer.

1105
01:23:31,342 --> 01:23:33,902
In addition, they have stated
Detective Ludlow was off-duty

1106
01:23:34,012 --> 01:23:35,274
at the time of the shootings,

1107
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:37,780
and is the only suspect
in yet another tragedy...

1108
01:23:37,882 --> 01:23:40,248
-Cops.
...in the Los Angeles law enforcement.

1109
01:23:40,351 --> 01:23:41,375
Reports continue
to bring you...

1110
01:23:41,486 --> 01:23:44,387
How do they know that?
That they were cops?

1111
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:47,690
I just left. It's on the news?

1112
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:51,128
Did you do it?

1113
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:54,324
Of course you did it.

1114
01:23:54,432 --> 01:23:57,959
I had no idea they were deputies.
But I should have.

1115
01:23:58,069 --> 01:24:01,038
"Exigent circumstances." Jesus.

1116
01:24:02,474 --> 01:24:04,066
What is wrong with you?

1117
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:08,835
Huh? Why can't you have a normal life
like everyone else?

1118
01:24:08,947 --> 01:24:11,211
-I should go.
-No. No.

1119
01:24:11,316 --> 01:24:12,408
You're not going out there.

1120
01:24:12,517 --> 01:24:15,281
This is gonna be a nightmare, Grace.
I've got to go.

1121
01:24:15,386 --> 01:24:18,480
No. No, Tom. This door is staying closed.

1122
01:24:19,324 --> 01:24:22,054
Every cop in LA is hunting for you.
You want to get killed?

1123
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,890
Grace. Grace.

1124
01:24:24,996 --> 01:24:27,726
You need to get away from me. Okay?

1125
01:24:27,832 --> 01:24:29,527
You need to get far away.

1126
01:24:31,769 --> 01:24:33,703
Everything I touch dies.

1127
01:24:35,507 --> 01:24:36,906
Down on the fucking floor!

1128
01:24:37,008 --> 01:24:39,636
-On the fucking floor, now!
-I'm not resisting!

1129
01:24:41,846 --> 01:24:43,074
Don't say a fucking word.

1130
01:24:43,181 --> 01:24:45,342
-No, please.
-Shut up.

1131
01:24:47,385 --> 01:24:48,511
Get up.

1132
01:24:52,657 --> 01:24:53,954
You're an asshole. You're going down.

1133
01:24:54,058 --> 01:24:56,925
Killed two fucking cops.
What's the matter with you?

1134
01:24:58,429 --> 01:25:00,556
Get that piece of shit out of here.

1135
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:16,372
-Downtown's the other way.
-We're not going downtown.

1136
01:25:16,481 --> 01:25:17,914
Where are we going?

1137
01:25:20,251 --> 01:25:22,048
That bitch of yours is fine.

1138
01:25:22,587 --> 01:25:24,578
-What?
-So is Washington's widow.

1139
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:27,890
You're fucking them both, huh?

1140
01:25:29,093 --> 01:25:31,857
-Which one you feeling, Dante?
-I like Linda.

1141
01:25:31,963 --> 01:25:34,454
You shouldn't have given her
the video, Lud.

1142
01:25:34,766 --> 01:25:37,132
What the fuck were you thinking?

1143
01:25:37,235 --> 01:25:38,964
You handed that bitch a death sentence.

1144
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:40,970
What the hell are you talking about?

1145
01:25:41,072 --> 01:25:42,767
We've been watching you, asshole.

1146
01:25:42,874 --> 01:25:46,037
How many times were you told
to let it go? Hmm? How many?

1147
01:25:46,144 --> 01:25:47,236
Cool, homes. Don't get him going.

1148
01:25:47,345 --> 01:25:49,643
Hey, fuck him!
Look what he's making us do.

1149
01:25:49,747 --> 01:25:51,146
Smug fucking punk.

1150
01:25:51,783 --> 01:25:53,444
Did you figure it out, Lud? Huh?

1151
01:25:53,551 --> 01:25:56,145
How did Fremont and Coates make it
to the market that day?

1152
01:25:56,254 --> 01:25:59,587
After Washington got them kicked loose,
you picked them back up.

1153
01:25:59,691 --> 01:26:01,625
Took them to the hills
and popped their melons, right?

1154
01:26:01,726 --> 01:26:04,627
You should be a detective.
We took some DNA samples first.

1155
01:26:04,729 --> 01:26:08,460
Got a little hair, little spit. Voila!
Fremont and Coates did it.

1156
01:26:08,566 --> 01:26:11,000
Who signed out the dope?
It wasn't Washington.

1157
01:26:11,102 --> 01:26:12,126
You.

1158
01:26:12,236 --> 01:26:13,396
They were gonna incinerate it.

1159
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,665
Might as well sell and make a dollar
out of it, you know?

1160
01:26:15,773 --> 01:26:17,468
For you or the cookie jar?

1161
01:26:23,014 --> 01:26:26,279
You're not that smart, Santos.
Who was in?

1162
01:26:26,651 --> 01:26:27,948
Silky? Clady?

1163
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,657
Wander.

1164
01:26:39,263 --> 01:26:40,560
Wander.

1165
01:26:45,737 --> 01:26:48,035
It's a Wander caper all the way.

1166
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:50,971
He's the only one
who could pull those strings.

1167
01:26:51,075 --> 01:26:53,270
He should have pulled your string
years ago.

1168
01:26:53,378 --> 01:26:55,710
We couldn't figure out why the fuck
he kept you around all this time.

1169
01:26:55,813 --> 01:26:57,576
Man, he's Jack's little pet.

1170
01:26:57,682 --> 01:27:00,116
Been doing the man's dirty missions
for years.

1171
01:27:00,218 --> 01:27:02,686
Washington wasn't giving me up to Biggs.

1172
01:27:05,156 --> 01:27:09,286
He was giving up the big dog.
He was giving up the king.

1173
01:27:09,394 --> 01:27:13,160
Wander played your fool ass, puto.
We all have.

1174
01:27:13,264 --> 01:27:15,061
You're a fucking chump, bro.

1175
01:27:22,006 --> 01:27:24,531
Washington's killers, they really cops?

1176
01:27:24,642 --> 01:27:25,666
Yeah, they were.

1177
01:27:25,777 --> 01:27:28,405
Couple of deputies from the ghetto
having the time of their lives.

1178
01:27:28,513 --> 01:27:29,537
And making us a lot of money.

1179
01:27:29,647 --> 01:27:31,979
-They were supposed to punch your ticket.
-But you punched theirs.

1180
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:34,051
Yeah. Now we gotta punch yours.

1181
01:27:34,485 --> 01:27:37,386
-Up in the hills.
-Up in the hills, brother.

1182
01:27:37,488 --> 01:27:39,683
First, we bag your hair, saliva and blood.

1183
01:27:39,791 --> 01:27:41,986
When they find
Linda Washington's corpse,

1184
01:27:42,093 --> 01:27:44,084
guess whose DNA's gonna be all over it?

1185
01:27:44,195 --> 01:27:46,629
And what is it gonna look like?

1186
01:27:46,731 --> 01:27:49,928
Like you finally snapped,
just like everyone knew you would.

1187
01:27:50,034 --> 01:27:51,695
That little nurse of yours, Lud?

1188
01:27:51,803 --> 01:27:54,101
You know, I'm popping
a hundred milli Viagra

1189
01:27:54,205 --> 01:27:56,639
and I'm gonna work that little brown ass.

1190
01:27:57,542 --> 01:27:59,442
Then I'm gonna break her neck.

1191
01:28:06,484 --> 01:28:09,942
Get that fucking cuff out of my mouth,
motherfucker! You...

1192
01:28:11,889 --> 01:28:13,982
Get that piece of shit!

1193
01:28:14,792 --> 01:28:19,752
Fuck you, motherfucker!
You little motherfucker!

1194
01:28:22,834 --> 01:28:24,859
Shoot that motherfucker!

1195
01:28:28,306 --> 01:28:29,295
Motherfucker!

1196
01:28:42,345 --> 01:28:44,313
Well, hello there, handsome.

1197
01:28:45,081 --> 01:28:46,844
Did you have a nice nap?

1198
01:29:12,041 --> 01:29:14,373
Santos! Your girlfriend's getting away!

1199
01:29:19,449 --> 01:29:20,916
What are you doing, Lud?

1200
01:29:21,017 --> 01:29:23,349
You crawling to your own grave?

1201
01:29:23,453 --> 01:29:24,681
Watch me play with this fool.

1202
01:29:37,033 --> 01:29:38,295
Oh!

1203
01:29:43,272 --> 01:29:44,398
Legger!

1204
01:29:44,607 --> 01:29:45,574
Yeah!

1205
01:29:48,444 --> 01:29:50,674
Who's the boy now, motherfucker? Huh?

1206
01:29:51,714 --> 01:29:53,238
Homeboy's gonna bury himself.

1207
01:29:53,349 --> 01:29:55,783
Just do the fucking puto and let's go.

1208
01:30:07,396 --> 01:30:08,829
So this is it, Lud.

1209
01:30:11,501 --> 01:30:14,493
-This is how it ends.
-DeMille, what the fuck? Let's go, bro!

1210
01:30:14,604 --> 01:30:16,401
Shut up! I'm having fun!

1211
01:31:06,489 --> 01:31:09,720
Where? Where is the fucking disc?

1212
01:31:09,859 --> 01:31:10,917
Huh?

1213
01:31:13,262 --> 01:31:14,593
Where's the disc?

1214
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:32,072
Okay.

1215
01:31:40,256 --> 01:31:41,553
Come here.

1216
01:31:41,924 --> 01:31:45,758
You're a lot tougher than that
piece of shit husband you used to have.

1217
01:31:47,163 --> 01:31:49,222
You're getting ahead of yourself.

1218
01:31:51,534 --> 01:31:52,626
We're gonna be here all night.

1219
01:32:06,382 --> 01:32:09,351
You have to go, Linda.
Wherever it is, you gotta go.

1220
01:32:09,452 --> 01:32:10,441
Come on.

1221
01:32:10,553 --> 01:32:12,248
I'm already packed.

1222
01:32:13,456 --> 01:32:15,515
Take care of yourself, Detective.

1223
01:32:22,131 --> 01:32:24,031
Where are you gonna go, cop killer?

1224
01:32:42,818 --> 01:32:44,445
I let myself in.

1225
01:32:46,455 --> 01:32:47,649
Clearly.

1226
01:32:49,325 --> 01:32:51,816
You all right, Tom?
I was worried about you.

1227
01:32:53,195 --> 01:32:56,392
Apparently, I killed two deputies.
Diskant's dead.

1228
01:32:56,499 --> 01:32:59,866
Santos and DeMille dragged me off to die,
so I put them down.

1229
01:33:01,671 --> 01:33:02,797
Can you fix this, Jack?

1230
01:33:02,905 --> 01:33:04,873
Oh, I'm going to fix it. I'm going to fix it.

1231
01:33:04,974 --> 01:33:07,442
You know, I suspected
that Santos and DeMille

1232
01:33:07,543 --> 01:33:09,374
were capering with Washington,

1233
01:33:09,478 --> 01:33:11,878
but I didn't want to believe
this kind of shit was going on in my unit.

1234
01:33:11,981 --> 01:33:13,448
Yeah. Me neither.

1235
01:33:14,116 --> 01:33:16,676
Boss, you better get Clady up here.
I need you guys.

1236
01:33:16,786 --> 01:33:18,481
I'll get him in the loop.

1237
01:33:19,021 --> 01:33:21,819
I'm gonna get him up here right now.
You need an alibi.

1238
01:33:22,258 --> 01:33:26,558
You were sleeping
on the couch after the party.

1239
01:33:27,630 --> 01:33:29,393
Santos and DeMille,
they killed those deputies.

1240
01:33:29,498 --> 01:33:30,965
Not you. Not you.

1241
01:33:45,548 --> 01:33:47,482
This is Clady's phone.

1242
01:33:48,384 --> 01:33:50,011
And his badge.

1243
01:33:51,087 --> 01:33:53,647
All this is you. It's you, Jack.

1244
01:33:53,756 --> 01:33:55,883
It's you. It's you, Tom.

1245
01:33:55,991 --> 01:33:58,186
Own it! Fucking own it!

1246
01:33:58,761 --> 01:33:59,955
You knew they were cops!

1247
01:34:00,062 --> 01:34:01,427
Those guys were so deep undercover

1248
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:03,521
that they... They lost their fucking minds!

1249
01:34:03,632 --> 01:34:04,963
Don't mourn them. You can't mourn them.

1250
01:34:05,067 --> 01:34:08,332
You set me up!
You sent me in to die, Jack!

1251
01:34:08,437 --> 01:34:11,201
I didn't set you up! You set yourself up!

1252
01:34:11,307 --> 01:34:14,538
I was trying to save you!
You backed me up in a fucking corner!

1253
01:34:14,643 --> 01:34:17,111
-You killed Washington!
-Fuck him!

1254
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:21,041
Fuck Santos! Fuck DeMille!
Fuck Clady! Fuck them all!

1255
01:34:21,584 --> 01:34:23,108
Fuck them all!

1256
01:34:23,352 --> 01:34:25,149
They're a dime a dozen.

1257
01:34:25,588 --> 01:34:26,714
You...

1258
01:34:27,389 --> 01:34:28,686
You, man.

1259
01:34:29,425 --> 01:34:30,722
You're special.

1260
01:34:31,527 --> 01:34:32,892
You're special to me.

1261
01:34:32,995 --> 01:34:34,292
And Diskant?

1262
01:34:35,097 --> 01:34:36,564
He special?

1263
01:34:37,233 --> 01:34:39,565
I watched a good man die because of you.

1264
01:34:40,035 --> 01:34:42,333
That is entirely

1265
01:34:43,172 --> 01:34:44,469
your fault.

1266
01:34:45,174 --> 01:34:46,436
Come on, Tom.

1267
01:34:47,009 --> 01:34:48,977
How do we get past this?

1268
01:34:51,914 --> 01:34:54,678
We got a destiny. You and me.

1269
01:34:56,886 --> 01:34:59,184
Nobody's getting past this, Jack.

1270
01:34:59,688 --> 01:35:02,885
Everything ends now. You end now.

1271
01:35:56,312 --> 01:35:58,177
I surrender! I surrender.

1272
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:01,044
Hook me and book me!

1273
01:36:03,485 --> 01:36:05,680
There's a rover right there!

1274
01:36:06,789 --> 01:36:09,587
Put it out! One for transport!

1275
01:36:09,692 --> 01:36:13,651
Goddamn!
Tom Ludlow, he got his man now!

1276
01:36:19,268 --> 01:36:20,895
I found you.

1277
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:24,138
I made you possible.

1278
01:36:26,942 --> 01:36:29,570
Now you need me more than ever, Tom.

1279
01:36:31,247 --> 01:36:34,114
What did you think I'd do
when I found out?

1280
01:36:37,086 --> 01:36:39,953
Wait, man. Wait.

1281
01:36:41,423 --> 01:36:42,788
Wait.

1282
01:36:48,364 --> 01:36:49,661
My wall.

1283
01:36:52,101 --> 01:36:54,569
It's all there. In the wall.

1284
01:36:55,804 --> 01:36:57,999
These secrets, they're killing us.

1285
01:37:05,848 --> 01:37:08,282
That's it. Open it up.

1286
01:37:11,487 --> 01:37:13,853
Open it up! Tear it down!

1287
01:37:27,636 --> 01:37:28,830
Tear it down!

1288
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:36,507
That's it.

1289
01:37:40,749 --> 01:37:42,011
There it is.

1290
01:37:50,793 --> 01:37:51,851
This

1291
01:37:52,461 --> 01:37:54,088
is my power.

1292
01:37:55,464 --> 01:37:58,228
This is my crown.

1293
01:37:59,768 --> 01:38:01,633
I'm the king of secrets, Tom!

1294
01:38:02,938 --> 01:38:05,133
I know which city councilman
is doing lines.

1295
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,868
I know who likes boys.
I know who's selling contracts.

1296
01:38:07,977 --> 01:38:10,070
I know who... Who's beating his wife.

1297
01:38:10,179 --> 01:38:14,275
I own them!
Even the Chief is in my pocket, Tom.

1298
01:38:15,484 --> 01:38:20,012
How do you think that I've been able to
protect you all these years?

1299
01:38:20,856 --> 01:38:23,324
What do you think it is that you're doing?

1300
01:38:23,926 --> 01:38:25,553
All these missions,

1301
01:38:27,696 --> 01:38:29,865
how do you think that you're able to touch
the untouchables?

1302
01:38:29,865 --> 01:38:31,560
how do you think that you're able to touch
the untouchables?

1303
01:38:32,534 --> 01:38:34,229
I'm gonna be chief!

1304
01:38:35,204 --> 01:38:37,001
I will be chief!

1305
01:38:37,306 --> 01:38:38,933
I will be mayor!

1306
01:38:40,242 --> 01:38:42,233
This is our world, Tom!

1307
01:38:43,212 --> 01:38:44,577
So, let's take it!

1308
01:38:45,547 --> 01:38:47,572
That why you put a hit on Washington?

1309
01:38:47,683 --> 01:38:49,674
Why you tried to kill me?

1310
01:38:50,152 --> 01:38:52,586
So you can keep stuffing money
in your wall?

1311
01:38:52,688 --> 01:38:54,485
But this is our money.

1312
01:38:56,258 --> 01:38:57,555
The unit's.

1313
01:38:58,994 --> 01:39:03,124
Who do you think paid for Silky's defense
during all those lawsuits?

1314
01:39:05,601 --> 01:39:07,762
Who's gonna pay for your retirement?

1315
01:39:08,937 --> 01:39:11,531
I'm just correcting a flaw
in the system, Tom.

1316
01:39:12,241 --> 01:39:16,200
This is about cops helping cops.

1317
01:39:17,446 --> 01:39:22,042
And if a teacher or a fireman could do it,

1318
01:39:22,885 --> 01:39:24,512
they would do it, too.

1319
01:39:27,589 --> 01:39:30,387
What happened to just locking up
bad people?

1320
01:39:33,462 --> 01:39:35,760
We're all bad, Tom.

1321
01:39:55,117 --> 01:39:57,244
You were my best friend.

1322
01:40:03,092 --> 01:40:04,719
We were family.

1323
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:39,618
Drop it, Ludlow!

1324
01:40:50,672 --> 01:40:52,469
There's been enough killing.

1325
01:40:57,479 --> 01:40:59,344
I came as soon as you called.

1326
01:41:00,349 --> 01:41:02,442
Guess you're first on scene.

1327
01:41:06,121 --> 01:41:08,248
Nope. You are.

1328
01:41:15,964 --> 01:41:20,560
Looks like Jack's friends got greedy
and came after the money.

1329
01:41:22,371 --> 01:41:24,532
-Is that what it looks like?
-Mmm-hmm.

1330
01:41:27,609 --> 01:41:29,577
This is your plan, Captain?

1331
01:41:30,312 --> 01:41:32,906
Just sit back and let us all kill each other?

1332
01:41:33,782 --> 01:41:35,374
You were the plan.

1333
01:41:38,153 --> 01:41:39,950
No one else could touch him.

1334
01:41:40,856 --> 01:41:44,622
Once your eyes were opened,
there was no other outcome.

1335
01:41:49,898 --> 01:41:51,729
Decisions were made, Tom,

1336
01:41:52,334 --> 01:41:55,132
-by powerful men with powerful secrets.
-Captain.

1337
01:41:57,039 --> 01:41:59,007
They were afraid of Jack.

1338
01:41:59,174 --> 01:42:00,732
They asked me to help.

1339
01:42:03,111 --> 01:42:07,946
One day, you will pass the Chief in the hall
and he will give you a nod.

1340
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:10,681
And you will know why.

1341
01:42:13,989 --> 01:42:15,786
Because you were right, Tom.

1342
01:42:17,259 --> 01:42:19,007
We do
need you.
