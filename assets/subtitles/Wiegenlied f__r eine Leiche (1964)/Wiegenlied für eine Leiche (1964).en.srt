1
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,908
<i>This house, this plantation...</i>

2
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,011
<i>this whole damned parish</i>
<i>belonged to my family...</i>

3
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:26,047
<i>before your people stepped aboard</i>
<i>the stinkin'cattle boat...</i>

4
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,094
<i>that brought 'em to this country.</i>

5
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,527
<i>Don't you dare</i>
<i>talk back to me, boy.!</i>

6
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,758
<i>My family's seen this state...</i>

7
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,130
<i>crawlin'with</i>
<i>lousy carpetbaggers...</i>

8
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,965
<i>that knew more about</i>
<i>behaving like a gentleman than you do.</i>

9
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,030
<i>I can't even look at Charlotte...</i>

10
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:44,838
<i>without ugly thoughts</i>
<i>rip my guts.</i>

11
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:50,406
<i>I'd sooner it'd been</i>
<i>one of my field boys.</i>

12
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,644
I could've killed him.

13
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:59,584
Do you know what it's costin' me
not to kill you?

14
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:08,431
My daughter and
Jewel Mayhew's husband.

15
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:14,030
You gutless, soft,
sucklin' swine!

16
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,982
My daddy sat out there
on that veranda.

17
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:32,021
Let this whole place
slide to dust.

18
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,791
When he died, there was nothin'
but debts and dirt.

19
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:43,801
I touched that dirt
and made it blossom.

20
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:48,102
I fought to keep this house
and to bring it back up.

21
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,941
<i>I don't have a son to give it to.</i>

22
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:56,004
Only Charlotte...

23
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,081
and she ain't gonna
give it to you.

24
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:06,990
You ain't gonna have
my home or my child.

25
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,860
I created both,
and I'm gonna keep 'em.

26
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,663
I ain't watched
over my girl all these years...

27
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,794
to have some...

28
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,805
to have someone...

29
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,570
to have some creature
like you take her away.

30
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,838
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you somethin'.

31
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,846
Your daughter ain't
a little girl anymore...

32
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:30,815
and there's gonna be
other men in her life besides you.

33
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,290
That's not funny.

34
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,040
Tell me somethin', boy.

35
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,980
How did you have
this elopement planned out?

36
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,109
How were you fixin'
to go about it?

37
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,053
Tomorrow night
during the dance...

38
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,319
Charlotte and I planned to meet
out in the summerhouse.

39
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,326
<i>She was gonna have</i>
<i>her bags packed...</i>

40
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:17,955
and we were gonna
go away together, that's all.

41
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,125
And I had got us a room in Baton Rouge.
We're gonna stay there.

42
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,635
I don't wanna hear about that.

43
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,900
Well, you asked me,
so I just told you, that's all.

44
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,966
Now...

45
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,441
you shut your filthy mouth...

46
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,679
and you listen to me.

47
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,084
Charlotte doesn't know
about this.

48
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,022
She doesn't know
you're here now.

49
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,822
She doesn't even know
Jewel was here last night.

50
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,661
How do you mean,
Jewel was here last night?

51
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,963
You mean to tell me that my wife
come over here to talk to you?

52
00:03:56,035 --> 00:04:00,335
As I recollect, she was sittin'
right about here.

53
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,857
Now...

54
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:24,486
you're gonna come to that dance
tomorrow night with your wife.

55
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,431
<i>You're gonna meet Charlotte</i>
<i>in the summerhouse...</i>

56
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,731
<i>just like you planned...</i>

57
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,636
<i>but what you're gonna</i>
<i>whisper in her ear...</i>

58
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,303
<i>it's gonna be</i>
<i>somethin'else again.</i>

59
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,854
<i> Come on, baby.</i>
<i>We haven't even danced once.</i>

60
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,298
Champagne wouldn't
be half the fun without prohibition.

61
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,843
Sure would like to meet
Sam's bootlegger.

62
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:18,645
Sam Hollis sure knows
how to give a party.

63
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,050
I just love to Charleston.

64
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,425
Ginny Mae? Ginny Mae,
you seen Charlotte anyplace?

65
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,395
I got some killing news to tell her.

66
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,398
I haven't seen her
for a long time now.

67
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,560
The last time I saw her,
she was dancin' with John Mayhew.

68
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:40,902
Yeah, and it looks like it's gonna be
quite a spell before you see <i>her</i> again.

69
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,237
I just gotta find...

70
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,609
I made a mistake, Charlotte,
that's all.

71
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,875
Don't cry.

72
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:37,528
Look, l-I know
it's no consolation to you...

73
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,656
but I really loved you
at one time.

74
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,205
Try and understand that.
I really loved you.

75
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,645
I could <i>kill</i> you!

76
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:34,112
James! You ought to know you can't open
them cases with a thing like that.

77
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,645
Look here. Why do you think
I brought this special?

78
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,310
- <i>Good evening, Mr. And Mrs. Howard.</i>
- Oh, Geraldine.

79
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,143
Hasn't this been
just the loveliest evening?

80
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,947
We have to go now.
Be a dear and thank Mr. Hollis for us.

81
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,546
- I just can't find him anywhere.
- I'll do that little old thing, Mr. Howard.

82
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,557
Thank you, dear.
Good night, ladies.

83
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,616
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. And Mrs. Howard.

84
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:01,898
-
- Charlotte?

85
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:27,365
Charlotte...
Aah!

86
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,594
No!

87
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,297
No!

88
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,601
No!

89
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,507
Oh, my God!

90
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,712
<i>Come on. Once more.</i>

91
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:50,879
Okay. Now, one more time!

92
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,643
<i>Oh, there's Charlotte.</i>

93
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,022
<i>Somebody ought to call a doctor.</i>

94
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,731
Charlotte, honey...

95
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,209
you come with me now.

96
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,268
No, Papa.

97
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,744
No, Papa.
L- I don't want to, Papa.

98
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,513
No, Papa.

99
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:33,354
- I don't want to, Papa.
- Come with me, baby.

100
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,417
No, Papa.

101
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,003
<i>Boy, it sure is spooky around here.</i>

102
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:52,135
<i> Especially the graveyard.</i>
<i>Gets spookier. You'll see.</i>

103
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,044
- Hurry up. It's gettin' late.
- You think there really is a ghost?

104
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,515
- <i>Who knows?</i>
- <i>Sure, there's a ghost. There's the house now.</i>

105
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,815
Gives me the creeps
every time I see it.

106
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,524
- What if she catches me?
- Shh!

107
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,527
Then you tell her you'reJewel Mayhew
from down the road...

108
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,928
and you come a-lookin'
for your poor, little old husband's head.

109
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,025
What if she catches me?

110
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:21,130
Now, look, you wanna join
the Spiders, don't you?

111
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,300
Well, get on in there.

112
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,935
Don't forget to get somethin'
she touched with her own hands.

113
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:30,846
Watch out for that cleaver, now.
She's just liable to chop off your little head.

114
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,044
Now, go on!
We haven't got all night.

115
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,422
Go on! Go on!

116
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,861
John?

117
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:39,136
- Get out of here!
- Hurry! She'll catch us!

118
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,609
- <i>She ain't catchin'me.!</i>
- <i>Come on.! Move.!</i>

119
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:47,079
- I'm scared!
- <i>I'm runnin', I'm runnin',</i>

120
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,313
<i>Chop, chop</i>
<i>sweet Charlotte</i>

121
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:54,084
<i>Chop, chop</i>
<i>till he's dead</i>

122
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:56,921
<i>Chop, chop</i>
<i>sweet Charlotte</i>

123
00:14:56,993 --> 00:15:01,225
<i>Chop off</i>
<i>his hand and head</i>

124
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:06,535
<i>To meet your lover</i>
<i>you ran, chop, chop</i>

125
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:09,800
<i>Now everyone understands</i>

126
00:15:09,873 --> 00:15:13,536
<i>Just why you ran to meet your love</i>
<i>chop, chop</i>

127
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,273
<i>To chop off</i>
<i>his head and hand</i>

128
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:20,578
<i>Chop, chop</i>
<i>sweet Charlotte</i>

129
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:25,713
<i>Chop, chop</i>
<i>till he's dead</i>

130
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:23,463
Damn you!

131
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:35,207
Damn you!

132
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:39,381
Get off my property,
or I'll shoot!

133
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:45,021
<i>I told you</i>
<i>to get off my property.!</i>

134
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:47,996
Stan, look out!
Look out up there! Stan!

135
00:17:58,174 --> 00:18:02,372
- Man, oh, man!
- That crazy woman. I'm tellin' you.

136
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:04,743
I wouldn't go out there
if I was you.

137
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:08,545
Now, what do you think you're doin',
firing on my man like that?

138
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:11,348
That's my land
he's plowin' up down there.

139
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:15,380
<i>Damn it.!</i>
<i>Ma'am, you could have killed him.</i>

140
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,926
If I'd been aimin' to kill him,
I would have.

141
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:22,021
Now, see here, Miss Hollis. We done
everything we could to accommodate you.

142
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:24,032
But this time,
you've gone too far.

143
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,830
Now, we got a bridge to build
and roads to lay...

144
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:28,894
and we ain't got no more time
to fool with ya.

145
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,806
Where you are,
I could spit in your eye...

146
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:36,004
with no strain at all.

147
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,912
Now, Miss Hollis,
I ain't in no mood for jokes.

148
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:41,780
I'm goin' straight into town
and see the sheriff.

149
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,785
I don't care where
you go straight to...

150
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:47,186
just so long as you go
and take <i>that</i> and them with you.

151
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:50,658
Now, Miss Hollis, you know as well
as I do the State of Louisiana...

152
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:55,187
requisitioned this whole area, includin'
your house, more than six months ago.

153
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:57,961
Just because some old fool in Baton Rouge
signed a little bitty piece of paper...

154
00:18:58,034 --> 00:18:59,968
doesn't make it so.

155
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:02,266
Nobody ever asked me
to sign anything...

156
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:05,069
and nobody's gonna
tear down my house...

157
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:07,632
to build a piddlin' bridge
or anything else.

158
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,271
So you just clear off
my property once and for all!

159
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:12,713
I don't know.
Some folks seem to think...

160
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:16,240
they got a natural-born right
to get away with murder.

161
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:20,552
Hey, look out!

162
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:36,029
<i>You sure had yourself a good time today,</i>
<i>didn't you, missy?</i>

163
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:39,564
You just cool down now.

164
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,046
What are you gonna do, boss?

165
00:19:46,116 --> 00:19:49,085
I'm goin' into town, and you keep
those boys out of sight till I get back.

166
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:51,484
- Okay, boss.
- I'll bring that sheriff back out here...

167
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:54,079
in a half hour
if I have to drag him out.

168
00:19:56,393 --> 00:20:00,727
Ah. You fixed things up for fair.

169
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:03,095
Come on. Come on.

170
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,431
But they're gonna dig up the graves.
Papa's grave.

171
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:08,437
They wasn't within
100 feet of them graves.

172
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:11,201
Anyhow, they're fixin'
to tear down the whole house.

173
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:14,607
I don't see what difference
plowin' up the grounds is gonna make.

174
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:18,204
Come on.
Come on, now.

175
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:21,978
They offered to move your pappy's remains.
You should've let 'em.

176
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:25,215
They can't do him any harm now.

177
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:30,521
Now, go on in there
and get yourself quieted down.

178
00:20:30,593 --> 00:20:33,494
<i>You've done enough</i>
<i>for one day.</i>

179
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,358
<i>Let me tell you somethin',</i>

180
00:20:39,436 --> 00:20:43,964
<i>Ain't gonna be but a half an hour</i>
<i>before that sheriff comes over here.</i>

181
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,999
So you get yourself
dressed up real pretty...

182
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:51,206
and you come on downstairs
and get your breakfast.

183
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:55,513
If Luke Standish ever comes out here,
he'll be real sorry.

184
00:20:55,585 --> 00:21:00,522
You hush. That ain't no way
to talk, Miss Charlotte.

185
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,526
Now, you come on.
Get yourself dressed.

186
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:09,258
Velma'll go downstairs
and fix you a nice breakfast.

187
00:21:09,332 --> 00:21:13,632
Don't you worry about that sheriff
when he comes out here.

188
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:16,069
Velma'll get rid of him.

189
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:18,699
Yes, sir.

190
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:21,039
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

191
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,833
It's not very often
we have a homicide...

192
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:51,033
and never able to find
the victim's head and hand.

193
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:55,635
I'm not much concerned about
examining your credentials, Mr. Wills.

194
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:58,943
I'm happy to go along
with anything you say.

195
00:21:59,015 --> 00:22:02,849
I just have my doubts about
what you can expect to find.

196
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,946
We've had newsmen and all sorts
comin' down here for 35 years or more...

197
00:22:07,023 --> 00:22:08,957
and none of'em any the wiser.

198
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,687
I don't expect to unearth
anything extraordinary.

199
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:13,991
After all, there's
nothing really unusual...

200
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:16,429
about an unclaimed
insurance policy.

201
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:18,967
It's just that
I don't want to upset anybody.

202
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:21,060
So if you'll just go along
with my little masquerade...

203
00:22:21,137 --> 00:22:25,073
of a reporter from one
of our more esoteric crime magazines...

204
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:28,304
I'd be most awfully grateful to you.

205
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:32,109
Well, Mr. Wills, since you've come
all the way from London, England to see us...

206
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:34,514
I guess we'll just
have to oblige you...

207
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:38,281
esoteric magazines and all.

208
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:40,379
I'm sorry, Mr. Standish.

209
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:43,857
You're gonna to have to come out to the
Hollis place. We got real trouble this time.

210
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:48,827
What a remarkable coincidence.

211
00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:50,832
By the way, Sheriff...

212
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,767
I wonder if you could arrange
for me to meetJewel Mayhew?

213
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:56,168
<i>I guess we'll just</i>
<i>have to oblige you.</i>

214
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,230
Thank you very much.

215
00:23:15,258 --> 00:23:18,523
- Velma!
- What?

216
00:23:18,595 --> 00:23:22,725
<i>The sheriffs comin',</i>
<i>Get rid ofhim. Hear?</i>

217
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,131
Oh.

218
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:29,769
She's not really crazy.
She just acts that way...

219
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,069
because people seem
to expect it of her.

220
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:34,075
You can wait in the car.

221
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,047
She ain't a-gonna come down.

222
00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:44,753
You can't see her. She's sick.

223
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:46,982
All that dust and all that racket
from your machines...

224
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,616
has made her <i>real</i> sick.

225
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:53,458
She's waiting for Dr. Drew
to come and tend to her right now.

226
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:57,989
That's too bad, 'cause there's
a little matter of an unlicensed gun.

227
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:00,661
- I was hopin' Miss Hollis
maybe could help me find it.
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:04,605
Well, I reckon I'll just
have to look for it myself, Miss Cruther.

229
00:24:04,674 --> 00:24:07,074
<i>Mornin', Miss Charlotte.</i>

230
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:09,543
Get out, Luke Standish!

231
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:12,103
You smirkin'Judas...

232
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:14,172
comin' around here
with your lyin' tricks!

233
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,184
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

234
00:24:16,252 --> 00:24:18,618
Papa gave you the first job
you ever had in this town.

235
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,021
- Without him, you wouldn't
be Sheriff or anything else.
- I know that, Miss Charlotte.

236
00:24:22,091 --> 00:24:24,184
- That's why I'm trying to help you.
- Help me?

237
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,696
You had orders
to leave this house long ago.

238
00:24:27,764 --> 00:24:31,222
If I'd been doin' my job,
you'd have been long gone by now.

239
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:34,361
If you are so anxious to help me...

240
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:36,371
why don't you leave me alone?

241
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:41,843
And tell everybody to stop threatenin' me
with cuttin' off my water and electricity.

242
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:43,845
I can't, Miss Charlotte.

243
00:24:43,913 --> 00:24:46,108
What you did today
puts it right out of my hands.

244
00:24:46,182 --> 00:24:49,174
Threatenin' people's one thing,
but shootin' at 'em's another.

245
00:24:49,252 --> 00:24:53,211
I got orders now to see
that you're gone within 10 days.

246
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:55,223
They can hold up on the blastin'
they've gotta do...

247
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,852
and keep the men and equipment workin' on the
approach road on the other side of the river.

248
00:24:58,928 --> 00:25:01,362
But if you aren't out of here
by the end of next week...

249
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:04,127
the county commissioner is gonna
have you up for criminal action.

250
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,796
But this is my home.
I haven't any other place to go.

251
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:12,432
- They can build their damn bridge anywhere.
- No, ma'am.

252
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:16,808
They have to build it to meet up
with the road on the other side of the river.

253
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:18,813
There isn't any alternative.

254
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:23,545
End of next week,
this house is comin' down.

255
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:25,917
When my cousin Miriam comes...

256
00:25:25,988 --> 00:25:27,922
she'll know how to deal
with the county commissioner.

257
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,552
- I didn't know you were expectin' her.
- Well, I am.

258
00:25:32,628 --> 00:25:35,927
Afraid she won't make a bit of difference
as far as the bridge is concerned.

259
00:25:35,998 --> 00:25:38,626
We'll wait and see.

260
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:42,068
I reckon we will. I ain't gonna take
that gun away from you, Miss Charlotte.

261
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:44,971
I certainly hope you aren't
plannin' on using it again.

262
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,601
Comin' in here to fetch you out
is the last thing I wanna do.

263
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:50,703
Then don't come!

264
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:16,999
What'd you wanna go tellin' him stories
about Miss Miriam for?

265
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:19,166
She ain't even answered your letters.

266
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:22,575
Well, she's comin' anyway.

267
00:26:22,645 --> 00:26:27,275
<i>Be the saddest day of your life, missy,</i>
<i>if she does come.</i>

268
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,616
Your cousin Miriam ain't never had
but one idea in her head...

269
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:33,917
and that was
lookin' out for herself.

270
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:37,385
She's gotta come.

271
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,293
She's the only kin I got left.

272
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:52,764
Miriam's just gotta come.

273
00:26:52,842 --> 00:26:55,640
She's the only one
who can help me now.

274
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:58,839
<i>She's just gotta come.</i>

275
00:26:58,915 --> 00:27:01,440
<i> I guess there's been</i>
<i>a whole heap of changes...</i>

276
00:27:01,517 --> 00:27:05,385
- <i>in this part of the country</i>
<i>since you was here last, miss.</i>
- I imagine there have been.

277
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:08,424
'Course, things ain't changed much
in this parish...

278
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:11,016
exceptin' folks are gettin'
a lot older than they used to be.

279
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:13,027
I suppose they are.

280
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:21,437
There's absolutely no point
you're gettin' so upset...

281
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:24,769
the way you did this morning.

282
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:28,038
Anyone who knew you
less well than I do <i>might</i> be forgiven...

283
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,807
for thinkin' you had
a persecution complex.

284
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:34,509
<i>Yes, Dr. Drew.</i>

285
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:36,518
Charlotte...

286
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:39,987
they are <i>asking</i> you
to leave this house...

287
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:44,015
because they are going
to tear it down...

288
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:47,119
not because of any
of the <i>ulterior</i> motives...

289
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:49,687
- that you seem to imagine.
-

290
00:27:49,765 --> 00:27:51,926
- What's that?
- Oh, Charlotte, please.

291
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:57,303
- Don't get so jumpy about everything.
- It's Miriam!

292
00:27:57,373 --> 00:28:00,672
Miriam isn't expected
till tomorrow evenin'.

293
00:28:00,743 --> 00:28:03,007
Now, come on.
Calm down.

294
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:10,416
Well, ma'am, this is it.

295
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:12,784
They say that places
you knew as a child...

296
00:28:12,855 --> 00:28:15,949
always seem smaller
than your memory of them.

297
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:18,687
<i>It's not true.</i>

298
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:24,925
Huh.

299
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:45,053
Velma.

300
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:47,851
Velma Cruther.

301
00:28:47,924 --> 00:28:50,586
Shall I take these in, miss?

302
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,628
Thank you.
Just put them up there.

303
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,160
It's just as I left it.

304
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:09,338
- How much is that?
- <i>$2.50, ma'am.</i>

305
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:23,451
- Keep the change.
- <i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

306
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,235
You nearly beat your telegram here.

307
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:40,901
I know I'm a day early.
I hope it won't inconvenience anybody.

308
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:43,445
<i>Miriam.!</i>

309
00:29:43,512 --> 00:29:45,878
I just can't believe it.

310
00:29:45,948 --> 00:29:49,884
- <i>You look marvelous.</i>
- What is it that you can't believe, Drew?

311
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,546
<i>That I'm here,</i>
<i>or that I look the way I do?</i>

312
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:55,819
Come on. Don't make fun
of an old man.

313
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:59,327
You know I never was any good
at expressin' myself.

314
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:01,989
Oh, that's not so at all, Drew.

315
00:30:02,064 --> 00:30:05,158
You were always very quick
with your compliments.

316
00:30:08,571 --> 00:30:11,734
It was just your intentions...

317
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:17,710
that were sometimes a little vague.

318
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,549
You all want this stuff upstairs?

319
00:30:20,682 --> 00:30:23,913
I'll give you a hand
in just a minute.

320
00:30:23,985 --> 00:30:28,479
I suppose you wanna see Charlotte.

321
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:31,185
I think I already have.

322
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:36,219
- Won't she be coming down?
- I think we'd better go up. She's a bit upset.

323
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:38,789
- Well, there was a little trouble here this mornin'.
- Trouble?

324
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:41,028
Nothin' serious.

325
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:44,401
And, besides, you took us by surprise.
We weren't expectin' you till tomorrow.

326
00:30:44,472 --> 00:30:47,407
There was a mix-up.
I had to take an earlier plane.

327
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:49,636
What kind of trouble?

328
00:30:50,745 --> 00:30:54,408
Just plain, blind stubborn.

329
00:30:54,482 --> 00:30:58,748
With her money, she could live anywhere
in the world like a queen.

330
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,051
But as it is, I'm afraid you'll have more
than your hands full...

331
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:04,853
gettin' her out of this place.

332
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:10,727
The three of us used to slide
down this banister.

333
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,824
I was always the champion.

334
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:16,598
We just let you win
because you were the youngest.

335
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,799
An old house is difficult
to keep clean.

336
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:27,547
If you can get anybody out
from town to work in this place...

337
00:31:27,616 --> 00:31:29,550
you're doin' a lot better
than I can.

338
00:31:29,618 --> 00:31:32,644
Don't misunderstand me, Velma.

339
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:35,155
I know how exhausting
it must be...

340
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:37,885
having to do all the work
out here alone.

341
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:47,333
There's a lot more bags out there.

342
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:07,580
<i>Charlotte, it's Miriam.</i>

343
00:32:27,742 --> 00:32:30,506
How good it was getting your letter
asking me to come.

344
00:32:40,522 --> 00:32:45,357
Miriam! I knew you'd come!
I just knew you would.

345
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:48,828
- And you're gonna help me.
- Of course I'll do whatever I can.

346
00:32:48,897 --> 00:32:52,628
I've thought of you and the house.
It's like coming home.

347
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:56,102
Oh, but everything
is-is-is such a mess.

348
00:32:56,171 --> 00:33:00,505
You see, I wasn't expectin' you
until tomorrow.

349
00:33:00,575 --> 00:33:02,941
Don't worry. We're together again.
That's the important thing.

350
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:06,071
Yes. Of course it is.

351
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,944
Miss Charlotte's room.

352
00:33:14,856 --> 00:33:18,292
Remember the night you taught me
how to smoke my first cigarette, and you...

353
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:21,886
or was it I... set the drapes on fire?

354
00:33:23,598 --> 00:33:26,465
I was the one
they whopped, I know.

355
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:30,095
No! That's Velma's job!

356
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:33,834
Yes, but Velma's...
well, Velma.

357
00:33:40,815 --> 00:33:44,842
It's just that we haven't
seen each other in so long...

358
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:47,615
you'd think we'd have
other things to talk about.

359
00:33:47,689 --> 00:33:51,420
I mean, arguing about
who's gonna make up the bed.

360
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:08,505
If you all want me
to fix supper for you...

361
00:34:08,576 --> 00:34:11,545
you better eat early...

362
00:34:11,613 --> 00:34:13,547
because I gotta get home.

363
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:15,583
Well, thank you, Velma.

364
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:19,609
- Is that an invitation?
- No!

365
00:34:19,687 --> 00:34:23,714
I just reckon you'd be
sniffin' around here more than usual...

366
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:26,352
now that Miss Miriam's back.

367
00:34:26,427 --> 00:34:28,361
There's nothin' like a family reunion.

368
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:32,456
I think I'll just get
the key to the cellar.

369
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:38,464
Hmph! Just thinks he's gonna get
the key to the cellar.

370
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,998
Well, it's the only thing.

371
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:52,143
I didn't know Ida told you
where the keys to the cellar were.

372
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,211
Thank you, sir.

373
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,319
I can't remember when
I last dined in here.

374
00:34:59,394 --> 00:35:03,091
Papa used to say
this was his favorite room.

375
00:35:03,164 --> 00:35:05,325
I guess maybe that's 'cause
he loved to eat so much.

376
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,732
<i>You know, Miriam...</i>

377
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:10,066
when all this nonsense
about the house is straightened out...

378
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:12,902
we could give parties here again.

379
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:19,339
Why not? What's so
impossible about that?

380
00:35:19,414 --> 00:35:22,212
It would be lovely.

381
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:24,513
Yes, it would be nice.

382
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:28,352
Aren't you forgettin' about the limit
they put on vacatin' the house?

383
00:35:28,423 --> 00:35:32,120
You've got to be out of here a week from
Monday, and there's no two ways about it.

384
00:35:32,193 --> 00:35:34,127
Drew, you carry on
as if you're a member...

385
00:35:34,195 --> 00:35:36,857
of the Department
of Roads and Bridges, or somethin'.

386
00:35:36,931 --> 00:35:39,263
Miriam will tell them where to get off,
won't you, Cousin, darling?

387
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:41,268
I wish I could.

388
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:45,432
Charlotte, you have just
got to understand...

389
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:47,736
that there's nothin',
absolutely nothin'...

390
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:50,073
that Miriam or anybody else
can do about it.

391
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:54,376
Now, they are going to tear down
this house, and that is final.

392
00:35:54,449 --> 00:35:56,679
Oh, you're so stuffy.

393
00:35:56,751 --> 00:35:59,686
They took their smelly old equipment
out of here, didn't they?

394
00:35:59,754 --> 00:36:03,622
Miriam isn't frightened of
a bunch of crooked politicians.

395
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:05,625
You know, it wouldn't surprise me
to find out...

396
00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:08,218
<i>thatJewel Mayhew is behind all this.</i>

397
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:11,629
Charlotte, that is ridiculous!

398
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:15,260
Is it? You notice they're not laying
a finger on her land.

399
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:18,396
They're destroying <i>my</i> house,
but they're not touching <i>hers.</i>

400
00:36:18,473 --> 00:36:20,407
I've rented a car for you, Miriam.

401
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:23,842
- <i>You can go tomorrow.</i>
- Go where?

402
00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:27,473
To Baton Rouge to put that damn
county commissioner straight.

403
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:33,516
Charlotte...

404
00:36:33,588 --> 00:36:35,783
there's nothing I wouldn't do
for you if I could.

405
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:39,691
You know that.
But I'm afraid Drew's right.

406
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:43,595
There isn't anything
we can do about the house.

407
00:36:43,665 --> 00:36:45,599
You have to leave.

408
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:03,947
What do you think
I asked you here for?

409
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:06,714
Company?

410
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:08,779
I thought you were
gonna help me!

411
00:37:08,856 --> 00:37:13,122
But I shall. That's why I came...
to help, to be with you.

412
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:15,560
To be with me?

413
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,191
I've lived alone here
ever since Papa died.

414
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:22,703
The only people I've ever seen
are Velma and Drew...

415
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,331
who comes out when he feels like it
just to see if I'm still alive...

416
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:28,398
- <i>Charlotte, that's not true.</i>
- <i>and a bunch of sniggering idiots...</i>

417
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:30,637
<i>who come out here</i>
<i>to make fun of me.</i>

418
00:37:30,712 --> 00:37:33,772
Do you think
I'd ask you back here...

419
00:37:33,848 --> 00:37:35,839
just-just to be with me?

420
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:40,547
<i>Charlotte, she's only tryin'</i>
<i>to lend a helpin'hand.</i>

421
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:43,249
Oh, yes. I can see that.

422
00:37:43,324 --> 00:37:47,658
She's just breakin' her back.

423
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:51,460
God, do you have gratitude!

424
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:53,693
When you first came here
after your precious papa died...

425
00:37:53,768 --> 00:37:56,236
<i>you acted as if</i>
<i>we weren't good enough for you.</i>

426
00:37:56,304 --> 00:38:01,105
- And your mama, a sorry, up-north waitress...
- Charlotte, that's enough.

427
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:04,235
Let her talk, Drew, if insulting me
gives her any satisfaction.

428
00:38:04,312 --> 00:38:07,873
When you first came here, Papa took you
downtown, bought you a whole new wardrobe.

429
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:11,783
- Does it insult you to remember that?
- Yes, I remember.

430
00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:14,913
You took your poor, up-north cousin
downtown for a whole new wardrobe...

431
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:17,389
down to a sleazy store
he wouldn't even let you set foot in.

432
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:21,019
Oh, that wasn't good enough for you?
Papa didn't give you enough?

433
00:38:21,095 --> 00:38:23,120
Well, maybe that's what
you came back here for...

434
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:25,188
to get the rest of Papa's money.

435
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:29,464
Charlotte! I have a career,
and I've given up valuable time to come here.

436
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:33,098
I know. Now, let me see.
What-What is it you call your job?

437
00:38:33,174 --> 00:38:37,110
Oh, yes. Public relations.
Sounds like somethin' pretty dirty to me.

438
00:38:37,178 --> 00:38:40,079
The dirt, Charlotte,
is entirely in your own mind.

439
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:42,173
I wouldn't dwell on it
if I were you, Charlotte.

440
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,184
She didn't come here
to be insulted.

441
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:46,413
No, most likely she came back here
to helpJewel Mayhew...

442
00:38:46,487 --> 00:38:49,149
- drive me out of my own house.
- Charlotte, you don't believe that.

443
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:55,888
Why wouldn't Miriam conspire
with Jewel against me?

444
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:58,727
Who was it went
sneakin' off toJewel...

445
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,066
and told her about her husband
and me in the first place?

446
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:13,645
Didn't know about that,
did you, Drew?

447
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:22,088
That's somethin' you never told
your precious boyfriend, isn't that so, Miriam?

448
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:26,649
<i>Isn't it, Cousin, darling?</i>

449
00:39:32,934 --> 00:39:36,199
Yes, I told Jewel.
And I told your father too.

450
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,900
Why wouldn't I? After all,
I wasn't much more than a child then.

451
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:44,103
And all I ever got in this house
was people telling me how lucky I was...

452
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:48,012
and your father always favoring you
and holding you up as an example!

453
00:39:48,082 --> 00:39:51,950
<i>Why wouldn't I tell him</i>
<i>that his pure, darling little girl...</i>

454
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:56,217
was having a dirty little affair
with a married man?

455
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:00,685
You're a vile, sorry little bitch!

456
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:05,494
How was I to know it would end
in murder with John being butchered?

457
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:32,225
No, you couldn't have known that.

458
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:36,992
And you couldn't have known
that when Drew found out...

459
00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:40,033
he was so frightened of having
his fine old name linked with ours...

460
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:42,331
that he'd walk out on you.

461
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:47,107
But Drew's still here...

462
00:40:47,175 --> 00:40:50,975
and you're both still alive and...

463
00:40:52,813 --> 00:40:55,247
and I'm still here.

464
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,553
But, John...

465
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:06,057
John never even...

466
00:41:20,241 --> 00:41:23,642
John? John?

467
00:41:25,346 --> 00:41:28,338
John?

468
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:31,731
John.

469
00:41:31,766 --> 00:41:32,778
John.

470
00:41:37,158 --> 00:41:40,093
She is deranged, Drew.
She must be.

471
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:45,827
Well, no. She's certainly worse
than when I last wrote you...

472
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,428
but not to the extent
of being committed.

473
00:41:50,504 --> 00:41:54,941
I'm sorry. There's just no way
to avoid the problem.

474
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:57,204
There are times when...

475
00:41:57,278 --> 00:42:01,339
she genuinely doesn't know
what she's saying, but...

476
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:03,542
On the other hand,
I thought she described...

477
00:42:03,618 --> 00:42:06,985
the way you left me
rather accurately.

478
00:42:07,054 --> 00:42:09,921
If it's any comfort,
I've always regretted...

479
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:14,084
having let you go.

480
00:42:17,498 --> 00:42:20,592
We don't have time
for regrets now, Drew.

481
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,543
And there is a lot to regret.

482
00:42:34,548 --> 00:42:36,539
John?

483
00:42:43,724 --> 00:42:45,658
John?

484
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:51,694
What a shame.
With all that money...

485
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:55,463
she could have done
such wonderful things with this place...

486
00:42:55,536 --> 00:42:58,505
made it so beautiful again.

487
00:42:58,572 --> 00:43:01,632
How could she stand
being alone here all these years?

488
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:06,806
People who oblige to live alone have
a habit of creatin' company for themselves.

489
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:11,147
Innocent fancies
can become fixed delusions.

490
00:43:11,218 --> 00:43:15,154
I think she never fully accepted
John Mayhew's death.

491
00:43:15,222 --> 00:43:18,157
At least, part of her mind hasn't.

492
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:20,853
Sometimes, she speaks of him...

493
00:43:20,928 --> 00:43:25,160
as if he were still alive
here in this house...

494
00:43:25,232 --> 00:43:29,362
as if she could still
feel his personality.

495
00:43:29,437 --> 00:43:32,929
She plays that old harpsichord,
the song he wrote for her.

496
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:38,634
Often at night,
she sits up dressed...

497
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:41,307
as if she were still young...

498
00:43:41,382 --> 00:43:43,543
and expectin' a beau.

499
00:43:45,052 --> 00:43:49,386
I seem to remember expecting
something like that once myself.

500
00:44:01,135 --> 00:44:04,400
You going to be all right here?
I could stay over.

501
00:44:04,472 --> 00:44:07,464
You've been content to let me get along
on my own all these years.

502
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,771
I don't think another night
is gonna kill me.

503
00:44:09,844 --> 00:44:12,312
I guess you're right.

504
00:44:14,882 --> 00:44:17,316
Oh, uh...

505
00:44:17,385 --> 00:44:19,444
maybe you'd better have this.

506
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,454
- What on earth for?
- Well, you never know.

507
00:44:21,522 --> 00:44:24,889
You do have people
skulkin' around here occasionally.

508
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:29,055
- Anyway, you'd better take it.
- Thank you.

509
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:31,189
Good night.

510
00:44:31,265 --> 00:44:33,256
Good night.

511
00:44:34,735 --> 00:44:36,726
Good night.

512
00:47:04,851 --> 00:47:07,547
My dress.

513
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,952
Somebody slashed my dress.

514
00:47:37,517 --> 00:47:39,678
They certainly were
attractive youngsters.

515
00:47:39,752 --> 00:47:43,688
<i>Yes, sir. That was just about the biggest story</i>
<i>that ever broke in this town.</i>

516
00:47:43,756 --> 00:47:47,419
<i>Yes, I can see you gave it what you might call</i>
<i>"the full treatment."</i>

517
00:47:47,493 --> 00:47:50,860
Well, we couldn't very well bury it
on the society page, could we?

518
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:54,730
Anyhow, help yourself. I think
you'll find everything that you need here.

519
00:47:54,801 --> 00:47:57,463
And that's a pretty good picture
of Miss Charlotte.

520
00:47:57,537 --> 00:48:00,529
Yes, it is.

521
00:48:00,607 --> 00:48:03,599
<i>I was working for the press</i>
<i>when she arrived in London.</i>

522
00:48:03,676 --> 00:48:07,772
Not one of us succeeded
in getting an interview with her.

523
00:48:07,847 --> 00:48:09,974
Well, they said that
Big Sam sent her over there...

524
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:12,108
to prevent her from being
charged and tried.

525
00:48:12,185 --> 00:48:14,119
But that wasn't so.

526
00:48:14,187 --> 00:48:16,052
Sending her out of the country
wouldn't have helped.

527
00:48:16,122 --> 00:48:20,616
I reckon Sam's political connections
had more to do with it.

528
00:48:20,693 --> 00:48:24,220
As I remember, the district attorney
tried hard to make the charge stick...

529
00:48:24,297 --> 00:48:27,460
but the whole thing was transferred
over to Baton Rouge.

530
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:32,163
I reckon Sam's friends in the capitol got busy,
because nothin' ever did come of it.

531
00:48:32,238 --> 00:48:35,571
Lack of evidence
was the official explanation.

532
00:48:35,642 --> 00:48:37,633
You wouldn't think so
from the headlines.

533
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,373
Hi, Mr. Blake.
Thanks for the use of the hall.

534
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:45,383
Tell me, are you running anything
on the return of Miriam Deering?

535
00:48:45,451 --> 00:48:47,681
Just an insert
in the social column.

536
00:48:47,754 --> 00:48:50,086
The social column. You gotta be kiddin'.

537
00:48:50,156 --> 00:48:53,922
Excuse me, Mr. Wills. This is a colleague
of yours, Mr. Marchand from New York.

538
00:48:53,993 --> 00:48:56,791
- How do you do?
- And who are you covering the story for?

539
00:48:56,863 --> 00:49:01,664
Don't worry about me, old chap.
My status is that of an amateur.

540
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:03,861
By the way,
what journal do you represent?

541
00:49:03,936 --> 00:49:05,961
<i>Crimes of Passion</i>
and <i>Century Crime Classics.</i>

542
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:08,974
You know, that Hollis dame hit the news
again over that business with the bridge.

543
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:11,772
We did a special issue on her.
Here, take a look.

544
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:17,878
<i>No head, no hand.</i>
<i>Just like the way it was.</i>

545
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:20,885
Yes.

546
00:49:20,953 --> 00:49:25,822
- Very colorful.
- Yeah, we're really going to town on this one.

547
00:49:25,892 --> 00:49:28,417
Hey, Mr. Blake.

548
00:49:28,494 --> 00:49:30,985
<i>You never showed me this stuff.</i>

549
00:49:31,064 --> 00:49:34,693
<i>Well, one thing they didn't do then was</i>
<i>to play up the sex angle like you can today.</i>

550
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:50,773
Miriam Deering.

551
00:49:58,057 --> 00:50:00,218
Miss Deering!

552
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:03,421
My, it's good to see you back.

553
00:50:03,496 --> 00:50:08,160
- Jewel! Jewel Mayhew!
- Joseph.

554
00:50:08,234 --> 00:50:10,964
- Oh, here. Let me help you.
- You leave me be.

555
00:50:11,037 --> 00:50:13,665
If I ever prayed for anything...

556
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,641
it was that you would never
dare show your face to me again.

557
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:19,143
After all these years,
what do you mean?

558
00:50:19,212 --> 00:50:21,442
Do you honestly believe...

559
00:50:21,514 --> 00:50:24,745
that time can excuse all the things
you've done to me?

560
00:50:24,817 --> 00:50:29,117
- Jewel, please don't. Not here on the public steps.
- Oh, I see.

561
00:50:29,188 --> 00:50:31,213
Not in public.

562
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:34,316
We mustn't speak the truth
out in the open, you and I, huh?

563
00:50:34,394 --> 00:50:36,988
It's not about me that I'm worried.

564
00:50:37,063 --> 00:50:39,896
Well, right here
on the public street...

565
00:50:39,966 --> 00:50:41,900
in the light of day...

566
00:50:41,968 --> 00:50:44,528
let me tell you, Miriam Deering...

567
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:48,096
that murder starts in the heart...

568
00:50:48,174 --> 00:50:51,632
and its first weapon
is a vicious tongue.

569
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:55,670
At the time, would anyone else
have been as kind to you as I?

570
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:59,946
- Would they?
- Go away from me.

571
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:04,456
<i>I'm ill. I'm very ill.</i>

572
00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:09,860
I won't give up
one more thing to you...

573
00:51:12,999 --> 00:51:16,059
not even one more minute.

574
00:51:18,504 --> 00:51:21,234
It's all right, Mrs. Mayhew.
Come along.

575
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,184
<i>A world full of monsters.!</i>

576
00:51:33,252 --> 00:51:38,485
<i>Don't you ever show your white-trash face</i>
<i>in this house again.!</i>

577
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:47,891
<i>Damn.! Just some damn meanness</i>
<i>all day long.</i>

578
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:52,927
<i>Just one filthy mess to clean up</i>
<i>after another. She's nothin'but a child.</i>

579
00:51:53,005 --> 00:51:58,375
<i>She never does anything anyway.</i>

580
00:51:58,444 --> 00:52:01,072
- Velma.
- <i>Huh?</i>

581
00:52:01,147 --> 00:52:03,843
<i>Who brought this</i>
<i>into the house?</i>

582
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:06,783
<i>I did.! I brought it in.</i>

583
00:52:06,853 --> 00:52:08,980
<i>It was in the mailbox</i>
<i>just like that.</i>

584
00:52:09,055 --> 00:52:12,081
<i>I reckon somebody put it there.</i>
<i>You know...</i>

585
00:52:12,158 --> 00:52:15,321
she broke that
dadburned teapot up there.

586
00:52:15,394 --> 00:52:19,353
Tea runnin' all down the wall.
Shoo-ee!

587
00:52:19,432 --> 00:52:22,162
Incidentally, I've managed to find
some women to do the packing.

588
00:52:22,235 --> 00:52:25,932
- Please let me know when they arrive.
- Oh!

589
00:52:26,005 --> 00:52:28,496
Them women, they just steal you
out of house and home.

590
00:52:28,574 --> 00:52:33,375
I got to get something
to fix this filthy stuff.

591
00:52:33,446 --> 00:52:37,382
"Incidentally, please tell me
when they arrive."

592
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:46,651
<i>I told you to stay out.!</i>

593
00:52:57,236 --> 00:52:59,966
Charlotte, you're behaving
like a child...

594
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:03,236
throwing a tantrum over a trivial bit
of rubbish like this.

595
00:53:05,411 --> 00:53:09,609
How can you touch
that piece of filth?

596
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:12,116
It's only a magazine,
cheap and disgusting...

597
00:53:12,184 --> 00:53:14,675
and only cheap and disgusting people
will read it.

598
00:53:14,754 --> 00:53:18,986
It's Jewel Mayhew
deviling me in my own house.

599
00:53:19,058 --> 00:53:22,221
You thinkJewel Mayhew
brought it here?

600
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:25,355
- She couldn't have.
- Why couldn't she have brought it here?

601
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:29,629
I just saw her.
She's seriously ill...

602
00:53:29,702 --> 00:53:33,729
much too ill to be running around
playing silly games with magazines.

603
00:53:33,806 --> 00:53:36,036
Well, she deserves to be ill.

604
00:53:36,108 --> 00:53:38,542
She deserves to die!

605
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:40,636
Charlotte!

606
00:53:40,713 --> 00:53:44,513
It's just possible thatJewel Mayhew
hasn't given you a sustained thought in years.

607
00:53:44,584 --> 00:53:47,075
Oh, you think so, do you?

608
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:49,144
You think she's never
given me a thought?

609
00:54:03,736 --> 00:54:07,695
I've been gettin' these in the mail
ever sinceJohn died.

610
00:54:07,773 --> 00:54:11,106
That idiot Luke Standish told Papa they were...
they were crank notes.

611
00:54:11,177 --> 00:54:14,305
But then some reporter got a hold of'em
and put it in the newspaper.

612
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,406
And then they started to come in
from all over the world.

613
00:54:17,483 --> 00:54:20,179
But the first one was mailed
right here in Hollisport...

614
00:54:20,252 --> 00:54:22,277
and that's where
the last one came from.

615
00:54:22,355 --> 00:54:27,315
And nobody can ever make me believe that
Jewel Mayhew didn't send them!

616
00:54:27,393 --> 00:54:30,260
- You saved all these?
- All of'em...

617
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:34,026
to show how mean
and unforgiving she can be!

618
00:54:35,568 --> 00:54:37,695
Well...

619
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:40,637
it's time you got rid of them.

620
00:54:40,706 --> 00:54:43,675
- What do you want now?
- I come to tell her somethin'.

621
00:54:43,743 --> 00:54:46,337
She could use some tellin'!

622
00:54:46,412 --> 00:54:51,873
Them packin' women
you've been lookin' for, they's arrived.

623
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,110
I'll take care of it.

624
00:55:11,437 --> 00:55:14,770
This is my favorite place now...

625
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,774
here in the shade.

626
00:55:16,842 --> 00:55:18,867
Yes, it's very pleasant here.

627
00:55:18,944 --> 00:55:21,208
Very pleasant indeed.

628
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:25,649
Tell me, Mr. Wills,
weren't you a little surprised...

629
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:27,743
when I agreed to see you?

630
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,984
After all, you must've been told
that I don't normally receive visitors.

631
00:55:32,058 --> 00:55:34,788
Well, yes. But then,
I found the hospitality...

632
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,988
of this part of the country extraordinary.

633
00:55:38,064 --> 00:55:40,555
Besides, I imagine
you had your reasons.

634
00:55:40,633 --> 00:55:42,726
Would you have
anything else, ma'am?

635
00:55:42,802 --> 00:55:46,238
Um, no.

636
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:49,706
- Thank you, Lewis.
- <i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

637
00:55:49,775 --> 00:55:53,404
I did have my reasons, Mr. Wills.

638
00:55:53,479 --> 00:55:57,108
- I did.
- I hope you won't regret it...

639
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:00,641
but I did warn you I'd have to touch
on some painful subjects.

640
00:56:02,121 --> 00:56:04,055
Which leads me to confess...

641
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:06,785
to my own reasons for this meetin'.

642
00:56:08,894 --> 00:56:12,796
I have a particular need
for a stranger now.

643
00:56:12,865 --> 00:56:17,598
Yes, they...
they have their uses, don't they?

644
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,900
Well, in this little town...

645
00:56:19,972 --> 00:56:25,410
our interests are all too, uh...
too tightly interlocked.

646
00:56:25,478 --> 00:56:30,745
If you confide in one person,
you confide in the whole community.

647
00:56:30,816 --> 00:56:33,842
<i>You mean you'd like</i>
<i>somebody to talk to?</i>

648
00:56:33,919 --> 00:56:36,615
Only in a sense.

649
00:56:36,689 --> 00:56:38,623
I'm not a well woman.

650
00:56:38,691 --> 00:56:41,489
You can see that much for yourself.

651
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:46,293
Who was it said,
"This long disease, my life"?

652
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:50,426
Well, it's... it's comin' to an end.

653
00:56:50,503 --> 00:56:55,031
Perhaps a month, a few weeks.
Who knows?

654
00:56:55,107 --> 00:56:57,541
I'm terribly sorry.

655
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:01,102
Oh, no, no.
Don't be, not for me.

656
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:04,479
I think I'm even glad.

657
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,711
But never mind that.
I take it you're no stranger...

658
00:57:06,786 --> 00:57:10,916
to the unhappier aspects
of people's lives.

659
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:14,619
<i>In fact, the only way to trust someone</i>
<i>is on instinct alone.</i>

660
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:18,161
I want you to have this.

661
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:22,894
I only ask that you don't open it
until after I'm gone.

662
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:27,996
Then I want you to use
your own judgment and experience.

663
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:30,940
You'll know what to do
when the time comes...

664
00:57:32,011 --> 00:57:34,002
or what not to do.

665
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:37,708
It seems a dreadful responsibility.

666
00:57:37,783 --> 00:57:39,717
Oh, it is. A terrible one.

667
00:57:39,785 --> 00:57:43,152
My honest advice is to refuse it.

668
00:57:43,222 --> 00:57:45,986
You know I won't, of course.

669
00:57:46,058 --> 00:57:49,255
I know.

670
00:57:49,328 --> 00:57:51,762
Ruined finery.

671
00:57:51,831 --> 00:57:54,561
That's all I have left.

672
00:57:54,633 --> 00:57:58,694
I'm, uh, stony broke.
Is that the phrase?

673
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:02,367
It's a relief to admit it.

674
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:07,435
- But your... your policy with Lloyds?
- Oh!

675
00:58:07,513 --> 00:58:10,812
You know how long it would take
to process an old claim like that?

676
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:15,047
By the time I received it, I'd be past needin' it.

677
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,453
Well, now I think you're ready
for another cup of tea.

678
00:58:18,524 --> 00:58:20,651
Would you?

679
00:58:23,362 --> 00:58:28,061
<i>I hold two roses within my hand</i>

680
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:32,968
<i>Two roses I give to you</i>

681
00:58:34,306 --> 00:58:37,798
<i>The red rose tells you</i>

682
00:58:37,877 --> 00:58:41,438
<i>Of my passion</i>

683
00:58:43,115 --> 00:58:45,913
<i>The white rose</i>

684
00:58:45,985 --> 00:58:50,752
<i>My love so true</i>

685
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:57,656
<i>Hush, hush</i>
<i>sweet Charlotte</i>

686
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:02,292
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

687
00:59:02,368 --> 00:59:06,805
<i>Hush, hush</i>
<i>sweet Charlotte</i>

688
00:59:06,872 --> 00:59:10,137
<i>I'll love you till I die</i>

689
00:59:12,111 --> 00:59:14,773
<i>And every night</i>

690
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:18,681
<i>After I should die</i>

691
00:59:18,751 --> 00:59:21,117
<i>Yes, every night</i>

692
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:24,713
<i>When I'm gone</i>

693
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:30,456
<i>The wind will sing to you</i>

694
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:33,623
<i>This lullaby</i>

695
00:59:35,434 --> 00:59:41,304
<i>Sweet Charlotte was loved</i>

696
00:59:42,608 --> 00:59:45,202
<i>ByJohn</i>

697
00:59:48,747 --> 00:59:50,908
Charlotte.

698
00:59:51,984 --> 00:59:54,111
Charlotte?

699
01:00:05,696 --> 01:00:08,597
Come. Come to bed, Charlotte.

700
01:00:12,503 --> 01:00:14,494
Come to bed.

701
01:00:15,973 --> 01:00:18,066
Miriam...

702
01:00:18,142 --> 01:00:21,077
he really... isn't here, is he?

703
01:00:22,613 --> 01:00:24,979
Just now I thought I heard...

704
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:31,349
Sometimes at night
when I wake up...

705
01:00:32,923 --> 01:00:35,983
it seems as if he really is here.

706
01:00:38,195 --> 01:00:40,129
Don't turn on the light.

707
01:00:40,197 --> 01:00:43,223
It's not real when it's light.

708
01:00:45,236 --> 01:00:47,727
It's only real when it's dark...

709
01:00:50,508 --> 01:00:52,442
dark and still.

710
01:00:54,211 --> 01:00:56,338
I won't turn on the light.

711
01:00:56,414 --> 01:00:58,780
Come along.
You must go to bed.

712
01:01:18,869 --> 01:01:21,337
<i>He's dead.!</i>

713
01:01:22,473 --> 01:01:24,634
<i>He's dead.! He's dead.!</i>

714
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:27,677
He's dead! He's dead!

715
01:01:27,745 --> 01:01:29,975
- Dead! He's dead!
- <i>Charlotte.!</i>

716
01:01:30,047 --> 01:01:32,413
- No, no, he's all right.
- <i>He's dead.!</i>

717
01:01:32,483 --> 01:01:35,111
He'll be fine.

718
01:01:35,186 --> 01:01:38,155
- He's dead! He's dead!
- Charlotte, don't...

719
01:03:14,118 --> 01:03:15,881
Stop starin' at me!

720
01:04:58,756 --> 01:05:02,749
Man, she sure acts...

721
01:05:02,826 --> 01:05:05,989
like she's crazy sometimes.

722
01:05:06,063 --> 01:05:08,896
That's what all the folks
in town say...

723
01:05:08,966 --> 01:05:10,900
but I wouldn't bet on it.

724
01:05:10,968 --> 01:05:13,027
I wouldn't bet on it at all.

725
01:05:29,019 --> 01:05:32,386
<i>Well, upon my word.</i>

726
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:37,150
Charlotte Hollis.

727
01:05:39,229 --> 01:05:42,630
Now I've frightened you.
I'm terribly sorry.

728
01:05:48,572 --> 01:05:50,733
<i>Please don't run away.</i>

729
01:05:50,808 --> 01:05:53,402
I'm quite harmless, I assure you.

730
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:07,780
Would you like a cigarette?

731
01:06:08,926 --> 01:06:10,860
Well, I won't either.

732
01:06:10,928 --> 01:06:12,987
What are you doing
on my property?

733
01:06:13,063 --> 01:06:16,226
Yes, my dear,
it is your property, isn't it?

734
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:20,703
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm snooping. There's no other word for it.

735
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:23,239
- Are you one of the surveyors?
- Oh, no, no.

736
01:06:23,307 --> 01:06:27,038
- I have nothing to do with all that sort of thing.
- Then what's that camera for?

737
01:06:27,111 --> 01:06:31,946
This is a sort of conversation piece.

738
01:06:32,015 --> 01:06:35,075
I say, may I introduce myself?

739
01:06:35,152 --> 01:06:37,143
My name is Harry Wills.

740
01:06:41,892 --> 01:06:45,589
I've come all the way from London
in the hope of meeting you.

741
01:06:45,662 --> 01:06:47,721
Why?

742
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:51,791
Well, we have met before,
you know...

743
01:06:51,869 --> 01:06:53,894
a long time ago.

744
01:06:53,971 --> 01:06:56,633
<i>On the first night</i>
<i>you arrived in London...</i>

745
01:06:56,707 --> 01:06:59,141
<i>when I was a newspaper reporter...</i>

746
01:06:59,209 --> 01:07:02,804
and stood as close to you
as I am now...

747
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,144
for two delightful minutes.

748
01:07:05,215 --> 01:07:07,149
But I didn't talk to any reporters.

749
01:07:07,217 --> 01:07:10,778
I know you didn't,
and you had every reason not to...

750
01:07:10,854 --> 01:07:12,788
the way they behaved toward you.

751
01:07:12,856 --> 01:07:16,383
That's one of the reasons
why I've always hoped I'd meet you again...

752
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:18,690
to apologize.

753
01:07:18,762 --> 01:07:21,731
- You really were there?
- Indeed I was.

754
01:07:21,799 --> 01:07:23,824
And I can prove it to you.

755
01:07:23,901 --> 01:07:26,199
Let me see now.

756
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:28,602
You were dressed in, um...

757
01:07:28,672 --> 01:07:30,799
a sort of, uh...

758
01:07:30,874 --> 01:07:33,104
<i>gray</i>...<i>no, green</i>...

759
01:07:33,177 --> 01:07:36,544
<i>a green suit with a sort of...</i>

760
01:07:36,613 --> 01:07:38,706
<i>Tam-o'- Shanter to match.</i>

761
01:07:38,782 --> 01:07:40,977
<i>Am I right?</i>

762
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:44,316
You see, I was there.

763
01:07:44,388 --> 01:07:49,451
You know, ever since that night I've read almost
everything they've ever printed about you.

764
01:07:49,526 --> 01:07:53,155
In fact, I'm quite
an authority on you.

765
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,698
- You are?
- Yes, indeed I am.

766
01:07:56,834 --> 01:07:59,200
You're my favorite living mystery.

767
01:08:00,771 --> 01:08:02,864
Have you ever solved me?

768
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,374
No.

769
01:08:05,442 --> 01:08:08,502
But then you wouldn't
be a mystery anymore, would you?

770
01:08:11,882 --> 01:08:13,873
No, I wouldn't.

771
01:08:15,619 --> 01:08:19,919
And I'm your... your favorite case
when you got so many to choose from?

772
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:22,083
That's only natural.

773
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:24,423
You have everything.

774
01:08:24,495 --> 01:08:28,295
You're unsolved.
Perhaps even insoluble.

775
01:08:28,365 --> 01:08:31,528
And you have passion
and glamour in your past.

776
01:08:31,602 --> 01:08:34,435
I say, I hope
I'm not offending you.

777
01:08:34,505 --> 01:08:37,099
It's the oddest thing.
You're not.

778
01:08:38,475 --> 01:08:40,875
I don't usually talk to people.

779
01:08:42,012 --> 01:08:44,537
Not about that.

780
01:08:44,615 --> 01:08:48,381
That's why I'm so flattered
that you're talking to me now.

781
01:08:48,452 --> 01:08:52,946
I say, let's go and sit up there
and have a nice little chat, shall we?

782
01:09:08,639 --> 01:09:10,573
Mr. Wills...

783
01:09:11,808 --> 01:09:14,140
since you're an authority on me...

784
01:09:15,879 --> 01:09:18,040
you think I'm a murderess?

785
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:22,280
Do I look like one?

786
01:09:22,352 --> 01:09:25,287
Well, now, let's see.

787
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:30,157
It's rather difficult, isn't it?
But that's as it should be.

788
01:09:32,396 --> 01:09:35,422
They've told you I'm crazy.

789
01:09:35,499 --> 01:09:38,263
<i>Everyone says you are.</i>

790
01:09:38,335 --> 01:09:40,326
<i>Are you?</i>

791
01:09:42,806 --> 01:09:45,331
I used to be positive I wasn't.

792
01:09:47,711 --> 01:09:49,975
But just lately...

793
01:09:51,615 --> 01:09:53,606
at night, it...

794
01:09:54,918 --> 01:09:57,182
it seems as if...

795
01:10:00,023 --> 01:10:02,082
I really don't know anymore.

796
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:05,287
If it comes to that,
how does anyone know?

797
01:10:08,932 --> 01:10:11,196
Would you like to see
inside the house?

798
01:10:11,268 --> 01:10:14,396
<i>I've been wanting to see it for years.</i>

799
01:10:14,471 --> 01:10:16,462
<i>Come on.</i>

800
01:10:20,577 --> 01:10:23,637
Papa used to give the most
beautiful parties here.

801
01:10:23,714 --> 01:10:26,114
They went on for days and days.

802
01:10:26,183 --> 01:10:28,811
You're very fond
of this house, aren't you?

803
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:33,448
I'll show you Papa's library.

804
01:10:33,523 --> 01:10:35,991
Papa built this place
up again, you know.

805
01:10:36,059 --> 01:10:39,085
He bought back a lot
of the original pieces.

806
01:10:39,162 --> 01:10:41,528
Oh.

807
01:10:41,598 --> 01:10:45,762
You're Miss Deering, aren't you?
I had the pleasure of seeing you yesterday.

808
01:10:45,836 --> 01:10:48,430
- My name is Wills. Harry Wills.
- How do you do?

809
01:10:48,505 --> 01:10:52,839
Your cousin's kindly considered
to show me around this lovely old home.

810
01:10:52,909 --> 01:10:54,900
I see.

811
01:10:54,978 --> 01:10:57,469
Excuse me.

812
01:10:57,547 --> 01:11:00,448
Come on.

813
01:11:00,517 --> 01:11:04,851
Papa's library was like a playroom
to me when I was a little bitty.

814
01:11:04,921 --> 01:11:07,981
That's Papa.
He never minded me underfoot.

815
01:11:08,058 --> 01:11:11,662
He never minded a thing I ever did.
He was always so...

816
01:11:11,795 --> 01:11:15,731
<i>Take your hands off that.!</i>

817
01:11:15,799 --> 01:11:18,290
You give that to me!

818
01:11:18,368 --> 01:11:21,166
Now you get out!
You get out, all of you!

819
01:11:21,238 --> 01:11:24,765
- <i>Get out, do you hear me?</i>
<i>You get out and stay out.!</i>
- Go outside. Wait for me outside.

820
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:28,368
- You get out and stay out!
- Charlotte, what's the matter? What did they do?

821
01:11:28,445 --> 01:11:30,936
And you, too, snooping around.

822
01:11:31,014 --> 01:11:33,710
Don't you think I know
what you're looking for in my house?

823
01:11:33,784 --> 01:11:36,651
But what does it matter
if you haven't anything to conceal?

824
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:41,623
Oh, but I have.
I have things concealed. Vile things.

825
01:11:41,692 --> 01:11:45,059
Where do you suppose I keep 'em?
Haven't you guessed?

826
01:11:45,128 --> 01:11:47,062
In here.

827
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:51,590
A memento of my sinful romance.
My lover's hand.

828
01:11:51,668 --> 01:11:54,933
Look! Just look!

829
01:12:09,586 --> 01:12:13,545
It's all... all I have
left of him.

830
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:18,523
A love song he wrote for me...

831
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:22,087
and gave me in a music box.

832
01:12:25,435 --> 01:12:28,404
My dear, Miss Charlotte. Please.

833
01:12:28,472 --> 01:12:31,771
- Oh, John.
- You better leave now.

834
01:12:31,842 --> 01:12:34,208
I was trying to help her.

835
01:12:34,277 --> 01:12:39,078
If you hadn't come here,
this might never have happened.

836
01:12:39,149 --> 01:12:41,140
I'm sorry.

837
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,021
Who put that box in there?

838
01:12:46,089 --> 01:12:49,217
How in the world would I know?

839
01:13:28,298 --> 01:13:30,789
<i>Charlotte.</i>

840
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:55,881
<i>Charlotte.</i>

841
01:14:26,756 --> 01:14:29,987
<i>Charlotte.</i>

842
01:14:32,429 --> 01:14:35,421
<i>Charlotte.</i>

843
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,235
<i>Charlotte.</i>

844
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:45,033
- John?
-

845
01:15:36,993 --> 01:15:39,621
-
- Charlotte?

846
01:15:39,696 --> 01:15:43,257
Charlotte? Charlotte, let me in.

847
01:15:53,610 --> 01:15:55,737
<i>The mirrors.</i>

848
01:15:55,812 --> 01:15:59,646
<i>Charlotte, what happened</i>
<i>to the mirrors?</i>

849
01:16:07,857 --> 01:16:10,325
-
- Charlotte...

850
01:16:10,393 --> 01:16:12,554
what have you done?

851
01:16:22,339 --> 01:16:27,140
It was Papa.
He was so... so tall and so angry.

852
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:29,440
He still hasn't forgiven me.

853
01:16:29,512 --> 01:16:34,882
- No, Charlotte, he loved you.
He wouldn't have harmed you.
- But it was Papa.

854
01:16:34,951 --> 01:16:37,886
It was Papa.
I know it was.

855
01:16:37,954 --> 01:16:42,618
- No, it just seemed that way.
- He was there. He really was.

856
01:16:42,692 --> 01:16:45,217
- He really was.
- No, come along.

857
01:16:45,295 --> 01:16:47,627
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

858
01:16:52,168 --> 01:16:54,762
- Miriam, what are you doing?
- Charlotte.

859
01:16:54,838 --> 01:16:57,466
I'm taking you away
from here today.

860
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,701
- No.
- Drew and I have talked it over.

861
01:16:59,776 --> 01:17:02,574
- And we found a place where
you'll be real comfortable.
- No, I won't go.

862
01:17:02,645 --> 01:17:05,705
- You just get some sleep.
- You have to go before next Monday anyway.

863
01:17:05,782 --> 01:17:09,650
L... I won't go, not while
Jewel Mayhew's still down there.

864
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:12,620
I won't have her see me
driven off my own place.

865
01:17:12,689 --> 01:17:17,126
- Would you rather she sees you
arrested and taken off to jail?
- Luke Standish wouldn't do that.

866
01:17:17,193 --> 01:17:21,254
They'll be policemen and reporters
and photographers everywhere.

867
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,235
Charlotte, after last night,
you must leave here.

868
01:17:27,303 --> 01:17:29,567
You must.

869
01:17:29,639 --> 01:17:33,040
- Last night?
- The music room.

870
01:17:33,109 --> 01:17:35,100
The mirrors.

871
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,454
Where will you take me?

872
01:17:47,223 --> 01:17:50,021
To a nice place...

873
01:17:50,093 --> 01:17:52,391
where people will be kind to you.

874
01:17:52,462 --> 01:17:54,396
You'll see.

875
01:17:54,464 --> 01:17:58,958
But I won't go in the daytime. I won't go
till it's after dark 'causeJewel will see me.

876
01:17:59,035 --> 01:18:01,230
Now, Charlotte,
what difference does that make?

877
01:18:01,304 --> 01:18:03,329
Jewel will have to know
sooner or later.

878
01:18:03,406 --> 01:18:05,340
Now I want Charlotte
to get some sleep.

879
01:18:05,408 --> 01:18:08,104
I'll go downstairs and see about
cleaning up down there.

880
01:18:08,178 --> 01:18:11,909
- What are you gonna do to me?
- Now I want you to get all the rest you can.

881
01:18:11,981 --> 01:18:15,246
You're going to feel a lot better
after you've had a little sleep.

882
01:18:15,318 --> 01:18:18,981
Drew, I didn't break those mirrors.
Really, Drew, I didn't break those mirrors.

883
01:18:19,055 --> 01:18:22,392
Oh, of course
you didn't break the mirrors.

884
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:36,069
Mr. Wills's room.

885
01:18:36,139 --> 01:18:38,107
Yeah. Will you hurry it up?

886
01:18:40,443 --> 01:18:43,241
Mr. Wills? Velma Cruther.

887
01:18:43,312 --> 01:18:47,009
- You told me to call you if...
-

888
01:18:50,086 --> 01:18:54,614
<i>Oh. I'll talk to you later.</i>

889
01:19:00,963 --> 01:19:03,022
I was just using the phone.

890
01:19:03,099 --> 01:19:05,090
So I see.

891
01:19:05,168 --> 01:19:07,728
Miss Charlotte will be
leaving tonight, Velma.

892
01:19:07,804 --> 01:19:10,898
You'll be given your wages
till the end of the month.

893
01:19:10,973 --> 01:19:13,965
You trying to hand me
my walkin' papers?

894
01:19:14,043 --> 01:19:17,171
No, it's just that
you won't be needed any longer.

895
01:19:17,246 --> 01:19:19,646
Is that so?

896
01:19:19,715 --> 01:19:23,776
Well, what about when she comes back?
Or ain't she comin' back?

897
01:19:23,853 --> 01:19:27,846
Since the house won't be here,
I hardly think that's relevant.

898
01:19:27,924 --> 01:19:31,724
Oh, you think so, huh?
You know what I think?

899
01:19:31,794 --> 01:19:33,728
I think if she leaves
this house with you...

900
01:19:33,796 --> 01:19:36,697
she ain't never gonna be
seen nor heard from again.

901
01:19:36,766 --> 01:19:40,793
Anyways, I take my orders
from Miss Charlotte and not from you!

902
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:42,804
It should be obvious,
even to you, Velma...

903
01:19:42,872 --> 01:19:45,466
that my cousin is in no condition
to run a household.

904
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:50,274
Oh, is that so? Well, there's a whole lot
of things that's obvious to me.

905
01:19:52,148 --> 01:19:54,241
The childish tricks
you've been playing here...

906
01:19:54,317 --> 01:19:58,686
trying to frighten me into leaving are more
than sufficient reason to dismiss you.

907
01:19:58,754 --> 01:20:00,745
Tricks?

908
01:20:02,058 --> 01:20:05,221
What are you calling tricks?

909
01:20:05,294 --> 01:20:08,263
Wasn't me that ripped
your dad-burned old dress.

910
01:20:08,331 --> 01:20:11,664
But you seem to know
it was ripped.

911
01:20:11,734 --> 01:20:14,294
And I haven't mentioned it to anyone.

912
01:20:15,404 --> 01:20:19,465
Besides, it isn't just the dress.

913
01:20:19,542 --> 01:20:22,602
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

914
01:20:22,678 --> 01:20:25,238
But I do know
one thing, though.

915
01:20:25,314 --> 01:20:29,512
You're just jealous because
Miss Charlotte always favored me!

916
01:20:29,585 --> 01:20:31,712
You're trying to dupe me
out of the money...

917
01:20:31,787 --> 01:20:35,086
that she promised me
when she passes away!

918
01:20:35,157 --> 01:20:38,820
Oh, that's charming.

919
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:42,764
Quite charming.

920
01:20:42,832 --> 01:20:45,164
My cousin just happens
to be a little ill...

921
01:20:45,234 --> 01:20:48,226
and you're already
dividing up the spoils.

922
01:20:48,304 --> 01:20:50,704
I didn't mean it.

923
01:20:50,773 --> 01:20:54,607
I did not mean it that way,
and you damn well know it!

924
01:20:54,677 --> 01:20:59,376
Anyways, you don't have no call to be
so high and mighty.

925
01:20:59,448 --> 01:21:02,815
I seen all that fancy foreign mail
that you've been gettin'.

926
01:21:02,885 --> 01:21:05,945
You think I don't know a due bill
when I see one?

927
01:21:06,022 --> 01:21:08,547
You had it in for me since the first time
you come to this house.

928
01:21:08,624 --> 01:21:12,355
And you know why?
'Cause I can see right through you.

929
01:21:12,428 --> 01:21:16,023
You didn't fool me then,
and you sure as hell don't fool me now.

930
01:21:16,098 --> 01:21:19,659
My dear Velma,
I wouldn't dream of trying.

931
01:21:19,735 --> 01:21:23,637
But the point is you're fired.
You're just not needed any longer.

932
01:21:23,706 --> 01:21:26,300
Well, I'm not gonna clear out
just 'cause you say so.

933
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:29,867
I've been lookin' after Miss Charlotte
since before you come here, and she knows it.

934
01:21:29,946 --> 01:21:32,312
Where do you think you're going?

935
01:21:32,381 --> 01:21:35,043
<i>I'm goin'upstairs, and I'm gonna tell her</i>
<i>what you've been up to.!</i>

936
01:21:35,117 --> 01:21:38,848
<i>Don't you dare go up there</i>
<i>and bother her.</i>

937
01:21:38,921 --> 01:21:41,116
Mm-hmm.

938
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:45,024
What's going on up there
that you don't want me to see?

939
01:21:45,094 --> 01:21:48,222
<i>Now, Velma, Miss Miriam's</i>
<i>more than qualified...</i>

940
01:21:48,297 --> 01:21:50,288
to look after Miss Charlotte...

941
01:21:50,366 --> 01:21:53,824
and to take care
of closing up the house.

942
01:21:53,903 --> 01:21:55,894
Oh.

943
01:21:57,306 --> 01:22:00,742
So you're in on this together, huh?

944
01:22:01,744 --> 01:22:03,678
You and her.

945
01:22:03,746 --> 01:22:06,772
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

946
01:22:06,849 --> 01:22:09,010
Miss Charlotte's sick.

947
01:22:09,085 --> 01:22:12,782
You're not gonna help her
get well by kicking up all this ruckus.

948
01:22:12,855 --> 01:22:14,846
Oh, all right!

949
01:22:15,858 --> 01:22:18,520
All right, I'm goin'.

950
01:22:18,594 --> 01:22:22,587
But don't think
you're not gonna be sorry!

951
01:22:22,665 --> 01:22:24,656
Both of you!

952
01:22:27,136 --> 01:22:31,266
What in the world does she think
we're gonna be sorry about?

953
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,570
She's always been
insanely jealous...

954
01:22:33,643 --> 01:22:36,510
of anyone who was
close to Charlotte.

955
01:22:36,579 --> 01:22:39,878
I guess it's something
she just can't be rational about.

956
01:22:43,853 --> 01:22:46,151
You haven't got much
to go on, really.

957
01:22:46,222 --> 01:22:49,020
I got what I know, don't I?

958
01:22:49,091 --> 01:22:53,255
I know the state Miss Charlotte's been in
ever since that fool woman come here!

959
01:22:53,329 --> 01:22:55,729
She wouldn't have smashed
them mirrors that way...

960
01:22:55,798 --> 01:22:59,734
if somebody didn't have her good
and worked up about something.

961
01:22:59,802 --> 01:23:02,362
She loves that old house.

962
01:23:02,438 --> 01:23:04,372
She really does.

963
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:08,740
Yes, but even allowing that there may be
some cause for concern...

964
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,648
what can I do?

965
01:23:12,715 --> 01:23:14,649
You could do somethin'!

966
01:23:14,717 --> 01:23:16,912
She likes you.

967
01:23:16,986 --> 01:23:20,319
I seen how she was with you.

968
01:23:20,389 --> 01:23:25,520
Now, if you was to...
if you was to go out there...

969
01:23:25,594 --> 01:23:28,859
and you were to tell her
not to listen to them...

970
01:23:28,931 --> 01:23:33,027
I think she'd mind what you say.

971
01:23:33,102 --> 01:23:36,037
I must admit, the whole thing
seems strangely odd to me.

972
01:23:36,105 --> 01:23:38,539
If they take my Miss Charlotte away
from that house...

973
01:23:38,607 --> 01:23:41,371
I ain't gonna never see her again.

974
01:23:41,444 --> 01:23:45,312
I knows it. I just knows it!

975
01:23:45,414 --> 01:23:48,406
You feeling all right, Charlotte?

976
01:23:48,484 --> 01:23:51,544
Somebody has to finish
your packing for you, don't they?

977
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:55,078
You don't want to leave
all your things behind, do you?

978
01:23:55,157 --> 01:23:57,148
Do you?

979
01:24:22,752 --> 01:24:24,743
Papa.

980
01:24:28,991 --> 01:24:31,221
Papa, I'm going to have
to leave the house.

981
01:24:31,293 --> 01:24:35,627
I tried to keep the house,
but they're tearing it down.

982
01:24:35,698 --> 01:24:37,859
I can't help it.

983
01:24:40,302 --> 01:24:42,429
Don't be angry.

984
01:24:44,006 --> 01:24:47,066
I've lived alone here
all these years to protect you.

985
01:24:47,143 --> 01:24:49,168
You know that.

986
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:58,884
Just because I loved John
more than I loved you...

987
01:24:58,954 --> 01:25:01,684
didn't give you the right
to murder him just to punish me!

988
01:25:06,996 --> 01:25:10,591
John never hurt you.
John never even...

989
01:25:44,133 --> 01:25:45,896
One more time, baby.

990
01:25:45,968 --> 01:25:50,029
Just one more time.
Nice. Now hold still.

991
01:25:50,105 --> 01:25:51,732
Once again.

992
01:25:51,807 --> 01:25:55,243
Thanks. Remind me to
send you one for Christmas.

993
01:26:07,823 --> 01:26:10,257
<i>Charlotte?</i>

994
01:26:11,727 --> 01:26:14,560
Charlotte? Charlotte, what is it?

995
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:50,230
How is she?

996
01:26:50,299 --> 01:26:53,063
She'll keep. Oh.

997
01:26:53,135 --> 01:26:55,330
Wanna help me get rid of this?

998
01:26:58,941 --> 01:27:02,433
It's almost too real, isn't it?

999
01:27:02,511 --> 01:27:07,175
Your artist friend in New Orleans
has quite a talent.

1000
01:27:07,249 --> 01:27:11,117
- And a minimum of curiosity.
- Do you think it's done the job?

1001
01:27:11,186 --> 01:27:15,316
Not quite. We could probably achieve
the rest with this drug...

1002
01:27:15,391 --> 01:27:17,723
but the effect
wouldn't be permanent.

1003
01:27:17,793 --> 01:27:19,727
Besides, chemically it's traceable.

1004
01:27:19,795 --> 01:27:22,730
Then we'll have to
go through with the rest?

1005
01:27:22,798 --> 01:27:26,290
Don't you worry.
After the last phase of treatment...

1006
01:27:26,368 --> 01:27:30,737
there won't be a doctor in Louisiana
who wouldn't commit her.

1007
01:27:30,806 --> 01:27:34,799
Then establishing
your right to handle the estate...

1008
01:27:34,877 --> 01:27:37,243
should take...

1009
01:27:37,313 --> 01:27:40,146
oh, just a few days.

1010
01:27:44,386 --> 01:27:46,581
Good morning, Charlotte.

1011
01:27:49,391 --> 01:27:52,224
- Where's Velma?
- You let her go yesterday.

1012
01:27:52,294 --> 01:27:54,285
You fired her.

1013
01:27:55,864 --> 01:28:00,631
- Fired?
- You're not going to need her any longer.

1014
01:28:00,703 --> 01:28:03,263
I had a terrible dream.

1015
01:28:04,373 --> 01:28:06,364
- Terrible.
- I know.

1016
01:28:06,442 --> 01:28:09,275
You'll stop having them
once you're away from here.

1017
01:28:09,345 --> 01:28:11,939
Now you eat your breakfast.

1018
01:28:13,882 --> 01:28:17,045
And I'll come back later
and see how you are.

1019
01:29:36,832 --> 01:29:40,359
Miss Charlotte?

1020
01:29:41,904 --> 01:29:44,031
<i>Miss Charlotte?</i>

1021
01:29:54,116 --> 01:29:56,107
Miss Charlotte.

1022
01:29:59,054 --> 01:30:01,852
What have they
been givin' you?

1023
01:30:06,995 --> 01:30:09,691
That's some kind of drug, ain't it?

1024
01:30:12,067 --> 01:30:15,332
Oh, Miss Charlotte.

1025
01:30:15,404 --> 01:30:20,398
- I thought you'd gone.
- Well, I was gone. They kicked me out...

1026
01:30:20,476 --> 01:30:24,503
Miss Miriam and your friend
Dr. Drew.

1027
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:28,482
I told that to Mr. Wills,
but he wouldn't listen.

1028
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:32,452
You can't go that way.
Miss Charlotte, I've gotta get your coat.

1029
01:30:34,123 --> 01:30:37,092
Your shoes.
You can't go there.

1030
01:30:37,159 --> 01:30:39,753
Come on, Miss Charlotte.
Come on, Miss Charlotte.

1031
01:30:39,828 --> 01:30:41,921
I've gotta get you out of here.

1032
01:30:41,997 --> 01:30:45,694
- Come on, honey. We gotta go outta here.
-

1033
01:30:49,037 --> 01:30:51,528
Miss Charlotte. Come on, darling.

1034
01:30:51,607 --> 01:30:54,405
Don't you say anything.
You hush now, ya hear?

1035
01:30:54,476 --> 01:30:57,673
Don't you say a word.
Come on, Miss Charlotte.

1036
01:30:59,448 --> 01:31:01,746
Miss Charlotte,
don't say anything. Shh.

1037
01:31:01,817 --> 01:31:04,513
Shh. Be quiet.
Don't say anything.

1038
01:31:07,823 --> 01:31:10,314
Oh, my!

1039
01:31:10,392 --> 01:31:12,587
Shh, Miss Charlotte.

1040
01:31:24,072 --> 01:31:26,370
You'll be able
to eat something later.

1041
01:31:30,879 --> 01:31:33,347
I'll take this away.

1042
01:31:33,415 --> 01:31:35,975
Is there anything you want
before I leave?

1043
01:31:55,003 --> 01:31:57,403
I'll look in on you later.

1044
01:32:10,886 --> 01:32:13,514
Now get some rest.

1045
01:32:28,604 --> 01:32:30,970
Come on, Miss Charlotte.
You gotta wake up now. Come on.

1046
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:33,906
- No. No, Velma, no!
- Shh! You gotta be quiet, honey.

1047
01:32:33,976 --> 01:32:37,605
Come on. Put your legs over here.
That's right.

1048
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:40,842
You gotta put this coat on.
Put your little hand in here now.

1049
01:32:40,916 --> 01:32:43,646
Come on. Put your little hand
in there. That's right.

1050
01:32:43,719 --> 01:32:46,210
Come on. Now give me
your other hand.

1051
01:32:46,288 --> 01:32:48,722
That's good. Get it in there.

1052
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:51,224
<i>Come on. Give me your other one.</i>

1053
01:32:59,468 --> 01:33:03,461
You just can't keep hogs
away from the trough, can you?

1054
01:33:03,538 --> 01:33:05,472
I come to get my things.

1055
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:08,008
Is my cousin one of your things?

1056
01:33:08,076 --> 01:33:11,239
I'm taking her outta here...

1057
01:33:11,313 --> 01:33:13,178
<i>away from you.!</i>

1058
01:33:13,248 --> 01:33:16,513
The only thing
you're taking out of here is you!

1059
01:33:16,585 --> 01:33:19,076
Miss Charlotte! Miss Charlotte!

1060
01:33:23,893 --> 01:33:28,694
So you're finally showin'
the right side of your face, ain't ya?

1061
01:33:28,764 --> 01:33:31,494
Well, I seen it all the time.

1062
01:33:31,567 --> 01:33:36,698
That's some kind of drug
that you've been givin' her.

1063
01:33:36,772 --> 01:33:41,402
You've been makin' her act
the way she's been.

1064
01:33:41,477 --> 01:33:44,139
Well, I'm goin' into town...

1065
01:33:44,213 --> 01:33:48,445
and I'm goin' to tell them
what you been up to.

1066
01:34:57,653 --> 01:35:01,020
Dr. Bayliss, please. Yes, Bayliss.

1067
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:04,423
And hurry. Please hurry.

1068
01:35:04,493 --> 01:35:06,427
<i>Sit down.</i>

1069
01:35:07,763 --> 01:35:11,028
You seem awfully nervous.

1070
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:15,161
He was always fighting
to keep two things...

1071
01:35:15,237 --> 01:35:17,171
<i>his daughter and his money.</i>

1072
01:35:17,239 --> 01:35:19,207
And now he's gonna lose both.

1073
01:35:19,275 --> 01:35:22,938
Gotta hand it to him. He held on
to both of'em an awful long time...

1074
01:35:23,012 --> 01:35:26,140
even after he died.

1075
01:35:26,215 --> 01:35:30,549
I suppose in a way he's got Charlotte
to thank for that.

1076
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:33,111
If she hadn't deluded
herself into believing...

1077
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:38,559
it was dear old Papa
who killed John Mayhew...

1078
01:35:38,628 --> 01:35:43,964
she might never have stayed here
guarding that so-called, uh, secret.

1079
01:35:44,033 --> 01:35:47,161
She might have gone off
and spent the entire fortune.

1080
01:35:47,236 --> 01:35:50,364
Are you sure it's all right?

1081
01:35:50,439 --> 01:35:52,373
Sure what's all right?

1082
01:35:52,441 --> 01:35:55,467
Don't make fun of me!

1083
01:35:55,544 --> 01:35:58,877
Oh, you mean Velma.

1084
01:35:58,948 --> 01:36:03,544
Of course it's all right. Nobody's ever
gonna know it wasn't an accident.

1085
01:36:05,521 --> 01:36:08,388
Except me, of course.

1086
01:36:08,457 --> 01:36:11,153
Which rather tends to make me
the senior partner...

1087
01:36:11,227 --> 01:36:13,627
in our little enterprise,
doesn't it?

1088
01:36:13,696 --> 01:36:17,188
Charlotte's still asleep.
Do you want me to give her anything else?

1089
01:36:17,266 --> 01:36:22,169
No, no. She'll do
quite nicely as she is.

1090
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:26,368
Well, I'd better put in
an appearance in town.

1091
01:36:28,911 --> 01:36:30,879
Oh, come on, Miriam.

1092
01:36:30,946 --> 01:36:33,915
Don't start weakenin' now.

1093
01:36:33,983 --> 01:36:37,180
This may be our last chance
of acquiring the wealth...

1094
01:36:37,253 --> 01:36:40,120
to which I'd like
to become accustomed.

1095
01:36:44,226 --> 01:36:46,217
See you.

1096
01:36:55,671 --> 01:36:57,832
It's all yours, Mr. Wills.

1097
01:36:57,907 --> 01:37:00,933
Thank you, Sheriff.

1098
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:04,036
Hi, Mr. Wills.
I'll bet this is the first time...

1099
01:37:04,113 --> 01:37:08,072
you've ever seen the county coroner
operate out of a funeral parlor, eh?

1100
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:11,210
Yes. It's a bit different
where I come from.

1101
01:37:11,287 --> 01:37:13,721
It's a bit different most places.

1102
01:37:13,789 --> 01:37:17,418
Still, for a town of this size,
it's kind of handy.

1103
01:37:17,493 --> 01:37:20,394
I just heard the news about
Velma Cruther's death...

1104
01:37:20,463 --> 01:37:22,954
at the newspaper office.

1105
01:37:23,032 --> 01:37:26,968
- It was Miss Cruther he came to see, wasn't it?
- Oh, yes, indeed, sir.

1106
01:37:27,036 --> 01:37:30,597
She certainly had
a nasty accident, all right.

1107
01:37:30,673 --> 01:37:34,700
- Would you like to see the body?
- No, thank you.

1108
01:37:34,777 --> 01:37:37,940
Oh. Well, step inside anyway.

1109
01:37:42,184 --> 01:37:44,744
May I ask how it happened?

1110
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:49,450
Well, it seems she, uh...
she fell off a ladder.

1111
01:37:49,525 --> 01:37:52,722
She must have been
up there fixing her roof.

1112
01:37:52,795 --> 01:37:56,458
The roof in her place
has always let in the rain.

1113
01:37:56,532 --> 01:37:59,865
And, uh, well, it's done it for years.

1114
01:37:59,935 --> 01:38:02,961
You mean this happened
at Miss Cruther's home?

1115
01:38:03,038 --> 01:38:06,371
Well, I'd hardly
call it a home, sir...

1116
01:38:06,442 --> 01:38:09,343
but she did fall in her own backyard.

1117
01:38:09,411 --> 01:38:12,710
I see. Who found her?

1118
01:38:12,782 --> 01:38:15,649
Well, I couldn't tell you that, sir...

1119
01:38:15,718 --> 01:38:18,881
but it was Dr. Bayliss
that brought her in.

1120
01:38:46,949 --> 01:38:52,854
Charlotte.

1121
01:38:52,922 --> 01:38:57,518
Charlotte.

1122
01:38:59,428 --> 01:39:05,389
Charlotte.

1123
01:39:06,669 --> 01:39:10,105
Charlotte.

1124
01:39:12,808 --> 01:39:16,266
Hush, hush
sweet Charlotte

1125
01:39:16,345 --> 01:39:20,406
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

1126
01:39:22,651 --> 01:39:26,109
Hush, hush
sweet Charlotte

1127
01:39:27,423 --> 01:39:31,484
<i>I'll love you till I die</i>

1128
01:39:34,463 --> 01:39:37,523
<i>Oh, hold me, darlin'</i>

1129
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,125
<i>Please hold me close</i>

1130
01:39:40,202 --> 01:39:42,693
<i>And brush the tears</i>

1131
01:39:42,771 --> 01:39:45,604
<i>From your eyes</i>

1132
01:39:45,674 --> 01:39:51,044
<i>You weep because</i>
<i>you had a dream last night</i>

1133
01:39:51,113 --> 01:39:55,447
<i>You dreamed</i>
<i>that I said good-bye</i>

1134
01:39:57,253 --> 01:40:01,747
<i>Hush, hush</i>
<i>sweet Charlotte</i>

1135
01:40:01,824 --> 01:40:05,885
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

1136
01:40:12,334 --> 01:40:14,325
<i>Charlotte.</i>

1137
01:40:17,373 --> 01:40:19,841
John?

1138
01:40:22,711 --> 01:40:25,908
John, wait! Don't go.

1139
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:33,916
<i>Hush, hush</i>
<i>sweet Charlotte</i>

1140
01:40:35,157 --> 01:40:39,685
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

1141
01:40:46,902 --> 01:40:48,426
John?

1142
01:40:55,377 --> 01:40:57,311
John?

1143
01:44:50,946 --> 01:44:52,937
John?

1144
01:44:54,316 --> 01:44:56,443
Don't go away.

1145
01:44:59,388 --> 01:45:01,288
John?

1146
01:45:02,558 --> 01:45:05,152
Please don't go away!

1147
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:50,161
Papa?

1148
01:46:04,019 --> 01:46:05,953
Charlotte.

1149
01:46:10,726 --> 01:46:12,660
John.

1150
01:47:59,801 --> 01:48:01,962
You idiot.

1151
01:48:02,037 --> 01:48:04,038
You wretched idiot!

1152
01:48:05,839 --> 01:48:08,865
He's dead.

1153
01:48:10,177 --> 01:48:12,441
And you killed him.

1154
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:24,917
Miriam!

1155
01:48:24,992 --> 01:48:27,620
Miriam!

1156
01:48:27,694 --> 01:48:31,255
Don't call the sheriff.

1157
01:48:31,331 --> 01:48:33,492
People staring at me
and hating me.

1158
01:48:33,567 --> 01:48:36,331
It will be just like the night
when John was murdered.

1159
01:48:36,403 --> 01:48:39,531
But you killed Drew.
We can't just pretend it never happened.

1160
01:48:39,606 --> 01:48:43,133
You don't know what it's like when hate
is everywhere. You can't feel it.

1161
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:45,269
Oh, Miriam,
don't you hate me too.

1162
01:48:45,345 --> 01:48:48,439
Oh, please, Charlotte.
Please, please don't.

1163
01:48:48,515 --> 01:48:52,349
I didn't mean to kill him.
The gun was just there in-in my hand.

1164
01:48:52,419 --> 01:48:55,217
And-And when I saw him,
he looked so horrible.

1165
01:48:55,289 --> 01:48:58,781
It was just like the night when...
when the mirrors were all smashed...

1166
01:48:58,859 --> 01:49:01,293
and just like the night
when I saw that hand.

1167
01:49:01,361 --> 01:49:06,765
Oh, Miriam... Miriam, please don't call
the sheriff. I just couldn't stand it!

1168
01:49:06,834 --> 01:49:09,803
Oh, Charlotte, don't.

1169
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:12,998
We could get rid of the body.
We could hide it somewhere.

1170
01:49:13,073 --> 01:49:17,305
Then people would think someone else
had done it. That's the only thing to do.

1171
01:49:17,377 --> 01:49:19,811
Miriam... Miriam,
I've got lots of money.

1172
01:49:22,249 --> 01:49:24,740
<i>I'll give it to you, all of it.</i>

1173
01:49:24,818 --> 01:49:27,878
<i>We really could get rid</i>
<i>of the body if you'd help me.</i>

1174
01:49:27,955 --> 01:49:30,287
We could get rid of it
if you'd help me.

1175
01:49:35,229 --> 01:49:39,495
- Oh, I wish to God I'd never come here.
-

1176
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:52,505
I'll get the car. You turn out the lights.

1177
01:49:52,579 --> 01:49:54,877
Well, go!

1178
01:50:02,623 --> 01:50:05,524
- Get in there and stay quiet.
-

1179
01:50:05,592 --> 01:50:07,890
Get in there!

1180
01:50:15,836 --> 01:50:19,738
Miss Deering, I hope you'll forgive me
for popping in at this time.

1181
01:50:19,806 --> 01:50:23,242
<i>I happened to be out driving</i>
<i>with a friend when I noticed the lights.</i>

1182
01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:27,007
I've heard the news about
Velma Cruther's death.

1183
01:50:32,419 --> 01:50:35,718
<i>What a terrible thing.</i>
<i>She was such a loyal person.</i>

1184
01:50:37,457 --> 01:50:40,358
<i>I'm quite sure Miss Hollis</i>
<i>must be terribly upset about it.</i>

1185
01:50:40,427 --> 01:50:42,952
<i>I wonder if there's anything I can do?</i>

1186
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:46,227
It's very kind of you,
but, no, there isn't anything.

1187
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:48,427
<i>Charlotte was upset.</i>

1188
01:50:48,502 --> 01:50:52,734
<i>I've given her a sedative</i>
<i>and put her to bed.</i>

1189
01:50:52,806 --> 01:50:55,274
- <i>It was a dreadful shock for her.</i>
- <i>I'm terribly sorry.</i>

1190
01:50:55,342 --> 01:50:57,537
<i>Please give her my sympathy.</i>

1191
01:50:57,611 --> 01:51:00,102
<i>I'm sorry I can't ask you in.</i>

1192
01:51:00,180 --> 01:51:02,671
It's quite all right.
I shouldn't have come.

1193
01:51:02,749 --> 01:51:06,014
It's very late. I just happened
to be passing, that was all.

1194
01:51:06,086 --> 01:51:09,886
- You understand.
- Yes, of course. Thank you, Mr. Wills. Good night.

1195
01:51:09,957 --> 01:51:14,223
Uh, by the way,
I understand you'll be leaving...

1196
01:51:14,294 --> 01:51:16,819
<i>this house in a matter of days now,</i>
<i>you and your cousin.</i>

1197
01:51:16,897 --> 01:51:21,300
<i> Well, of course our plans</i>
<i>are indefinite now.</i>

1198
01:51:21,368 --> 01:51:23,302
<i>Naturally, they would be.</i>

1199
01:51:23,370 --> 01:51:26,828
<i>Mr. Wills,</i>
<i>you'll have to excuse me.</i>

1200
01:51:26,907 --> 01:51:29,000
I must look in on Charlotte.

1201
01:51:29,076 --> 01:51:31,636
Excuse me, please.
Good night.

1202
01:51:31,712 --> 01:51:35,170
<i>Good night.</i>

1203
01:52:14,021 --> 01:52:16,182
I don't think I can help you.

1204
01:52:18,191 --> 01:52:20,921
You can't help <i>me?</i>

1205
01:52:20,994 --> 01:52:23,462
I'm the one that's helping you!

1206
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:25,464
Do you want me to wash my hands
of the whole thing?

1207
01:52:25,532 --> 01:52:29,059
Call the sheriff?
Is that what you want?

1208
01:52:29,136 --> 01:52:32,230
Well, all right, then.

1209
01:52:46,153 --> 01:52:49,145
<i>Hey, turn your lights on.!</i>

1210
01:53:08,308 --> 01:53:11,766
I must be the worst person
in the world...

1211
01:53:11,845 --> 01:53:13,870
to have killed Drew.

1212
01:53:13,947 --> 01:53:16,472
Will you please shut up?

1213
01:53:28,028 --> 01:53:30,428
Miriam, l-I can't touch him.

1214
01:53:45,912 --> 01:53:49,473
- Don't make me do it, Miriam.
- Get out!

1215
01:53:55,422 --> 01:53:57,754
Do what I say!

1216
01:54:24,885 --> 01:54:27,319
Well?

1217
01:55:16,503 --> 01:55:19,028
Will you stop that!

1218
01:55:21,875 --> 01:55:24,343
Miriam, they'll... they'll be
finding him soon...

1219
01:55:24,411 --> 01:55:26,470
and-and they'll be asking questions...

1220
01:55:26,546 --> 01:55:29,811
and l-l-I don't think
l- I could lie to 'em.

1221
01:55:29,883 --> 01:55:33,011
You-You-You... You'll have...
You'll have to tell 'em, Miriam...

1222
01:55:33,086 --> 01:55:35,486
I'm not able to answer questions.

1223
01:55:35,555 --> 01:55:39,792
'Cause they'll find out if you don't.
They'll find out, Miriam.

1224
01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:57,272
Damn you!

1225
01:55:57,342 --> 01:56:01,278
Now will you shut your mouth?

1226
01:56:03,348 --> 01:56:05,282
You'll do as I tell you.

1227
01:56:05,350 --> 01:56:09,286
And if I tell you to lie,
you'll do that too.

1228
01:56:09,354 --> 01:56:13,518
I'm never going to suffer
for you again.

1229
01:56:13,592 --> 01:56:16,026
Not ever.

1230
01:56:16,094 --> 01:56:18,995
Do you understand?

1231
01:56:49,628 --> 01:56:51,562
Get out.

1232
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:54,326
<i>Get out and go up to your room.</i>

1233
01:56:54,399 --> 01:56:56,390
Go ahead!

1234
01:56:59,872 --> 01:57:02,636
<i>I'm going to clean out the back,</i>
<i>and I'll be up in a minute.</i>

1235
01:57:02,708 --> 01:57:04,505
Well, go on!

1236
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:28,285
<i>Go up to your room.</i>

1237
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:30,624
<i>Well, go on.!</i>

1238
01:58:30,696 --> 01:58:33,824
<i>Go on.! Go on.!</i>

1239
01:59:56,281 --> 01:59:58,613
Hush...

1240
01:59:58,683 --> 02:00:02,016
hush, sweet Charlotte.

1241
02:00:45,430 --> 02:00:47,990
I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting.

1242
02:00:49,234 --> 02:00:51,634
To your very good health.

1243
02:00:51,703 --> 02:00:54,365
- You look absolutely ravishing.
- Thank you, sir.

1244
02:00:54,439 --> 02:00:57,567
I bet Lazarus never felt
as good as I do.

1245
02:00:57,642 --> 02:00:59,735
To Venice in the spring.

1246
02:00:59,811 --> 02:01:01,711
Venice?

1247
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:04,908
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm not certain...

1248
02:01:04,983 --> 02:01:07,747
that I shall want to live in Europe.

1249
02:01:09,154 --> 02:01:11,088
I don't see that what you want...

1250
02:01:11,156 --> 02:01:13,488
has anything to do
with where we go.

1251
02:01:13,558 --> 02:01:17,654
You forget that Velma's tragic departure...

1252
02:01:17,729 --> 02:01:22,689
has allowed me to become
the senior partner of our little enterprise.

1253
02:01:22,767 --> 02:01:26,498
Are you sure you have the brains
to be the senior partner?

1254
02:01:27,839 --> 02:01:30,706
I, uh, don't think I follow you.

1255
02:01:32,477 --> 02:01:35,571
Who do you suppose
helped to set up cousin Charlotte...

1256
02:01:35,647 --> 02:01:39,481
for this little comedy by sending
her all those charming notes?

1257
02:01:39,551 --> 02:01:41,951
Well, naturallyJewel Mayhew.

1258
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:44,113
Jewel?

1259
02:01:44,189 --> 02:01:47,386
Jewel Mayhew hasn't done a thing
in years and years...

1260
02:01:47,459 --> 02:01:51,327
except keep me in comfort
until her money ran out.

1261
02:01:54,499 --> 02:01:56,694
I sent Charlotte all those notes.

1262
02:01:56,768 --> 02:01:58,759
You...

1263
02:01:59,771 --> 02:02:01,932
And Jewel Mayhew?

1264
02:02:11,216 --> 02:02:14,583
My notes toJewel had
a more practical purpose.

1265
02:02:14,653 --> 02:02:18,749
The one good thing that ever happened
to me in this house...

1266
02:02:18,823 --> 02:02:23,556
was seeing Jewel Mayhew
go out to the summerhouse that night.

1267
02:02:26,498 --> 02:02:29,296
She paid me handsomely
for that indiscretion.

1268
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:37,174
She <i>paid</i> you?

1269
02:02:51,957 --> 02:02:56,985
Jewel murdered her husband,
and you could actually bring yourself...

1270
02:02:57,062 --> 02:03:01,829
to make both her and Charlotte
suffer for it all these years?

1271
02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:04,095
Yes, darling.

1272
02:03:04,169 --> 02:03:06,433
That's exactly what I did.

1273
02:03:06,504 --> 02:03:09,268
<i>Do you still feel</i>
<i>you have the imagination...</i>

1274
02:03:09,341 --> 02:03:12,105
<i>to be the senior member</i>
<i>of this partnership?</i>

1275
02:03:16,214 --> 02:03:18,614
<i>Evidently not.</i>

1276
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:24,917
<i> I didn't know you had</i>
<i>such a dulcet baritone.</i>

1277
02:03:24,990 --> 02:03:28,448
<i>Well, you attended the wrong Sunday school</i>
<i>when I was a choirboy.</i>

1278
02:03:28,526 --> 02:03:31,495
<i>So, you see, my dear...</i>

1279
02:03:31,563 --> 02:03:33,929
you've joined this game
somewhat later than you thought.

1280
02:03:33,999 --> 02:03:36,194
I did indeed.

1281
02:03:36,268 --> 02:03:38,668
If you'd known earlier,
would you have trusted me...

1282
02:03:38,737 --> 02:03:41,035
<i>not to put real bullets</i>
<i>in that gun tonight?</i>

1283
02:03:41,106 --> 02:03:45,167
<i>No, ma'am, Miss Miriam.</i>
<i>I don't believe I would.</i>

1284
02:03:47,345 --> 02:03:51,543
I would be careful
not to over-celebrate too soon.

1285
02:03:51,616 --> 02:03:55,279
We've still got one more show
to put on first thing in the morning.

1286
02:03:55,353 --> 02:03:57,583
- So early?
- Yes.

1287
02:03:57,656 --> 02:04:00,716
<i>I asked the folks from the state institution</i>
<i>to come over here about 10:00.</i>

1288
02:04:00,792 --> 02:04:03,317
You mean I shall have
to wring my hands...

1289
02:04:03,395 --> 02:04:06,057
in abject misery
and humiliation...

1290
02:04:06,131 --> 02:04:10,397
at the disgrace of having a member
of our fine old family...

1291
02:04:10,468 --> 02:04:12,629
committed to
the local madhouse?

1292
02:04:12,704 --> 02:04:14,729
Fine old family, indeed.

1293
02:04:14,806 --> 02:04:19,402
Sam Hollis was nothing but
a thieving, fat fraud. And...

1294
02:04:23,315 --> 02:04:25,340
-
- And furthermore...

1295
02:04:25,417 --> 02:04:28,079
<i>he and John Mayhew...</i>

1296
02:04:28,153 --> 02:04:31,680
<i>were the biggest</i>
<i>two damn womanizers...</i>

1297
02:04:31,756 --> 02:04:34,725
<i>in the whole state of Louisiana.</i>

1298
02:04:34,793 --> 02:04:36,727
Oh, dear, all that lovely money...

1299
02:04:36,795 --> 02:04:39,787
that Big Sam sweated
to get his hands on.

1300
02:04:39,864 --> 02:04:41,798
While we're spending it
like water...

1301
02:04:41,866 --> 02:04:45,768
Charlotte will be weaving lots
and lots of little baskets.

1302
02:04:45,837 --> 02:04:48,567
Oh, don't distress yourself, darling.

1303
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:52,041
There's nothing wrong
with basket weaving.

1304
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:55,273
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>it never cured anybody...</i>

1305
02:04:55,347 --> 02:04:57,975
but it is most therapeutic.

1306
02:05:00,352 --> 02:05:04,618
I can just see Charlotte's face
when those doctors at the institution...

1307
02:05:04,689 --> 02:05:08,819
<i>call</i> you <i>in</i>
<i>to confirm their opinion.</i>

1308
02:05:08,893 --> 02:05:12,886
<i> When she sees me</i>
<i>walk in there tomorrow morning...</i>

1309
02:05:12,964 --> 02:05:16,900
<i>she'll let out such a scream</i>
<i>that they'll never let her out.</i>

1310
02:05:54,272 --> 02:05:56,672
The way I heard it,
that Deering woman...

1311
02:05:56,741 --> 02:06:00,734
didn't have nothin'
but a flimsy peekaboo dress on.

1312
02:06:00,812 --> 02:06:04,873
Yeah, me too. I heard that.
She and that Dr. Drew...

1313
02:06:04,949 --> 02:06:07,747
you didn't have to guess
what was going on there.

1314
02:06:07,819 --> 02:06:09,753
Ya ask me...

1315
02:06:09,821 --> 02:06:12,221
you go to live with
a bloodthirsty maniac...

1316
02:06:12,290 --> 02:06:15,054
you're just asking for it.

1317
02:06:15,126 --> 02:06:17,686
She went on a real rampage.

1318
02:06:17,762 --> 02:06:21,789
I'll bet they'll never pin it on her,
just like back before.

1319
02:06:21,866 --> 02:06:25,529
Martha! Dora!
Ooh, whee, is this a day.

1320
02:06:25,603 --> 02:06:29,198
People dropping like flies
every which way.

1321
02:06:29,274 --> 02:06:31,401
What happened?

1322
02:06:31,476 --> 02:06:36,504
- Well, what, Nellie?
- You won't never in this world believe it, but it's so.

1323
02:06:36,581 --> 02:06:40,915
Jewel Mayhew... And I know
because I got it straight from Bessie...

1324
02:06:40,985 --> 02:06:42,919
- What? What?
- What happened?

1325
02:06:42,987 --> 02:06:47,014
- Jewel Mayhew just went
and dropped dead this morning.
- Oh, no.

1326
02:06:47,091 --> 02:06:49,685
She had her third stroke
and she was gone...

1327
02:06:49,761 --> 02:06:52,093
before they even got
the doctor on the phone.

1328
02:06:52,163 --> 02:06:55,724
- No!
- And just guess what brought it on.

1329
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:57,392
- What?
- What?

1330
02:06:57,469 --> 02:07:01,269
It was when she heard what happened
over here last night.

1331
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:25,596
Isn't that the most
extraordinary thing?

1332
02:07:25,663 --> 02:07:27,358
What is?

1333
02:07:27,432 --> 02:07:31,163
It was just a thought.
But suppose it was Jewel Mayhew...

1334
02:07:31,236 --> 02:07:35,969
who really murdered
her husband back in '27.

1335
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:38,975
And supposing there was
a witness to the murder.

1336
02:07:39,043 --> 02:07:41,102
So?

1337
02:07:41,179 --> 02:07:44,273
That would explain why
she didn't try to collect...

1338
02:07:44,349 --> 02:07:46,613
on her husband's insurance.

1339
02:07:46,684 --> 02:07:51,485
She was afraid a routine investigation
might reveal her guilt...

1340
02:07:51,556 --> 02:07:53,524
thus enabling the witness...

1341
02:07:53,591 --> 02:07:56,583
<i>to take advantage ofher silence</i>
<i>and blackmail her...</i>

1342
02:07:57,862 --> 02:07:59,989
bleeding her white.

1343
02:08:01,165 --> 02:08:03,099
What does that give you?

1344
02:08:03,167 --> 02:08:06,364
Well, it would at least give us...

1345
02:08:06,437 --> 02:08:10,305
the timing ofJewel Mayhew's death and...

1346
02:08:10,375 --> 02:08:15,642
all this sort of bizarre irony,
wouldn't it?

1347
02:08:15,713 --> 02:08:17,806
Hey, you're not kidding, are you?

1348
02:08:17,882 --> 02:08:21,841
It would mean that Charlotte Hollis
has suffered all her life...

1349
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:24,115
for a murder
she hadn't committed.

1350
02:08:24,188 --> 02:08:28,784
- You mean that's true?
- How should I know, old chap?

1351
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:30,794
I'm just guessing.

1352
02:08:30,862 --> 02:08:33,695
Merely speculating, that's all.

1353
02:08:36,868 --> 02:08:39,132
<i>Here she comes now.</i>

1354
02:08:45,043 --> 02:08:48,774
- <i> It's Charlotte Hollis.</i>
- Look. There she goes.

1355
02:09:30,822 --> 02:09:34,553
- Here she comes.
- Hey, Miss Hollis, over here.

1356
02:09:37,261 --> 02:09:39,559
Now give me another one.

1357
02:09:40,732 --> 02:09:43,030
Thank you, Miss Hollis.

1358
02:09:45,303 --> 02:09:47,897
Can I have one too, Miss Hollis?

1359
02:09:50,908 --> 02:09:53,672
<i>She looks right pretty, don't she?</i>

1360
02:09:56,113 --> 02:09:59,708
Sometimes they got their sane moments,
just like you or me.

1361
02:09:59,783 --> 02:10:02,650
<i>Maybe so, but you ain't seen Dr. Drew...</i>

1362
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:05,518
<i>or that Deering woman lying in there.</i>

1363
02:10:05,589 --> 02:10:08,353
<i>Oh, she has to be crazy as a loon.</i>

1364
02:10:19,970 --> 02:10:22,530
- I wouldn't wanna be in her shoes.
- Y'all step back.

1365
02:10:22,606 --> 02:10:24,540
All right,
let's move back, everybody.

1366
02:10:24,608 --> 02:10:27,634
Miss Hollis, this letter's for you.

1367
02:10:27,711 --> 02:10:31,147
I think you've been waiting
a long time for it.

1368
02:10:34,318 --> 02:10:36,718
Sorry. Everybody has to move back.

1369
02:11:11,822 --> 02:11:14,552
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

1370
02:11:17,761 --> 02:11:20,525
<i>Step back.</i>

1371
02:11:20,597 --> 02:11:23,191
- Stop pushing!
- Get back over there!

1372
02:11:51,628 --> 02:11:54,791
<i>Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte</i>

1373
02:11:56,266 --> 02:12:00,032
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

1374
02:12:01,271 --> 02:12:06,368
<i>Hush, hush</i>
<i>sweet Charlotte</i>

1375
02:12:06,443 --> 02:12:11,210
<i>I'll love you till I die</i>

1376
02:12:12,850 --> 02:12:16,251
<i>Hush, hush</i>
<i>sweet Charlotte</i>

1377
02:12:18,188 --> 02:12:22,249
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

1378
02:12:23,894 --> 02:12:28,388
<i>Hush, hush</i>
<i>sweet Charlotte</i>

1379
02:12:28,465 --> 02:12:30,592
<i>I'll love you</i>

1380
02:12:30,667 --> 02:12:36,071
<i>Till I die</i>
