Fuck

Weapon.

13
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:04,801
Sleep well sir.

14
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,209
It's time, Freya.

15
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,043
I told you before, Father

16
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:59,274
the answer is no!.

17
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,076
Wulfric will be a good man!

18
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:04,945
With you by his side
maybe a good king!

19
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,846
He'll be just like his father
a tyrant and a butcher.

20
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,540
I won't marry him!

21
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:21,779
Then you better choose someone else.

22
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,077
Because when he's king
it'll be too late to say no.

23
00:10:24,218 --> 00:10:26,615
Then don't make him king!

24
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:34,847
Let me look at that.

25
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:35,643
It's fine.

26
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,273
Let me see it!

27
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:49,982
I'm not getting any younger, Freya.

28
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:53,918
I just want to make sure that
you're well looked after

29
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,683
when I'm gone.

30
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:59,279
I know, Father. I know.

31
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,680
And

32
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:03,880
if any one can make
Wulfric keep the peace,

33
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:07,683
by the gods, it's you.

34
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:19,346
I rule Herot and Freya rules me.

35
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:23,075
I don't think so.

36
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:26,914
And no queen of mine
will fight like a man.

37
00:11:33,987 --> 00:11:35,816
I will take care of you.

38
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:41,313
She's like her mother.

39
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:45,681
You'd do well to tread
more softly with her.

40
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,450
There's nothing soft about her.

41
00:11:51,455 --> 00:11:52,852
Gunnar's village was sacked.

42
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:55,681
What happened?.

43
00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:58,110
I don't know.

44
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:00,050
There were no bodies, nothing.

45
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,517
Slavers?.

46
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,484
Too much blood.

47
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:08,087
What about Gunnar?.

48
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:10,288
He's still trading with the Rus.

49
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:12,217
He'll be back before the snow.

50
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,416
He'll think it was us.

51
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:18,411
It should've been.

52
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:20,019
Was it?.

53
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:26,381
No.

54
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:28,784
We caught a man
nearby in the woods.

55
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:30,352
One of ours?.

56
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:35,781
Well, what tribe was he?
Frankish, Rus?.

57
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:38,856
I don't know. But I'll find out.

58
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:40,645
Well, do it quickly.

59
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:44,883
It's war if you don't.

60
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:58,349
I'll take those.

61
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:15,848
Bring him

62
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:23,479
So who are you, Outlander?.

63
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:26,217
I'd answer him, friend.

64
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:27,555
Your name!

65
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:33,522
My name is Kainan.

66
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:36,386
Kainan?. What kind of name is that?.

67
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,013
Where are you from?.

68
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,316
An Island to the north.

69
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,049
Why did you attack Gunnar's village?.

70
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:44,351
I didn't attack anyone.

71
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:45,582
Then why were you there?.

72
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:46,623
I was hunting.

73
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,554
Hunting?.

74
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:48,715
Hunting what?.

75
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,154
That.

76
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,117
A dragon

77
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,916
Tell me! Why where you there?.

78
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,320
Where are your men?.

79
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,391
Told you.

80
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:09,991
Don't lie to me.

81
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:14,290
Stick with the dragons. I like that one.

82
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:17,386
All right.

83
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:18,992
I'll tell you.

84
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:26,084
I was hunting...dragons.

85
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:42,284
Not yet

86
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:24,855
The prisoner's hurt.

87
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,489
So are you, by the looks of it.

88
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,852
And he needs looking after

89
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,757
I've got work to do.
You clean up your own mess.

90
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:42,325
To hell with it then.

91
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:45,519
He dies, it's on your head.

92
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:50,755
Bjorn!

93
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:52,859
He needs looking after

94
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:59,562
Let me pass.

95
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,690
That's enough! Get out!

96
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,156
What did he tell you?.

97
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:51,728
Nothing.

98
00:17:52,102 --> 00:17:53,931
Some lies about a dragon.

99
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:57,698
But he's hiding something.

100
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:00,899
Keep at him.

101
00:18:01,802 --> 00:18:03,597
I have to send riders to find Gunnar.

102
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:06,099
He has to know that it wasn't us.

103
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:08,792
He'll never believe us.
Not when he sees his village.

104
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:11,626
We should kill him while
we still have the chance.

105
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:13,799
Like your father would have done.

106
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,161
And he would have been right.

107
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,427
My father's dead because of Gunnar.

108
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,160
Your father's dead
because he was a fool!

109
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,460
You want to kill Gunnar.

110
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:36,596
I can understand that.

111
00:18:37,436 --> 00:18:39,129
And you want to rule from here.

112
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:41,235
I can understand that, too.

113
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:47,198
But it's not your sword that
will make you king, nor Shield Hall.

114
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,329
It's how you rule your own
head and heart.

115
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:59,827
Until you understand that
then you'll never wear this.

116
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:27,563
Water.

117
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:30,864
Please.

118
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,029
Thank you.

119
00:19:55,873 --> 00:19:57,304
Did you do what they're saying?.

120
00:19:57,973 --> 00:19:59,871
Did you attack Gunnar's village?.

121
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:03,199
No.

122
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:18,504
Bjorn!

123
00:20:58,374 --> 00:20:59,532
It's sharp.

124
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:02,430
It's never sharp enough.

125
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:03,431
If Gunnar comes tonight...

126
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:06,768
If Gunnar comes tonight he'll stick
that blade right up your arse.

127
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,774
... then you'll wish it wasn't so sharp.

128
00:21:30,176 --> 00:21:31,368
You smell that?.

129
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:42,271
Arn?.

130
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,503
The sentries are gone!

131
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:29,201
It's Gunnar! Get to the walls!

132
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,872
Where are they?.!

133
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:47,773
Is it raiders?.

134
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:49,571
Give me my blade, woman!

135
00:22:58,113 --> 00:22:58,976
They're inside the walls.

136
00:22:59,113 --> 00:23:00,510
Take your men, fan out!

137
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,202
The rest with me!

138
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:41,043
Gunnar!

139
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:08,773
Moorwen!

140
00:25:32,318 --> 00:25:33,147
He's getting away!

141
00:25:33,285 --> 00:25:34,511
Get him out of here!

142
00:25:35,852 --> 00:25:36,818
Where is Gunnar?.

143
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,178
I don't know!

144
00:25:49,853 --> 00:25:52,080
What could have done this?.

145
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:01,949
Right, get up.
It was the demon, Mimir.

146
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,022
Come to drag us down to Jotunheim

147
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:05,918
and freeze us dead.

148
00:28:06,057 --> 00:28:08,818
Enough of your forest spirits, Unferth.

149
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:12,916
It was Frankish raiders. Sure enough!

150
00:28:14,691 --> 00:28:15,520
They climbed over the walls.

151
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:16,986
Then what, Boromir?.

152
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,091
We all saw Bjorn's body.

153
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:19,622
He was clawed to death.

154
00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:21,519
It was an animal.
No!

155
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:23,384
This is the work of Lucifer!

156
00:28:23,524 --> 00:28:27,081
Visited upon us because you
buried King Halga like a pagan...

157
00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:28,281
and not like a Christian!

158
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:29,481
My father was a Viking.

159
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,886
He worshiped Odin not some
woodworker nailed to a cross.

160
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:35,556
And I'll be damned if it was
anything but a bear!

161
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:47,682
First Gunnar, now us.

162
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:52,251
Three of my men are missing
five are dead.

163
00:28:53,493 --> 00:28:55,391
May Odin keep them.

164
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:08,721
So why don't you tell me
about your dragon?.

165
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:13,056
My people call it a Moorwen.

166
00:29:14,093 --> 00:29:15,388
A Moorwen?.

167
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,523
I've never even heard of such a thing.

168
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,018
Believe me.

169
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,386
The first time I saw one,

170
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,516
I didn't know what I was looking at.

171
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,982
It was just a smudge of
light in the darkness.

172
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,550
It could have been anything.

173
00:29:32,794 --> 00:29:36,226
That's how it draws
its prey in, with light.

174
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,390
Foxfire.

175
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:43,650
It kills men, beasts, everything.

176
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,887
And it smells like death.

177
00:29:47,428 --> 00:29:48,586
There's nothing like that here.

178
00:29:48,727 --> 00:29:50,454
Yes, there is.

179
00:29:51,595 --> 00:29:53,288
Because I brought it here.

180
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,387
Silence!

181
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:00,057
Leave him!

182
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:02,687
Come here!

183
00:30:09,428 --> 00:30:12,053
You say you're responsible for this.

184
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:13,490
Yes.

185
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:15,917
It got on my ship, it killed my crew.

186
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:17,652
Then we crashed here.

187
00:30:18,095 --> 00:30:20,061
I know you don't believe me...

188
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:23,558
but this thing has carved out
a territory and you are in it.

189
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:34,386
You think you can frighten us
with children's stories.

190
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:36,358
This is no story.

191
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:39,994
But whatever you think did this,

192
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,453
you're going to hunt it down
aren't you?.

193
00:30:46,796 --> 00:30:48,227
Take me with you.

194
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:54,156
How am I supposed to
fight it like this?.

195
00:30:54,296 --> 00:30:55,659
You're not.

196
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,793
That one's yours.

197
00:30:59,864 --> 00:31:00,988
What do I do with it?.

198
00:31:01,131 --> 00:31:02,494
Hey! What do I with it?.

199
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,993
Outlander.

200
00:31:14,764 --> 00:31:17,229
Enough! Mount up.

201
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,362
How's your jaw?

202
00:31:59,465 --> 00:32:00,657
Your jaw!

203
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,225
Freya?.

204
00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:06,656
Here. Try some of this.

205
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:11,497
Cure anything from a sword
in the guts to a broken heart.

206
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,021
You shouldn't feel too bad.

207
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,959
You see that?.

208
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:19,564
She once stuck me with a fork

209
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,163
It seems I got a little too
familiar when I was in me cups.

210
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:26,628
Well, go on! Drink!

211
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:36,059
Good, eh?.

212
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,790
What is it?.

213
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:40,159
What is it!

214
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,198
What kind of backwater are you from?.

215
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:43,822
Some place far from here.

216
00:32:43,968 --> 00:32:44,865
For certain.

217
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:48,990
Far off and sad that's
not tasted Herot mead.

218
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,725
Boromir likes his drink

219
00:32:58,168 --> 00:32:59,895
You know, Outlander...

220
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:03,995
we trade in every direction
for a thousand miles.

221
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:09,463
South, east and west, not north.

222
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:12,334
There's nothing there.

223
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:14,057
Maybe you haven't
looked far enough.

224
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,791
Perhaps.

225
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:20,826
But what's a man who lives so far
north doing in these seas?.

226
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:23,162
We have an outpost near here.

227
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:27,461
And that's where this Moorwen
got on board your ship?.

228
00:33:31,503 --> 00:33:32,593
Yes.

229
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:35,499
And what it did to your village
it did to mine.

230
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:39,263
We were taking the bodies
back for a burial.

231
00:33:39,736 --> 00:33:41,894
That's when it must
have gotten onboard.

232
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,028
Hold up!

233
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,826
Bear came this way.

234
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,636
There's been a lot of
animals through here since.

235
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,459
We should split up
try to find the main trail.

236
00:34:09,604 --> 00:34:11,160
That's a bad idea.

237
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,958
We should stay together.

238
00:34:15,104 --> 00:34:16,433
We'll pair up.

239
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,002
Wulfric, you take the Outlander.

240
00:36:29,742 --> 00:36:31,230
A bear wouldn't do this.

241
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,070
It's here.

242
00:37:06,943 --> 00:37:08,568
Wulfric! Wait!

243
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:06,036
Now that's a bear.

244
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:17,638
Outlander!

245
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:23,608
Take this sword.

246
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:25,873
And your life, too.

247
00:38:27,147 --> 00:38:28,578
It's yours again.

248
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:48,779
Wulfric! Wulfric!

249
00:39:40,049 --> 00:39:42,708
Kainan!

250
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:47,304
Kainan! Kainan!

251
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:02,949
Sit here!

252
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,173
Be my guest tonight.

253
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,509
Daughter! Kainan needs some drink

254
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,414
See, now you look like a Viking.

255
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,981
Doesn't he, Freya?.

256
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:22,447
Perhaps.

257
00:40:26,117 --> 00:40:28,605
Nobody cooks this better
than my kitchen.

258
00:40:29,451 --> 00:40:30,916
Eat!

259
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:36,409
There I was, running into
the cave ahead of everyone...

260
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:39,913
when suddenly, out of nowhere
came the biggest...

261
00:40:40,051 --> 00:40:44,574
most vicious bear I've ever seen.

262
00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:47,081
He tore up two grown men...

263
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:49,740
and was about to eat
the king himself...

264
00:40:49,885 --> 00:40:52,680
when the Outlander stuck
his sword in it.

265
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:56,576
You see, the bear was there.

266
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:59,048
No! There!

267
00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:03,617
And Rothgar was... Rothgar was here.

268
00:41:04,153 --> 00:41:06,948
What's this?.

269
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:13,478
Creeping into Shield Hall uninvited.

270
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:14,642
Off you go!

271
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:15,944
Wait!

272
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:17,711
What's your name?.

273
00:41:19,386 --> 00:41:21,011
Answer him, lad.

274
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:26,243
Here. Are you hungry?.

275
00:41:33,787 --> 00:41:37,549
He wants to see the sword
that killed the bear.

276
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:47,312
No.

277
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:50,880
I'll trade you for your name.

278
00:41:57,187 --> 00:41:58,584
Eric.

279
00:42:00,054 --> 00:42:01,485
Eric.

280
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,984
A sword for a name.

281
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:16,947
Just bring it back in one piece.

282
00:42:20,255 --> 00:42:22,948
His parents were killed
by raiders a year ago.

283
00:42:25,688 --> 00:42:27,051
The boy will be fine.

284
00:42:27,688 --> 00:42:29,677
We take care of our own.

285
00:42:32,555 --> 00:42:36,112
Shields!

286
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:41,220
Shields!

287
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:43,650
Shields! it is.

288
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:51,720
Shield! Shield! Shield!

289
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,148
You!

290
00:43:17,557 --> 00:43:18,488
Kainan!

291
00:43:18,624 --> 00:43:19,953
You.

292
00:43:20,091 --> 00:43:28,183
Kainan! Kainan! Kainan!

293
00:43:42,057 --> 00:43:43,181
Up!

294
00:43:49,691 --> 00:43:52,384
Kainan! Kainan!

295
00:44:01,492 --> 00:44:02,582
What now?.

296
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:04,055
Follow me.

297
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:00,892
The Outlander's good.

298
00:45:01,027 --> 00:45:03,584
Care to wager some gold on him?.

299
00:45:04,461 --> 00:45:06,790
No one beats Wulfric at shields.

300
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:21,253
Kainan!

301
00:45:38,129 --> 00:45:39,355
Now you try this.

302
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,522
Oh hell.

303
00:45:58,996 --> 00:46:00,586
Are you ready for this, Boromir?.

304
00:46:11,596 --> 00:46:12,720
I am now.

305
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:15,627
Okay.

306
00:46:54,498 --> 00:46:55,724
Not bad.

307
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,092
Sorry.

308
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,162
Outlander, I wanted...

309
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,560
Kainan.

310
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,165
My name is Kainan.

311
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,030
Kainan,

312
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,657
I wanted to thank you for
bringing my father back to me.

313
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:04,630
For saving his life.

314
00:48:08,734 --> 00:48:12,826
It happened so fast
I did it without thinking.

315
00:48:13,735 --> 00:48:15,200
Like when you hit me?.

316
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:17,290
Hit you?.

317
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:21,194
Yes, sorry about that.

318
00:48:21,601 --> 00:48:22,998
We're even now.

319
00:48:35,035 --> 00:48:36,694
All the women are talking about you.

320
00:48:39,269 --> 00:48:43,065
They say you're from a place
far beyond the ice.

321
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:47,792
I heard one say from
the home of the gods.

322
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:50,757
What do you think?.

323
00:48:52,435 --> 00:48:54,060
I think..

324
00:48:55,203 --> 00:48:57,192
she was a little drunk

325
00:49:03,903 --> 00:49:05,368
Freya!

326
00:49:06,503 --> 00:49:09,162
Everyone thinks that
bear killed your people.

327
00:49:10,003 --> 00:49:11,332
It didn't.

328
00:49:12,004 --> 00:49:14,265
It was the Moorwen and
it will come back

329
00:49:30,204 --> 00:49:31,294
Get the others!

330
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,264
It's Gunnar!

331
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:23,298
Get out of here!

332
00:50:23,906 --> 00:50:25,235
Get out of here!

333
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:28,568
Get out of here!

334
00:51:15,074 --> 00:51:16,664
Rothgar!

335
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:47,499
It's over. We've lost!

336
00:51:47,643 --> 00:51:48,733
No!

337
00:51:50,442 --> 00:51:51,237
Let me go!

338
00:51:51,376 --> 00:51:52,898
Get your hands off me!

339
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:55,702
Rothgar!

340
00:51:59,643 --> 00:52:01,767
The gate. Close the gate!

341
00:52:09,643 --> 00:52:11,006
Rothgar!

342
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:15,370
Where are you
you bastard son of a bitch?.

343
00:52:20,343 --> 00:52:21,706
Where's my wife?.

344
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,169
Where's my boy?.

345
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,870
You didn't even leave me their bodies.

346
00:52:34,178 --> 00:52:36,541
If it takes a thousand years

347
00:52:37,977 --> 00:52:41,841
I'll carve your heart out
of your rotting chest.

348
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,638
Do you hear me?.

349
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,668
This is the man you want
to make peace with?.

350
00:54:31,781 --> 00:54:33,110
Are you all right?.

351
00:54:34,715 --> 00:54:35,873
I'm fine.

352
00:54:39,482 --> 00:54:40,640
That looks deep.

353
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:43,341
Here let me clean it.

354
00:54:54,982 --> 00:54:56,277
What happened out there?.

355
00:54:56,682 --> 00:54:58,011
Who was that?.

356
00:54:58,216 --> 00:54:59,340
That was Gunnar.

357
00:54:59,749 --> 00:55:01,146
Gunnar?.

358
00:55:01,483 --> 00:55:04,278
King Halga, Wulfric's father...

359
00:55:04,883 --> 00:55:07,849
called all the tribes together
for a raid on the Franks.

360
00:55:08,149 --> 00:55:09,637
Gunnar never showed.

361
00:55:09,783 --> 00:55:12,305
There was an ambush and
Halga was killed.

362
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,247
So Wulfric thinks
Gunnar betrayed him.

363
00:55:17,783 --> 00:55:21,044
And Gunnar thinks his village
was destroyed in revenge.

364
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:23,881
That's right.

365
00:55:24,883 --> 00:55:27,212
Wulfric is simple like his father.

366
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:31,307
He'll send a party into
the trees just before dawn.

367
00:55:31,883 --> 00:55:34,440
And then attack from the main
gate first light.

368
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:41,983
But I think he's in for a surprise.

369
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:23,741
Gunnar said wait here.

370
00:57:06,654 --> 00:57:07,642
Aethril?.

371
00:57:13,754 --> 00:57:15,981
Circle up. Circle up!

372
00:57:20,822 --> 00:57:22,980
Get Wulfric and Rothgar up here now!

373
00:57:28,922 --> 00:57:30,046
What's going on?.

374
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:35,618
Wulfric!

375
00:57:47,322 --> 00:57:48,753
Wait! Don't shoot!

376
00:57:48,888 --> 00:57:50,945
Hold your fire. We surrender.

377
00:57:51,088 --> 00:57:52,280
It's a trick

378
00:57:52,522 --> 00:57:54,078
Archers!

379
00:57:56,689 --> 00:57:57,881
Ready!

380
00:58:02,856 --> 00:58:03,844
Fire!

381
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:05,181
Wait!

382
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:10,587
Hold your fire, you bastards!

383
00:58:10,722 --> 00:58:11,812
Wait!

384
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,047
No!

385
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,350
Open the gates!

386
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:34,186
Wulfric! No!

387
00:58:35,124 --> 00:58:36,384
Look!

388
00:58:59,325 --> 00:59:02,620
Now that is not a bear.

389
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:11,119
It was like hitting a stone wall.

390
00:59:11,258 --> 00:59:12,314
I hit it with all I had.

391
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:14,253
Ran. Just like you ran from my father.

392
00:59:14,392 --> 00:59:16,255
I'll cut your tongue out, boy.
Stop!

393
00:59:16,392 --> 00:59:17,721
Both of you.

394
00:59:17,859 --> 00:59:20,017
That thing is still out there!

395
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:21,522
The gods have cursed us all.

396
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:23,181
We should leave this place while
we can still save our families.

397
00:59:23,325 --> 00:59:24,188
This is our home!

398
00:59:24,326 --> 00:59:26,189
We are not going to let
that thing chase us out!

399
00:59:26,326 --> 00:59:27,552
She's right! We're not leaving.

400
00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:30,249
We're going to hunt this thing
down and kill it like Vikings.

401
00:59:30,393 --> 00:59:31,949
Hunting won't work

402
00:59:36,426 --> 00:59:38,153
You can't take it on in the open.

403
00:59:38,293 --> 00:59:39,156
It's too powerful.

404
00:59:39,293 --> 00:59:40,553
Well, what else is there?.

405
00:59:40,693 --> 00:59:42,124
We trap it.

406
00:59:44,027 --> 00:59:45,993
Even if you do track it down,

407
00:59:46,226 --> 00:59:47,953
How are you going to kill it?.

408
00:59:48,259 --> 00:59:50,451
Why are we even listening to him?.
He's not one of us.

409
00:59:50,593 --> 00:59:51,990
That's right. I'm not.

410
00:59:52,127 --> 00:59:53,786
But you're wrong about this, Wulfric.

411
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:56,620
Like you were wrong about and the bear.

412
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,817
And you'll always be wrong until
you stop thinking with this.

413
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,853
This is finished!

414
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,520
You're not one of us.

415
01:00:06,661 --> 01:00:08,559
The decision is ours.

416
01:00:08,794 --> 01:00:12,351
However, I'm still your king.

417
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,087
And my judgment is that
the Outlander is correct.

418
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:22,620
We build the trap.

419
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:31,754
So,

420
01:00:33,128 --> 01:00:34,753
where do we start?.

421
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:37,159
Here...

422
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:44,485
And ending... here.

423
01:00:53,262 --> 01:00:54,989
What are you waiting for?.

424
01:00:55,663 --> 01:00:56,821
Dig!

425
01:01:14,729 --> 01:01:17,092
The forge, what does it burn?.

426
01:01:18,497 --> 01:01:19,723
Wood.

427
01:01:19,896 --> 01:01:22,293
What about the torches, the lamps?.

428
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:23,895
Whale oil.

429
01:01:24,297 --> 01:01:25,523
I'll need it.

430
01:01:26,096 --> 01:01:26,720
How much?.

431
01:01:26,863 --> 01:01:28,158
All of it.

432
01:01:51,665 --> 01:01:52,857
How's it coming?.

433
01:01:55,264 --> 01:01:56,991
Is it deep enough for you?.

434
01:01:57,231 --> 01:01:58,060
No.

435
01:01:58,198 --> 01:01:59,527
Four more feet.

436
01:02:00,031 --> 01:02:01,360
And when you got that...

437
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:04,225
I need two rows of postholes
running up both sides.

438
01:02:04,431 --> 01:02:05,487
Post holes?.

439
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:05,994
Yeah.

440
01:02:06,132 --> 01:02:08,359
What do you need post holes for?.

441
01:02:08,598 --> 01:02:09,893
Posts.

442
01:02:10,132 --> 01:02:11,222
Posts.

443
01:02:13,432 --> 01:02:14,363
Posts.

444
01:02:41,866 --> 01:02:43,024
Are we done now?.

445
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:44,222
Not yet.

446
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:46,797
Not yet?. What's left?.

447
01:02:48,567 --> 01:02:49,657
Shields?.

448
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,095
Shields.

449
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:51,500
When this thing is over...

450
01:03:53,036 --> 01:03:54,865
...there's a place here for you.

451
01:03:56,569 --> 01:03:57,864
Should you wish it.

452
01:04:52,205 --> 01:04:53,431
You hungry?.

453
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:14,168
What about you?.

454
01:05:16,338 --> 01:05:17,735
I'll eat when you're finished.

455
01:05:17,939 --> 01:05:19,029
No.

456
01:05:19,338 --> 01:05:20,564
You sit.

457
01:05:24,705 --> 01:05:25,965
Thank you.

458
01:05:38,439 --> 01:05:40,302
I saw you talking to my father today.

459
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:45,499
What did he say?.

460
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:49,269
He asked me to stay.

461
01:05:52,806 --> 01:05:53,829
What did you say?.

462
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,828
Freya...

463
01:06:07,407 --> 01:06:09,531
You don't even know
what kind of man I am.

464
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,764
I know enough.

465
01:06:13,141 --> 01:06:14,504
No, you don't.

466
01:06:19,807 --> 01:06:21,204
So, tell me.

467
01:06:27,974 --> 01:06:29,439
Kainan?.

468
01:06:33,474 --> 01:06:35,666
My people are no different than yours.

469
01:06:38,108 --> 01:06:39,368
Hungry for land.

470
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:42,900
So when we found
an island we wanted,

471
01:06:44,842 --> 01:06:45,865
we took it.

472
01:06:57,142 --> 01:07:01,234
It didn't matter that it already
belonged to something else...

473
01:07:03,576 --> 01:07:07,099
Moorwens. Millions of them.

474
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,267
But we wanted it.

475
01:07:12,276 --> 01:07:15,174
After all, we told ourselves
they were nothing.

476
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:18,833
Just animals. Beasts.

477
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:29,770
So we killed them all with fire.

478
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:50,976
Those we missed, we hunted down.

479
01:08:38,513 --> 01:08:40,671
You obeyed your king's orders.

480
01:08:41,012 --> 01:08:42,238
You didn't have a choice.

481
01:08:42,379 --> 01:08:44,106
You always have a choice.

482
01:08:49,213 --> 01:08:52,872
Land that belonged to the Moorwens
now belonged to us.

483
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,973
As part of my pay I was given a place
for my family to live.

484
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:13,344
And I thought I could forget
what I'd done to get it.

485
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,672
Some things you can't
bury deep enough.

486
01:09:18,514 --> 01:09:20,412
Hey! What are you doing?.

487
01:09:20,547 --> 01:09:22,944
That plant, it stung me.
It what?.

488
01:09:23,081 --> 01:09:24,876
It stung me.

489
01:09:25,347 --> 01:09:28,471
Let me show you something.
Stay right here, okay?.

490
01:09:53,149 --> 01:09:54,307
Kainan.

491
01:09:55,849 --> 01:09:57,109
The guns are up.

492
01:09:57,316 --> 01:09:59,145
And there are none of them left.

493
01:09:59,882 --> 01:10:01,472
You'll be safe.

494
01:10:08,115 --> 01:10:08,773
I love you.

495
01:10:08,915 --> 01:10:10,380
I love you, too.

496
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:45,211
Three weeks later I got word that
one of the Moorwens had survived.

497
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:49,882
And it got in our compound
and killed everyone.

498
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:55,579
It was the will of the gods.

499
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:56,478
It was their destiny.

500
01:10:56,617 --> 01:10:58,139
There is no destiny.

501
01:10:59,151 --> 01:11:00,946
There is no gods.

502
01:11:05,084 --> 01:11:06,344
It was just me.

503
01:11:09,117 --> 01:11:10,412
And I failed them.

504
01:11:14,018 --> 01:11:15,313
I failed them.

505
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:32,580
This is a king's sword,

506
01:11:33,652 --> 01:11:35,641
passed down from my ancestors.

507
01:11:37,019 --> 01:11:38,245
My father gave it to me...

508
01:11:38,385 --> 01:11:40,078
and told me that one day

509
01:11:40,285 --> 01:11:42,342
I would know the man to give it to.

510
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,549
A good man.

511
01:11:58,153 --> 01:12:01,880
If you truly believe that you
write the tale of your own life...

512
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,350
...then the end is up to you.

513
01:12:39,454 --> 01:12:40,646
More arrows!

514
01:12:53,622 --> 01:12:55,087
The gods be with you.

515
01:13:05,455 --> 01:13:07,148
Boromir, close the doors.

516
01:13:20,389 --> 01:13:21,820
Open the gates!

517
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:39,385
You sure this will work?.

518
01:13:45,324 --> 01:13:46,550
That's what I thought.

519
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:53,417
Hold this.

520
01:15:15,393 --> 01:15:16,517
Gods above...

521
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:32,889
Wait for my order!

522
01:15:58,628 --> 01:16:00,321
What's your damn priest doing?.

523
01:16:27,662 --> 01:16:30,492
I command thee, Lucifer,

524
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:32,323
quit this place!

525
01:16:58,297 --> 01:16:59,592
Ready!

526
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:17,129
Wulfric!

527
01:17:18,965 --> 01:17:20,157
Hold your fire!

528
01:17:22,098 --> 01:17:22,529
Shoot!

529
01:17:22,664 --> 01:17:23,322
Take my hand!

530
01:17:23,465 --> 01:17:24,021
Shoot!

531
01:17:24,165 --> 01:17:26,562
Hold!
Take it now!

532
01:17:30,165 --> 01:17:31,323
Fire!

533
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:45,356
By the gods!

534
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:19,633
Freya?.

535
01:18:23,434 --> 01:18:24,365
Freya!

536
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:26,858
Freya!

537
01:19:32,736 --> 01:19:34,133
Moorwen!

538
01:20:03,104 --> 01:20:04,070
Kainan

539
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:06,095
There's another one!

540
01:21:23,074 --> 01:21:24,232
Kainan!

541
01:21:26,474 --> 01:21:27,666
everyone's leaving.

542
01:21:33,641 --> 01:21:37,232
Eric, it's not safe here anymore.

543
01:21:37,808 --> 01:21:39,774
Everyone's going to the boats.

544
01:21:40,507 --> 01:21:42,063
You need to go, too.

545
01:21:42,407 --> 01:21:44,396
But, I want to stay here with you.

546
01:21:45,641 --> 01:21:47,300
You'll come back soon.

547
01:21:47,507 --> 01:21:48,870
Everyone will.

548
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:50,571
You promise?.

549
01:21:58,675 --> 01:21:59,867
I promise.

550
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:38,674
Your boots, do you want them back?.

551
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:43,269
No. They're his now.

552
01:22:45,776 --> 01:22:46,900
What are you going to do?.

553
01:22:47,877 --> 01:22:49,103
You're king now.

554
01:22:51,344 --> 01:22:52,707
King of what?. This?.

555
01:22:53,977 --> 01:22:57,000
This... and them...

556
01:22:59,043 --> 01:23:00,838
Whatever Herot becomes tomorrow...

557
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:03,433
will be because of
what you do right now.

558
01:23:06,078 --> 01:23:07,600
Let's go kill this thing...

559
01:23:10,744 --> 01:23:12,039
... together.

560
01:23:36,879 --> 01:23:38,071
You're daft!

561
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:40,178
We're not going down there.

562
01:23:40,312 --> 01:23:41,868
That's where it came from.

563
01:23:42,012 --> 01:23:43,375
That's where we're going.

564
01:23:43,812 --> 01:23:45,835
But we don't know how to kill it yet.

565
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:47,035
We need better weapons.

566
01:23:47,179 --> 01:23:50,202
No. We need better metal.

567
01:23:51,045 --> 01:23:52,943
Boromir, get the forge ready.

568
01:23:53,412 --> 01:23:57,003
Unferth, Olaf, get the torches
and the ropes.

569
01:23:57,479 --> 01:23:58,535
Let's go.

570
01:23:59,613 --> 01:24:01,044
I'm coming with you.

571
01:24:04,379 --> 01:24:05,639
No you're not.

572
01:24:06,813 --> 01:24:10,506
That thing killed my father and
destroyed my home.

573
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:12,134
I'm coming with you.

574
01:24:20,046 --> 01:24:21,636
This is where your ship went down?.

575
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,545
That's right.

576
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,975
In a lake?.

577
01:24:35,348 --> 01:24:36,245
Don't ask

578
01:25:33,616 --> 01:25:34,582
Kainan?.

579
01:26:05,384 --> 01:26:06,542
Freya?.

580
01:26:07,451 --> 01:26:08,882
Freya?.

581
01:26:15,351 --> 01:26:16,441
Where's Freya?.

582
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,877
Just get the metal and make the swords!

583
01:26:23,285 --> 01:26:24,341
Damn.

584
01:26:34,818 --> 01:26:36,340
What kind of metal is this?.

585
01:26:52,152 --> 01:26:53,617
King's sword again.

586
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:26,645
You're...
I know. Daft.

587
01:28:55,523 --> 01:28:56,511
Let's go.

588
01:31:26,196 --> 01:31:27,491
Where's it coming from?.

589
01:31:31,662 --> 01:31:33,059
It's beneath us.

590
01:31:59,397 --> 01:32:00,453
God.

591
01:32:01,497 --> 01:32:02,792
I slipped.

592
01:32:20,331 --> 01:32:21,455
Let's keep moving.

593
01:32:31,531 --> 01:32:32,928
Ain't nothing down there.

594
01:32:42,231 --> 01:32:44,129
Unferth!
Wulfric!

595
01:32:49,399 --> 01:32:50,694
Can you see anything?.

596
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:53,163
Over here!

597
01:34:20,935 --> 01:34:21,923
Boromir!

598
01:34:47,703 --> 01:34:49,861
We'll drink together again, Kainan.

599
01:34:52,670 --> 01:34:53,930
Herot mead.

600
01:34:56,737 --> 01:34:58,134
Best in the world.

601
01:35:13,437 --> 01:35:15,369
No!

602
01:35:17,671 --> 01:35:19,193
Kainan!

603
01:35:20,104 --> 01:35:22,661
Freya! Freya...!

604
01:35:23,738 --> 01:35:26,101
Kainan!

605
01:35:30,838 --> 01:35:31,996
That way!

606
01:35:32,971 --> 01:35:35,368
Freya!

607
01:35:36,938 --> 01:35:37,994
I'm here.

608
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,665
Freya, Freya.

609
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:34,030
Freya!

610
01:36:41,973 --> 01:36:43,666
Freya. Squeeze through!

611
01:36:44,774 --> 01:36:45,330
Squeeze through!

612
01:36:45,474 --> 01:36:46,632
Too tight.

613
01:36:47,674 --> 01:36:49,299
Take it!

614
01:37:08,675 --> 01:37:12,266
Freya, calm down, calm down.

615
01:37:18,209 --> 01:37:20,072
By all the gods.

616
01:37:44,676 --> 01:37:45,642
Move!

617
01:38:18,311 --> 01:38:19,435
Over there!

618
01:38:33,978 --> 01:38:35,341
Get her out of here!

619
01:38:42,311 --> 01:38:43,401
Come on!

620
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:55,268
Swing me!

621
01:39:20,546 --> 01:39:21,569
Wulfric!

622
01:43:17,388 --> 01:43:18,648
Is it dead?.

623
01:43:21,355 --> 01:43:22,411
Yes.

624
01:43:33,289 --> 01:43:36,584
I wanted this for so long.

625
01:43:41,222 --> 01:43:43,245
At least I got to wear it for a day.

626
01:43:48,189 --> 01:43:50,552
I hope you wear it for
longer than I did.

627
01:43:53,822 --> 01:43:55,412
We could have been friends.

628
01:43:56,156 --> 01:43:57,815
We are friends.

629
01:44:42,925 --> 01:44:44,788
Eric.

630
01:44:45,058 --> 01:44:46,046
Up here!

631
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:48,256
Up here!

632
01:44:49,425 --> 01:44:50,391
Up here!

633
01:44:50,525 --> 01:44:51,990
Up here!

634
01:45:08,259 --> 01:45:09,622
You wait here for the others.

635
01:45:11,159 --> 01:45:12,715
I've got something to do.

636
01:45:14,692 --> 01:45:16,351
You're not coming back are you?.

637
01:49:22,135 --> 01:49:24,692
In the year of Four Kings,

638
01:49:25,068 --> 01:49:28,830
Rothgar and Wulfric were laid to rest.

639
01:49:29,268 --> 01:49:32,063
Heroes in the war against the Moorwens.

640
01:49:47,503 --> 01:49:52,265
And Kainan, once a stranger to us...

641
01:49:52,802 --> 01:49:54,427
... became king.

642
01:49:56,969 --> 01:50:00,093
He took for himself a wife... and a boy,

643
01:50:00,236 --> 01:50:02,599
who became as his own son.

644
01:50:38,171 --> 01:50:40,398
But only I knew his secret.

645
01:50:42,138 --> 01:50:44,501
That the gods had sent us Kainan.

646
01:50:47,305 --> 01:50:49,827
And when it came time
to return to them...

647
01:50:51,905 --> 01:50:55,496
...he chose to stay with us instead.

648
01:50:59,185 --> 01:51:02,185
