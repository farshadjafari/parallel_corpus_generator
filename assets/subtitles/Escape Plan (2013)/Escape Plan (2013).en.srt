What the fuck do you care?
You got a date?

32
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:43,113
No.

33
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:45,451
Maybe, you've got a sister or cousin.

34
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:48,961
You got your head smashed?

35
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:50,161
No, i'm groovy.

I got everybody.
I got everybody.

51
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,838
- What the fuck is going on?
- We got fire at B2.

52
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,249
- All prisoners, back to their cell.
- Copy that.

53
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:24,011
What the fuck?

54
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,211
We got a runner.
I repeat..

55
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:26,574
Prisoner is Ray.

56
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,596
Nice ride.

57
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:54,795
Hushe's idea.

58
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:56,571
That's right.

59
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:57,771
How's this side, Bossman.

60
00:07:57,971 --> 00:08:00,346
This side's great.
I warden was about you.

61
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:03,644
You know, If you wasn't out soon.
I would've break in,

62
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:04,845
that motherfucker pullingl your ass out.

63
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:06,045
The only ex-con i know,
who gets out and wants to go back in.

64
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:09,639
I didn't say, <i>wants</i>.

65
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,839
I said, I would.

66
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,454
There's a difference.

67
00:08:35,678 --> 00:08:36,801
Don't spend it all on one place.

68
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,892
<i>We have an escape from
Bendwater Penitentiary.</i>

69
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:10,083
Step out from the booth,
with your hands in the air!

70
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,283
Showtime.

71
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,884
Put your hands in the air, now.

72
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:18,375
Hands in the air.

73
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:21,601
Put your hands behind your head,
lock your fingers.

74
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:22,802
Do not move.

75
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,075
A beautiful day.

76
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,008
- What the hell is going on her?
- Calm down, Warden.

77
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:57,207
I am Lester Clark.

78
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:01,671
I am C.E.O of the CEE Security.

79
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,870
You may have heard of us?

80
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:04,071
No?

81
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,376
Alright, well..we are an independent
security company.

82
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:13,360
Hired by the
federal bureau prison.

83
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:16,090
To test the integrity of their,

84
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:20,168
maximum security, facilities.
Nation wide.

85
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:24,403
This is Ray Breslin,
He is partner..and uh..

86
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:27,230
Resident Houdini.

87
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:28,429
Warden.

88
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:33,477
Now, for the last seven years.
Ray has been inserted into every

89
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:34,677
maximum incarceration facility.

90
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,149
In the system.

91
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,638
He is there to ensure that
each and every one of them is 100 %

92
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:42,837
escape proof.

93
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:47,615
And apprently, yours wasn't.

94
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:48,815
And he got out.

95
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:50,014
Ta dah!

96
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,599
Okay, fine.

97
00:10:56,126 --> 00:10:58,640
I suppose, you're gonna tell me
how you did it?

98
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:01,976
You think he wants to know?
Doesn't seem like it.

99
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:06,566
Ray, you are on.

100
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:08,298
Warden, let's start from the top.

101
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,379
Any break requires, three things.

102
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,879
Knowing the lay out,
Understanding the routine and

103
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,379
help from outsiders the realm.

104
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:18,879
If you know the lay out,
the weak side is obvious.

105
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,347
In Bendwaters case...
is the secure housing unit.

106
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,740
With the government expenditure with
17 Million dollars, building the facility.

107
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,940
State of the art.

108
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:30,534
The only problem is...

109
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,485
It's located next to
unsecure fire crash.

110
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,414
First, I needed to get inside,

111
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,615
so, i made some enemies.

112
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,952
Once inside, it was obvious
you are short staff.

113
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,929
Federal guidelines recommend
two guards present when

114
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,155
transfering high risk inmates.

115
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:52,355
You only use, one.

116
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:55,245
Knowing the guard's routine
was the next step.

117
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:59,086
30 seconds into my rec. Time
my C.O took a smoke break.

118
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:02,748
7 minutes of everyday
there were no eyes on me.

119
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:04,695
<i>Two, three..</i>

120
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:10,615
After i knew the routine.
All i had to do, was pick a date.

121
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:14,826
And arrange for a distraction
at the front gate at exactly 4 p.m.

122
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,027
But still at this point,
you're locked inside a steell box

123
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:19,707
to get out,
you had to have a key code.

124
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:23,376
You very good chocolate milk.

125
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,825
See, the carton container has
a thin layer of wax linen.

126
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:39,320
Lay it over the keypad to impress
within the key, with four keys to impress.

127
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,436
With the four keys, its just numbers
game to indentify the correct sequence.

128
00:12:55,635 --> 00:12:58,053
I just needed to get to the keypad.

129
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:19,784
After, i had to cover my tracks,

130
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:22,210
I had one minute to
make to the fire response shift.

131
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,259
Before the team did.

132
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,393
I know the guards were still on the roof,
doing what they do.

133
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:38,592
Which is wasting time.

134
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:46,620
Before you know it,
I am right where i wanna be.

135
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,419
Just in time,
to catch my ride.

136
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:10,610
And your men drove me
right off the grounds.

137
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:11,965
You have any questions?

138
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,684
Yeah, one.

139
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:22,501
What kind of man would choose to spend
most of his life in prison?

140
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,821
Don't take it personally, Warden.

141
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:30,703
Over the years, Ray has broken out
of 14 like this institutions.

142
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,966
Some people has a talent to paint.
Some, uh..to sing.

143
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,167
Me? I sing.

144
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:41,211
Ray Bresler, He posesses a unique
set of skills. He is able break out..

145
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,988
Of any prison designed by man.

146
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:47,087
I take it, you have been good?

147
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:49,587
Yeah. You?
You a good boy inside?

148
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:53,065
Well, of course.
Okay..

149
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:55,006
How did that thing with that guy go?

150
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,206
- What guy?
- What guy.

151
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:57,407
When i was gone, you were
angry about that there's some guy

152
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:03,414
Some bozo?
- Oh, yeah. That bozo ended before dessert.

153
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:08,029
- That's his loss.
- Yeah, they are all lizards.

154
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,818
How many times have i told you that?

155
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,827
You want to get something to eat,
while we get by?

156
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:17,565
Is there a problem?

157
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:21,811
You're a horrible cook.

158
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,554
That's nice. Well...

159
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:25,754
You can complain in the morning.

160
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:32,019
Ouch!

161
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,220
Good morning, sir.
How can i help you?

162
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,769
Oh, Mr.Breslin.
I'm so sorry. I am Jules.

163
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:45,969
That's okay.

164
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:47,168
You're new here?

165
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:49,711
No, Sir. I've been here 5 months.

166
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:50,912
- 5 months?
- Yes, sir.

167
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,903
What have you got for me?

168
00:15:57,102 --> 00:15:58,102
Check it out.

169
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:02,440
That is good.

170
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,940
Very smart.
Did you do this all by yourself?

171
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:07,440
I'm impressed.
Genious..

172
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:10,475
You are smart but..

173
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:14,488
Sorry. Not smart enough.

174
00:16:16,304 --> 00:16:18,496
Don't be bitter.

175
00:16:41,924 --> 00:16:45,345
Morning, guys.

176
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:48,573

Your work is the gold standard in field.

178
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:54,049
What you've accomplished is remarkable.

179
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:55,529
<i>(Mimes)</i>- remarkable.

180
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,099
Thank you,
and..you are here because?

181
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,599
She is 'Agency', Ray.
As in..

182
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,908
Central Intelligence Agency.

183
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:05,827
- You, a spy?
- Worse..I am a lawyer.

184
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,430
Ray, hear her out.

185
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,849
She's legit.

186
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,579
I called into Langley, myself.

187
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,650
Fine, I'll just listen.
Go ahead.

188
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:20,345
Mr.Breslin..after ending extra ordinary
renditions, the agency is looking

189
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,730
for alternate situations for incarcerating
this sort of people who commit acts

190
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:25,714
so despicable, they are best..
Well...

191
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,365
how can i put it..
- Eliminated?

192
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:30,566
'Disappeared'.

193
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,660
We are currently testing a prototype

194
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:36,211
to deal with people,
no government wants on their books.

195
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:37,411
But first and formost..

196
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:41,197
The people financing this, need to
know these facilities are escape proof.

197
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:43,776
Before, the whole systems go online,
globally.

198
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:47,493
Which is really saying is that, none of this
is officially sanctioned by anyone.

199
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:51,479
Close. What i'm saying Ms.Rose..
Is that these facilities

200
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,096
are privately funded and administered.

201
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:56,338
So, the word 'official' doesn't really apply.

202
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:59,680
So, if anything goes wrong,
nothing comes back to bite you people in the ass?

203
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Whoa, whoa..this is not

204
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,589
..your concern.
- Hey! I owe him.

205
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,440
I don't owe you.

206
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,617
My job is to make sure that
the united states is in safe hand.

207
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:11,502
Alright, can we just cut the crap
and call it like it is?

208
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:13,929
These institutions are off the grid.
With no trials,

209
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,429
there's no convictions;
this people just disappears

210
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,640
and you want him,
to go in and test it?

211
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,148
Maybe it's time for me to interject
to the conversation that

212
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,483
they have offered,
double your standard fee.

213
00:18:25,683 --> 00:18:28,096
That's five mils..Ray.
In advance.

214
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:29,296
So, you like this?

215
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:31,865
Look.. I'm the numbers guy.
You are the artist, Ray.

216
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:35,309
And from the financial stand point,
I like it. I like this very much.

217
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,579
Beyond the money, Mr.Breslin.

218
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:42,549
The people send to this place shouldn't
be allowed out into the real world.

219
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,730
Everyone of them is potential
game changer. For the worst.

220
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,299
Alright.

221
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,788
- Guidelines?
- The usual full works.

222
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:58,288
Alias, cover story..contacts.
Evect number.

223
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:00,788
Well, the only differece is
to fully test the security

224
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:03,884
of the system; It's essential that
non of you know

225
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:05,971
the location of the incarceration.

226
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:09,380
- Will that present a problem?
- Yes. Yes, it would.

227
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:21,137
When do we start?

228
00:19:21,337 --> 00:19:22,337
You just did.

229
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:26,378
Your entered new identity..

230
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,878
Would be picked up from this location.

231
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,775
By private contractors
24 hours from now.

232
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:51,940
I don't like this.

233
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,140
And, you don't like her.

234
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:55,105
Man, don't flatter yourself.

235
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,348
We are going against every
protocol and guidelines

236
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:02,422
that you, yourself has insisted on
every single time that you go in.

237
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,329
- And, I don't like her.
- You're right.

238
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:06,451
She doesn't like anything.

239
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:07,652
Because she's ambitious and greedy.

240
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:10,414
You say that like its a bad thing.

241
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,200

242
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,413

Yeah, you do.
This is not Old school.

253
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:50,028
You think, i'm gonna let you go in, cold?

254
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:51,229
This gets old.

255
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:56,424
- Man, you're fucked up.
- Try it sometime.

256
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,305
Sounds good, bossman.
Anytime you wanna retire, you know

257
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,173
I've been taking notes.
I'm ready to step up.

258
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:03,736
Where am i gonna find another techno thug
who's as good as you are here?

259
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:06,098
- A freak of nature.
- Yeah, very rare.

260
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:10,579
There you are baby,

261
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,140
transponder is good.

262
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,898
It's like having me around
in your shoulder.

263
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:17,098
What elese?

264
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,182
Hey, don't forget to write us, alright?

265
00:22:34,197 --> 00:22:35,306
Shit.

266
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,365
Time to sleep.

267
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,549
Prisoner, 17458

268
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:30,329
Puertos..welcome.

269
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,119
To the international detainment, intake.

270
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,259
I am Warden Hobbes.

271
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,059
Where is Warden Marsh?

272
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:41,529
There is no Warden Marsh.

273
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,640
What am I, disoriented..excited?

274
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,729
I guess, that must be it.

275
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,798
And i didn't see a man killed on
a transport helicopter

276
00:26:55,998 --> 00:26:56,998
thrown out of it, right?

277
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,867
Mr.Portos, your intake is finished.

278
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:07,067
Wait?

279
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,299

No,

284
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,589
i don't think so.

285
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:31,833
You come in here, now
you belong to me.

286
00:27:32,032 --> 00:27:36,039
Your intake is finished.

287
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:39,483
Wait..Wait.
Come here, back.

288
00:27:39,484 --> 00:27:43,194
- Anything?
- I'm getting cold response, same as yesterday.

289
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,142
You ran a full dinostic on the system?

290
00:27:46,342 --> 00:27:49,684
- Twice.
- Run it again.

291
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,390
<font color=#D53109>P.A -</font> <i>All prisoners in A Block
proceed to dock 5.</i>

292
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:59,999
<i>All prisoners in A Block
proceed to dock 5.</i>

293
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:17,400
Portos?

294
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,039
Hey,?

295
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:34,525
Go make some friends,
You gonna need them.

296
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:32,284
Damn!

297
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:36,230
Damn!

298
00:31:02,575 --> 00:31:05,530
New fish..we own you.

299
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:10,530
Back Off!

300
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,105
Last time..?

301
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,984
Back away.

302
00:31:21,654 --> 00:31:24,410
Poertos?

303
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:33,674
Rothmayar.. Emil Rothmayar.

304
00:31:35,214 --> 00:31:36,750
I'm really not in hand shaking mood,
right now.

305
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:40,849
Okay...

306
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,324
Your name..
The fourth mousketeer.

307
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,818
It's a good name.

308
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,244
Why are you in here?

309
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,448
Why do you care?

310
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:58,199
I used to run security for
a guy..

311
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,150
By the name of Mannheim.

312
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,058
Have you heard of the name?

313
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,259
Mannheim..let me see?

314
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,880
No.

315
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,079
- He is a genius.
- Really?

316
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,933
He has this habit of taking money from
the rich and giving it to the poor.

317
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:18,257
- You've heard that story before..
- I've heard the story, yeah.

318
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:21,273
Now, they're trying to find him.

319
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:24,374
But, i'm not gonna help them.

320
00:32:24,574 --> 00:32:25,574
Okay.

321
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:26,773
So, fuck 'em.

322
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:27,973
Right, fuck 'em.

323
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:32,440
Poertos,

324
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,548
- don't get killed.
- If you say so.

325
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:37,749
Last time they killed a guy in here..

326
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,724
They let his body
rot for three days.

327
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,134
Oh..and cancel the prison dance.

328
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,347
Wouldn't want to fuck up the prom.

329
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:01,799
Morning, sir.

330
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,049
That's another beautiful piece, sir.

331
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,050
You lied to me.

332
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,250
I lied to you?

333
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,451
- I'm not sure...
- No..no.

334
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:20,079
You say nothing.

335
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,169
What am i suppose to tell the client
about the man you killed.

336
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:26,943
That he just jumped?

337
00:33:27,144 --> 00:33:28,144
Like you said?

338
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:31,002
This isn't a free for all.

339
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:33,871
We are paid to prevent
him from jumping.

340
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:37,565
And i can't get proof of life,
from a dead man.

341
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,765
So..

342
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,378
You will be dock the entire price
of the asset.

343
00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:45,659
The entire price of the asset

344
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,690
it goes on my months of my pain.

345
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,819
Then, you're lucky this man you killed
wasn't high value.

346
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,001
That is all, Gerry.

347
00:34:32,998 --> 00:34:34,170
Hey, Portos..

348
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:36,585
Look at this.

349
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,239
There is no sunrise or sunset,

350
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:42,184
still, they pray all the time.

351
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:45,369
Don't you find that interesting?

352
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:46,806
Not really.

353
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:50,293
You look like, the kind of a guy
that find this interesting.

354
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,010
That kind, before?

355
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:57,331
Why all the questions?

356
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:58,532
It's how i learn things.

357
00:34:58,731 --> 00:34:59,731
You really ought to study
somebody else.

358
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:06,085
- Portos?
- What?

359
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:07,286
You need a favour?

360
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,250
Favour man.

361
00:35:38,478 --> 00:35:41,931
Compromising Correctional Institution
Security - <i>Ray Breslin</i>.

362
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:52,728
Well, for a man who is not interested.

363
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:54,780
You are doing a lot of looking.

364
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,634
What do you need?

365
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:05,077
I need to get into the isolation area.

366
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:07,519
No, you really don't.

367
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:10,518
Yeah, i really do.

368
00:36:10,717 --> 00:36:13,021
Call it..a favour.

369
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:15,769
Okay?

370
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,440
Okay.

371
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:28,750
That's your favour?

372
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:30,389
This one's gonna straight us good.

373
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,849
Really?

374
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,650
Come on.

375
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:36,150
Let's see what you can do.

376
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:38,070
Alright.

377
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,757
You hit like a vegetarian.

378
00:36:44,956 --> 00:36:46,972
- Really?
- You can do better than that.

379
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:51,400
Come on.

380
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,409
- Let me see it.
- Try this.

381
00:36:58,186 --> 00:36:59,409
You hurt?

382
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,909
- That's good.
- The good one's coming.

383
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,833
Relax..let's pretend.

384
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,639
I guess, boys will be boys.

385
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:18,079
<i>That's enough.</i>

386
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,599
<i>Bring them in the barn now.</i>

387
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,536
You can thank me later.

388
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,617
Think.

389
00:38:04,817 --> 00:38:07,114
Think.

390
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:22,523
They knew, he was tagged.

391
00:38:22,722 --> 00:38:23,722
Of course, they knew.

392
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:24,922
Who do you think, this guys are?

393
00:38:25,123 --> 00:38:26,123
Who do you think?
They are a bunch of...

394
00:38:26,322 --> 00:38:28,518
Yahoos..from one of those
BOP facilities?

395
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,719
This is the shadows world.

396
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:32,449
These guys, they invented
this shit.

397
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,360
Why do you think
they are paying us all that money?

398
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,210
Remember, what the guidelines were.

399
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,820
What the fuck are you talking about?

400
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,829
There are no guidelines.
You call that CIA bitch.

401
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,030
Hush?

402
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:47,449
Motherfucker.

403
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,809
Alright..

404
00:38:52,469 --> 00:38:53,650
I'll make the call.

405
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,599
Abigail, you gotta keep him..

406
00:38:57,798 --> 00:38:58,798
Away from me. Alright?

407
00:39:15,204 --> 00:39:17,050
Give me your arm.

408
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:48,369
You will live.

409
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,884
How do a doctor work,
in a place like this?

410
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,019
Would you prefer,
there wasn't a doctor here?

411
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:56,588
Where is here?

412
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:01,355
Hey Doc, let's wrap it up.

413
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:23,960
What did he asked you?

414
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:28,110
He wanted to know his..

415
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,719
Dehydration is; compared to the others.

416
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:34,744
And what did ya tell him?

417
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:35,945
I don't care.

418
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:39,907
That's what I told him.

419
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:48,224
Get him out of there!

420
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:06,519
Did you find what you're looking for,
In the box?

421
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:13,840
<i>All prisoners back to your cell.</i>

422
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,869
<i>All prisoners back to your cell.</i>

423
00:41:30,637 --> 00:41:33,186
Who were you before you
came in here, Portos?

424
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,657
You are always, watching the room..
Always watching everything.

425
00:41:38,858 --> 00:41:39,858
Are you asking me,
what i used to do?

426
00:41:40,057 --> 00:41:41,057
Yeah.

427
00:41:41,257 --> 00:41:42,257
I'll tell you.

428
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,458
But i need a another favour.

429
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,510
Fuck that.

430
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,710
Alright, don't do it.

431
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:49,289
Alright, i'm listening.

432
00:41:50,222 --> 00:41:51,663
What's the favour, this time?

433
00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:52,862
I need a piece of metal.

434
00:41:53,063 --> 00:41:54,063
About 3 inches wide..

435
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,034
Round, smooth.

436
00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:58,380
Oh, no problem.

437
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,514
--
I'll be right back, okay?

438
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:05,454
If you get me that piece of metal,
I might be able to get you.

439
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:07,498
Out of here.

440
00:42:15,592 --> 00:42:19,019
Tell Hobbes, i want to talk.

441
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,969
You've been six months now, Mr.Rothmayar.

442
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,806
So, you know how this works.

443
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:36,090
10 seconds.

444
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,840
Where is Victor Manheim?

445
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:43,170
You know to my people,

446
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:46,331
- He is a hero.
- 9 seconds.

447
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:48,449
Do you have a pencil and
a piece of paper?

448
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:49,648
8 seconds.

449
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:51,545
I could draw you a map.

450
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,695
- Of what?
- Where you could find him.

451
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:07,210
You know when i was a kid..

452
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:08,849
I always wanted to be an artist.

453
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,099
My god, you're pushing it.

454
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:12,989
The problem was..

455
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,699
I had no talent.

456
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,139
- 6 seconds.
- I tried.

457
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:19,969
- And i tried and tried.
- 5..

458
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,780
- Do you have dreams?
- 4...

459
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,980
Did you always wanted to be..

460
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:27,952
- This?
- 2..1!

461
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:29,152
Done.

462
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,458
There.

463
00:43:38,072 --> 00:43:39,304
I told you.

464
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,920
No talent.

465
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:47,030
Records indicate that you are
highly intelligent, huh?

466
00:43:47,409 --> 00:43:48,349
Yeah.

467
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,367
As such, I'd have expected you
to see the situation,

468
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:52,567
and understand it for what it is.

469
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:56,735
In here, you have no control
over any part of your life.

470
00:43:56,936 --> 00:43:57,936
Except, your breathing.

471
00:43:59,764 --> 00:44:01,748
And you just lost that privelege.

472
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:02,949
Get him down.

473
00:44:38,505 --> 00:44:39,864
Keep going.

474
00:44:45,476 --> 00:44:47,219
Enough.

475
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:32,394
- What happened?
- Nothing.

476
00:45:32,594 --> 00:45:33,594
I am still here.

477
00:45:37,597 --> 00:45:39,507
Now, it's your turn.

478
00:45:42,315 --> 00:45:44,793
I break out of prisons,
for a living.

479
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:47,766
For the past 8 years, I've been breaking
out of facilities

480
00:45:47,965 --> 00:45:48,965
for the federal bereau of prisons.

481
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,420
I think, Hobbes been hired
for this place to make it unbreakable.

482
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,630
Someone wanted this place tested.

483
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:58,753
But it was a set up.

484
00:45:58,952 --> 00:46:01,028
They wanted to bury me.
I don't kow who.

485
00:46:01,228 --> 00:46:02,228
But i'm gonna find out.

486
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,425
I need you to set up
another diversion.

487
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,059
What now?

488
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:10,070
You gotta go back,
in the box.

489
00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:11,269
No fucking way.

490
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,793
Wanna get out of here?

491
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:20,630
Okay. I'll do it.

492
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,157
But if i don't get out...

493
00:46:23,356 --> 00:46:25,467
I'll kill you.

494
00:46:25,668 --> 00:46:26,679
Fair enough.

495
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:30,139
The success for a break out
depends on three things.

496
00:46:30,139 --> 00:46:34,085
- Layout, routine and..help.
- What if this thing isn't build that way?

497
00:46:34,284 --> 00:46:35,284
It's not.

498
00:46:35,574 --> 00:46:36,795
Something under the box,
i think it's a cover.

499
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:42,260
If it is,
how do we know where it goes?

500
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:50,085
Anyway, I'm gonna find out.

501
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:54,989
- Eat.
- It's disgusting.

502
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:57,489
The mind of an inmate works
differently than someone on the outside.

503
00:46:57,489 --> 00:46:59,989
He sees things differently.

504
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:02,489
The architecture is vertical.

505
00:47:03,074 --> 00:47:05,706
The cell blocks, the outer locks..
The box, the mess...

506
00:47:05,905 --> 00:47:08,699
everything is in large vertical compartment.

507
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,391
The best guess is they build down underground,

508
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:16,023
In large natural fixtures.
Like caves.

509
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:21,813
If i can get in there.

510
00:47:22,012 --> 00:47:24,724
Follow where it goes,
i just might find out a way to the surface.

511
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,478
If you are right,
How do you dug a metal?

512
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,050
It don't cut, don't cut at all.

513
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,250
This place is sub-terrenial.

514
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:34,449
There's moisture in the air.

515
00:47:35,664 --> 00:47:37,420
Whoever build this place,
should've used aluminium.

516
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:40,340
Which means, the whole panelling
is done with steel.

517
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:41,664
Steel rust over time.

518
00:47:44,668 --> 00:47:47,809
The way around that is concentrating
the heat to boost through this.

519
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,929
This will panel with snap right
the fuck off.

520
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,811
- Concentrated heat?
- Yeah. With the piece of metal you gave me.

521
00:47:55,012 --> 00:47:58,168
We exposed it with the toothpaste
polished to rinse the metal.

522
00:47:58,367 --> 00:48:00,025
- To some heat.
- With the lamps at the box.

523
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:01,224
Right.

524
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:05,085
At a 100 degree centigrate steel
on those panel with 3 cubic centimeter

525
00:48:05,286 --> 00:48:06,286
those bolt will come right off.

526
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:09,885
What?

527
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:12,059
- You don't look so smart.
- You don't either.

528
00:48:13,443 --> 00:48:15,836
See most prison are locked
to small towns.

529
00:48:16,036 --> 00:48:17,036
With an hour or more,

530
00:48:17,237 --> 00:48:19,623
we need supplies and workforce.

531
00:48:19,822 --> 00:48:23,041
Now, if i get to the surface,
I don't who can take me over the wall.

532
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,208
But first, I'm gonna need that
diversion in the box.

533
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,780
How much time do you need then?

534
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,980
3 to 5 minutes.

535
00:48:35,782 --> 00:48:37,201
No problem.

536
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,679
- Step back.
- I know you.

537
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,277
You don't know shit.
You can't see that.

538
00:49:07,476 --> 00:49:09,693
Now, step back.

539
00:49:10,436 --> 00:49:11,744
I know half of your brother.

540
00:49:11,943 --> 00:49:12,943
Right.

541
00:49:13,637 --> 00:49:16,771
Your mother,
she was my favourite whore in marrakech.

542
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:19,400
Man, she could polish that horn..

543
00:50:54,903 --> 00:50:56,010
Damn!

544
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,409
You're killing me!

545
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:21,135
You're killing me!

546
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:32,014
What is he onto?

547
00:51:39,675 --> 00:51:42,039
Hey, shut the fuck up.
You german dog!

548
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:59,659
Just hold him till i get there.

549
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,088
Hey, i got a camera
malfunction in box 2.

550
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:05,288
<i>Roger that.
Just reboot the system.</i>

551
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,168
Shit!

552
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:31,827
Should we restrain and drug him, sir?

553
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:33,027
Not yet.

554
00:52:55,644 --> 00:52:58,210
Lights off, box 4.

555
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:11,994
A rough day, Mr.Rothmayar?

556
00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:23,063
Here's what you should know.

557
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:27,219
I don't care, sooner or later
you will tell me what i want to know.

558
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,420
It's inevitable.

559
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:29,619
Like dying.

560
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:33,132
Know this,
there will come a point;

561
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:35,679
where i don't give a shit about you..

562
00:55:36,324 --> 00:55:39,434
Or whatever the fuck
you think you are doing right now.

563
00:55:39,634 --> 00:55:42,469
So, have a lovely day, Mr.Rothmayar.

564
00:56:23,715 --> 00:56:25,978
Report.
Valve breach on level two sir.

565
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:27,179
Electrical malfunction.

566
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:37,007
Sir?

567
00:57:24,965 --> 00:57:26,213
- Did you make it?
- Yeah.

568
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:27,413
Where are we?

569
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:30,550
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

570
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:33,603
They froze the check.

571
00:57:33,804 --> 00:57:34,804
What are we talking about here?

572
00:57:35,003 --> 00:57:37,324
The payment for Ray's services.
They froze the check.

573
00:57:39,681 --> 00:57:41,106
Not frozen, it's on hold.

574
00:57:41,306 --> 00:57:42,306
Alright, it's very common.

575
00:57:42,507 --> 00:57:44,563
- On 2.5 Million dollar transaction.
- No..no, no.

576
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:46,958
Common would be a week,
maybe 10 days.

577
00:57:47,157 --> 00:57:49,237
- This has been way longer than that.
- Listen Abbey.

578
00:57:49,438 --> 00:57:50,438
It's the federal government.

579
00:57:52,329 --> 00:57:54,829
You know how they work.

580
00:57:54,829 --> 00:57:57,385
- Did you call that woman?
- Yeah, I called. Everything's fine.

581
00:57:57,585 --> 00:57:58,585
Then, where is he?

582
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:02,715
He is on the job,
That he was hired to do.

583
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:03,916
So, you're saying
it's all good?

584
00:58:08,603 --> 00:58:09,474
It's all good.

585
00:58:09,675 --> 00:58:10,675
Where was the breach?

586
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:16,889
The auxiliary balance system sank outside.
Premise 5 and 7 has been compromised.

587
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:20,974
Navigation ventilation is shocked on box 2.

588
00:58:23,179 --> 00:58:25,130
Portos?

589
00:58:37,065 --> 00:58:38,599
Layer is full of rust.

590
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,800
Water pressure must've
snapped em clean off.

591
00:58:42,715 --> 00:58:43,835
Maybe.

592
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:53,110
Portos isn't his name, is it?

593
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:54,309
Why wasn't i alerted?

594
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:59,132
Our client's been paying lots of money
to make sure that facility is unbreakable.

595
00:59:02,429 --> 00:59:04,929
Now, he is there to proove that,
not even he

596
00:59:04,929 --> 00:59:07,429
can get out. Now you make sure
he's there forever.

597
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:09,461
Do you have a problem with that?

598
00:59:09,661 --> 00:59:10,661
No. No, not at all.

599
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,469
Just the opposite.

600
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:14,670
<i>Fucker.</i>

601
00:59:16,106 --> 00:59:17,289
There's one more thing.

602
00:59:17,489 --> 00:59:18,489
The chinese bank..

603
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:23,000
Have joined the Brazillians, the russians
the english and the u.s

604
00:59:23,949 --> 00:59:27,050
and the swiss banks they're all paying
to find about the whereabout of

605
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,483
this man Heimler fellow.

606
00:59:29,684 --> 00:59:30,684
Word on the street is that
he's developed

607
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,690
a programme to turn the entire
world banking system

608
00:59:33,889 --> 00:59:36,003
into fucking confederate.

609
00:59:36,202 --> 00:59:38,739
Rothmayar worked with that
asshole, he knows where he is.

610
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:41,365
Your job, is to get that
information out of him.

611
00:59:41,565 --> 00:59:44,440
Well, it just so happens that
since Breslin has got close to Rothmayar,

612
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,481
Rothmayar has developed a new edge,

613
00:59:47,681 --> 00:59:49,777
to his defiance that was not
there before.

614
00:59:49,976 --> 00:59:51,610
I think Breslin is to blame.

615
00:59:52,949 --> 00:59:56,949
- Then, break Breslin.
- Thank you.

616
00:59:58,518 --> 01:00:00,664
I have an assignment
I know you will enjoy.

617
01:00:29,614 --> 01:00:31,317
Get on your feet!

618
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:40,297
Wakey, wakey.

619
01:00:48,469 --> 01:00:49,679
Talk to me.

620
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,980
Come on,
You must fight.

621
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,539
Get up!

622
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:56,739
Stay on your feet.

623
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,389
If we're on a ship.
We would know.

624
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:02,382
No. Not if you're over a
thousand feet long.

625
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:06,235
200 feet high and stabilized
we wouldn't know a damn thing.

626
01:01:07,394 --> 01:01:08,974
Wakey, wakey.

627
01:01:09,175 --> 01:01:10,175
Get him on his feet.

628
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:22,150
You can do it.

629
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:26,675
- You are gonna do it.
- Can't get out of here.

630
01:01:26,876 --> 01:01:27,876
- Yes, we can.
- No!

631
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,398
Get on your feet.

632
01:02:00,985 --> 01:02:02,344
Stop it now, Ray.

633
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,309
Don't give up.
Don't let them break you.

634
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,530
What made you want
to spend your life in prison?

635
01:02:27,849 --> 01:02:30,469
Hmm?
Tell me?

636
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,028
What made you do it?

637
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,110
Tell me!

638
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,389
I was a lawyer,

639
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,929
a prosecutor.

640
01:02:48,929 --> 01:02:52,570
The man that I put away,
made a promise to me.

641
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:56,070
This man thought about this promise
everyday for three years.

642
01:02:56,579 --> 01:02:59,795
Planning his way out of prison.

643
01:02:59,996 --> 01:03:03,065
Planning on how
he's gonna keep his word;

644
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,480
Taking a man's life is nothing.

645
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,639
Taking his heart?

646
01:03:11,269 --> 01:03:13,938
That's everything, Isn't it?

647
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:21,478
Everything.

648
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:33,610
You see, putting people in prison
wasn't good enough.

649
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:35,949
I had to.
I wanted to..

650
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,530
Make sure they stay in there.
Not getting out.

651
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:41,539
I understand.

652
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,559
I have a daughter.

653
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,318
Never forget that.

654
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,818
You have a choice.
You can die in here...

655
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:52,318
or you can get out with me.
Punishing,

656
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,739
who put you here.

657
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:58,030
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

658
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:05,733
Yeah.

659
01:04:05,934 --> 01:04:07,943
Good news and bad news.

660
01:04:08,143 --> 01:04:09,760
I was thinking about
that first meeting.

661
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,960
Privatised Incarceration.

662
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:14,168
Off the grid,
international profile..

663
01:04:14,369 --> 01:04:15,369
And i started digging.

664
01:04:15,568 --> 01:04:16,568
Code name - The Tomb.

665
01:04:16,768 --> 01:04:17,768
Completely for profit.

666
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:21,677
Totally, legal.
Run by ex-military assholes.

667
01:04:21,876 --> 01:04:24,155
Blackwater rejects..
You know bad dudes.

668
01:04:24,355 --> 01:04:26,050
If Ray is anywhere, it's here.

669
01:04:26,251 --> 01:04:27,251
Where is here?

670
01:04:28,179 --> 01:04:31,019
That's the bad news.

671
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:33,889
I don't know.

672
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,420
We need excess to any layout.

673
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:44,940
No blind times.

674
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,130
We are in the middle of
the fucking ocean.

675
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,940
I wouldn't be content
if we didn't find our team.

676
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,036
They've scrambled the guards shift
so they are never the same.

677
01:04:58,235 --> 01:05:02,003
But they can't change the routines
of the guards themselves.

678
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,492
We don't know where they start.

679
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:05,693
We don't know when they end.

680
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,563
But i do know
where they're gonna be..

681
01:05:07,764 --> 01:05:08,764
Based on habit.

682
01:05:09,514 --> 01:05:11,467
See the guy coming down the stairs,

683
01:05:11,668 --> 01:05:12,668
see how he's walks
all pigeon toe?

684
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:15,592
- The duck.
- Yeah, well..

685
01:05:15,793 --> 01:05:19,043
Yeah, the duck always
work with the guy with grey on his neck.

686
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,050
- Hives.
- Yeah, Hives.

687
01:05:22,539 --> 01:05:25,039
When Duck and Hives work together,
they always do it circular.

688
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,539
And they do it,
at random times a day.

689
01:05:27,539 --> 01:05:30,039
It doesn't matter when they do it.
It always end up getting

690
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:32,713
a 120 strides each.
Then, they spit up.

691
01:05:32,914 --> 01:05:33,914
Watch.

692
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:35,878
Now, they each take a side.

693
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:39,786
Duck walks 53 strides,
Hives 65, then they meet up at the top.

694
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,338
The guard down there at the bottom.
That heavy set guy,

695
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,333
He doesn't move much.

696
01:05:45,534 --> 01:05:48,503
My guess is he hasn't been here a while,
and only does what he has to do.

697
01:05:48,702 --> 01:05:51,360
Louisa.

698
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:54,398
- Louisa?
- His standing style reminds

699
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,898
me of my first girlfriend.

700
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,400
Nice.

701
01:05:58,599 --> 01:06:01,739
That guard over there
could create a problem for us.

702
01:06:01,938 --> 01:06:04,119
- He is always looking around.
- The Chicken man.

703
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:06,619
Chicken man, right.

704
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:10,181
My guess, Chick is new here.
Does everything by the book.

705
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,380
How do you know
when the shift ends?

706
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:12,648
I don't.

707
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:16,103
Around this time, your girlfriend
Louisa starts looking at her watch.

708
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:20,849
My guess,
it's lunch time.

709
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:24,106
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

710
01:06:24,306 --> 01:06:26,744
But now that we got the routine,

711
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,943
We just got to ask
the good doctor,

712
01:06:28,143 --> 01:06:29,143
Where the hell we are.

713
01:06:41,193 --> 01:06:43,467
I'm not permitted to give you
anything for the pain.

714
01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:44,668
So, don't request it.

715
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:45,980
Hey, Doc..

716
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,619
You took an oath.

717
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,039
<i>'According to my ability and judgement'</i>

718
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:53,679
<i>'I'll protect my patients from
harm and injustice'.</i>

719
01:07:08,844 --> 01:07:10,903
What exactly is that you
want from me?

720
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:13,425
I wanna know,
where the hell I am.

721
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:35,273
It's okay, it's under control.

722
01:07:35,472 --> 01:07:36,472
Put him back here.

723
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:51,449
Sorry.

724
01:08:03,907 --> 01:08:05,114
- So?
- No luck.

725
01:08:06,655 --> 01:08:07,675
Push him harder.

726
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:08,876
Pushing him is no hopes.

727
01:08:09,076 --> 01:08:10,076
What are the options?

728
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:12,039
Plan-B.

729
01:08:14,378 --> 01:08:16,585
You always gotta have a plan-B.

730
01:08:23,472 --> 01:08:24,865
Did you get it?

731
01:08:35,175 --> 01:08:37,095
Now, I need his glasses.

732
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,270
Sir?

733
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,470
Take a look at this.

734
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,520
It's a makeshift sextant.

735
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:04,326
Will it work this?

736
01:10:04,525 --> 01:10:05,525
It works.

737
01:10:05,725 --> 01:10:06,725
It's? Horizon.

738
01:10:06,926 --> 01:10:09,900
But it will only give us
half of our location.

739
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,655
Bring Breslin.

740
01:10:17,787 --> 01:10:19,081
Ill explain how it works later,

741
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,280
But first, we gotta get this outside.

742
01:10:21,256 --> 01:10:22,904
Watch out there.

743
01:10:37,795 --> 01:10:39,145
Welcome to your new hole,

744
01:10:39,715 --> 01:10:41,233
Mr.Breslin.

745
01:10:42,448 --> 01:10:45,488
Actually, i've been waiting for?

746
01:10:45,689 --> 01:10:46,689
You know who I am?

747
01:10:46,889 --> 01:10:47,889
I do, now.

748
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:52,349
I've studied your work,
very closely.

749
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,849
It's quite brilliant.
As a matter of fact...

750
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,349
It is what i used as reference guide
in designing..

751
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:59,849
This facility.

752
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:01,643
If you know what I am.
Let me go.

753
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:02,842
No, no, no..no. Mr.Breslin,

754
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,654
It's not how this works.
Not this time.

755
01:11:06,854 --> 01:11:09,091
You see, the people who paid
for you to be here;

756
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:10,292
want for you forever.

757
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:13,750
And knowing that,
knowing who you are..

758
01:11:13,949 --> 01:11:17,167
Well, who you were.

759
01:11:18,856 --> 01:11:21,094
I can't have you
communicating with Rothmayar.

760
01:11:21,293 --> 01:11:23,051
Or with anybody else,
for that matter.

761
01:11:23,251 --> 01:11:25,025
This is the reality.

762
01:11:25,225 --> 01:11:27,050
And there is no way out.

763
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,250
This can go, two ways.

764
01:11:28,774 --> 01:11:31,381
You let me go and i'll pretend
this never happened. If you don't..

765
01:11:31,582 --> 01:11:34,293
I'll burn this fucking place
to the ground on my way out.

766
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,475
Effective right now.

767
01:11:37,675 --> 01:11:40,780
No mess, no rec time and

768
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:41,980
no showers.

769
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:46,119
I can get you Victor Mannheim.

770
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,989
Rottmayer trust me.

771
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,414
So, you say.

772
01:11:53,324 --> 01:11:55,289
- Not good enough.
- What've you got to loose?

773
01:11:55,489 --> 01:11:58,667
Finding him can be worth a lot more
than what you're paying for me.

774
01:11:58,868 --> 01:12:00,793
- Right, Hobbes?
- It's a nice idea but...

775
01:12:00,993 --> 01:12:04,872
As it stands right now,
i'm in line to get both.

776
01:12:05,109 --> 01:12:07,609
You will never break Rottmayer.
He'll die before he turns.

777
01:12:09,704 --> 01:12:11,925
I'm the only chance
to get what you want.

778
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:20,225
I want Mannheim and his whole network.

779
01:12:20,426 --> 01:12:22,478
Names, locations in real time.

780
01:12:22,677 --> 01:12:23,677
Get back and if it checks out,
I'll let you go.

781
01:12:23,877 --> 01:12:24,877
But know this..

782
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:28,759
You tell me every word that
you and Rottmayer shares or

783
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:31,417
I will personally pull
the fucking life out of you.

784
01:12:31,617 --> 01:12:32,617
Fair enough.

785
01:12:40,586 --> 01:12:41,869
So, what happened?

786
01:12:42,069 --> 01:12:43,069
I'm playing you.

787
01:12:45,774 --> 01:12:49,067
Last night, Rottmayer tole me he started
his network with 5 guys

788
01:12:49,266 --> 01:12:50,266
in his hometown.

789
01:12:52,025 --> 01:12:54,234
He said, he could trust his life
with this guys.

790
01:12:54,434 --> 01:12:55,434
Give Javed the sextant.

791
01:12:55,634 --> 01:12:56,634
Show him how to use it.

792
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:59,019
And tell him,
it's his ticket out of here.

793
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:00,219
Javed?

794
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,418
He would rather see us dead.

795
01:13:01,755 --> 01:13:03,649
He'll be the last one they suspects.

796
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:08,065
The (?) network caused the bank collapse
in Iceland six years ago.

797
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:10,354
I don't give a shit about
six years ago.

798
01:13:10,555 --> 01:13:12,255
I wanna know where he is now.

799
01:13:31,012 --> 01:13:32,229
You wanna die?

800
01:13:33,694 --> 01:13:34,699
Do you wanna get out?

801
01:13:42,649 --> 01:13:44,189
Today?

802
01:13:46,829 --> 01:13:48,710
- They are planning an escape.
- An escape?

803
01:13:50,109 --> 01:13:52,997
Really? Who and when?

804
01:13:53,197 --> 01:13:54,197
I don't know the details.

805
01:13:56,289 --> 01:13:57,993
Just some.

806
01:13:58,194 --> 01:14:00,025
Tell me the details you know.

807
01:14:02,659 --> 01:14:04,439
You get me fixed first.

808
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:12,905
Mr.Alfredo..Affidi, or whoever the fuck
your name is.

809
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:15,979
Your Opiate drug cartel friends
have paid a lot of money

810
01:14:15,979 --> 01:14:18,899
for you to be here.

811
01:14:19,409 --> 01:14:23,216
Of course, they did.
Those fucks.

812
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:24,416
So, aside from your freedom,

813
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:28,399
what else can i give you?

814
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:31,270
I want the guards
to leave my people alone.

815
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:34,619
The Holy Quran

816
01:14:35,609 --> 01:14:36,819
I want one in my cell.

817
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:39,579
And i want to say
the name of Allah..

818
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,717
And the prophet Mohammad in the open air.

819
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:47,390
I want to be seen by my God.

820
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,149
When i say my evening prayers.

821
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:52,350
That's all?

822
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:56,380
That's all.

823
01:15:01,056 --> 01:15:03,448
I wanna be seen by my God, Mr.Hobbes.

824
01:17:02,261 --> 01:17:03,927
90 degrees 22 minutes.

825
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:07,854
- .....
- North or south?

826
01:17:08,055 --> 01:17:11,670
The water basins turn clockwise,
above the equator, means we're in north.

827
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:12,869
Did we get the longitude?

828
01:17:12,954 --> 01:17:17,605
The batch of fish in yesterday,
he said it's november 20th.

829
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:18,805
Without warm air,

830
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:22,168
or sea, november.

831
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,668
How do you build a secret facility

832
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:27,168
and put it underwater.

833
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:29,695
You have a terrific reason
toward northern latitude.

834
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:30,895
Cos you wanna avoid rough water.

835
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:35,591
So, you're gonna stay away
from the carribean and pacific sea.

836
01:17:35,792 --> 01:17:36,792
And you stick to China sea.

837
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:43,016
If i was a betting man
I'd say it could be off the coast of Morocco.

838
01:17:43,216 --> 01:17:44,994
It's just a guest.

839
01:17:45,194 --> 01:17:50,391
In any case, its close to that sea.
That's my educated guess.

840
01:17:50,591 --> 01:17:54,787
I know a guy there, A Casablanca,
who owes me big time.

841
01:17:54,987 --> 01:17:55,987
Enough to come and get you?

842
01:17:56,329 --> 01:17:58,828
- Huh, he'd still owe me.

843
01:17:58,829 --> 01:18:01,328
Is there a way to get a message out?

844
01:18:03,829 --> 01:18:06,949
My god.

845
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,729
What is this?

846
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:15,640
You swallowed a clotting powder?

847
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:20,829
Listen to me.

848
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,869
I know you think,
I'm playing you.

849
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:26,030
In Hobbes's office,
there is a book.

850
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:29,570
<i>Compromising in Correctional Institution
Security By Ray Breslin,</i>

851
01:18:29,819 --> 01:18:34,090
On page 8 is a detailed description of
cell block C of Lewisberg Federal Prison.

852
01:18:35,979 --> 01:18:38,109
- Guards?
- Check it out.

853
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:41,519
And remember your oath.

854
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:46,519
I can't stall Hobbes anymore.

855
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:49,770
- I gotta give him more location.
- We still doesn't have a plan.

856
01:18:50,789 --> 01:18:52,029
It's in the doctor's hands.

857
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:13,090
<i>The Hippocratic Oath</i>

858
01:19:48,305 --> 01:19:49,427
Guards?

859
01:19:49,627 --> 01:19:53,453
Bring me prisoner Portos.
From A Block.

860
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:59,180
Hobbes's orders,
do it now.

861
01:20:06,738 --> 01:20:08,010
Breathe in.

862
01:20:12,752 --> 01:20:13,899
Okay.

863
01:20:15,854 --> 01:20:17,020
I saw the book.

864
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,220
How did you know?

865
01:20:44,954 --> 01:20:49,564
What do you want me to do?

866
01:20:57,127 --> 01:20:59,935
The doctor is in.
Now, Javed has to do his part.

867
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:12,033
The man you hunt's base of operation
is 20 miles outside Sierra Russo.

868
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:15,528
That's on the Bulgarian-Romania border.

869
01:21:20,449 --> 01:21:22,328
See?

870
01:21:22,528 --> 01:21:26,479
Ratting out a friend ain't so hard.

871
01:21:31,545 --> 01:21:35,998
We got 24 hours, before Hobbes realises
that he Bulgarian location is bullshit.

872
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:41,465
Who do we know in C block?

873
01:21:44,835 --> 01:21:47,054
You've got permission
for your midnight prayer?

874
01:21:47,390 --> 01:21:48,585
So, what do you have for me?

875
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,649
- Lock in Breslin.
- Yes sir.

876
01:22:05,145 --> 01:22:07,600
What are you up to?

877
01:22:11,273 --> 01:22:14,203
Louder...
louder.

878
01:22:14,404 --> 01:22:15,524
Gotcha!

879
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:21,425
Decode it.

880
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:36,307
<i>I need you in 24 hrs 30 degrees 22 (N)
23 degrees 6 (W) 5:00 p.m. sharp tommorrow.</i>

881
01:22:38,961 --> 01:22:43,596
<i>BBQ and pool party.
Don't forget to tell the kids. Bring all toys.</i>

882
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,840
<i>- Rottmayar.</i>

883
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:50,524
Stop it.

884
01:22:54,015 --> 01:22:55,114
Zoom in.

885
01:22:57,929 --> 01:22:59,688
Its McMayer's son.

886
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,176
Breslin is gonna have the sons help
breaking from cell block C.

887
01:23:06,376 --> 01:23:07,515
We have the time frame.

888
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:11,814
And we have a location.

889
01:23:16,729 --> 01:23:17,850
Cell block C.

890
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:20,253
Triple the guard force there.

891
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:21,453
I wanna know everyone
who is involved here.

892
01:23:21,654 --> 01:23:22,654
You will sir.

893
01:23:25,836 --> 01:23:28,012
P.A: <i>Cell block C prepare for inspection.</i>

894
01:23:28,658 --> 01:23:31,189
<i>Cell block C prepare for inspection.</i>

895
01:23:40,274 --> 01:23:42,253
Louisa and Chicken man.

896
01:23:42,453 --> 01:23:43,310
They sent everyone else
to Cell block C.

897
01:23:47,545 --> 01:23:48,600
You better be fucking right.

898
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:51,708
Don't worry.

899
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:56,600
Hey, you fucking white trash
scumbag's bitch!

900
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:59,500
Where's do you think
you're fucking..

901
01:24:00,109 --> 01:24:02,609
- Your fucking sister..
- Fuck you.

902
01:24:05,109 --> 01:24:07,609
Motherfucker!

903
01:24:12,201 --> 01:24:14,463
The riot was suppose to break
from block C.

904
01:24:22,752 --> 01:24:24,429
Move the men from block C
to Babylon.

905
01:24:24,628 --> 01:24:25,628
Right now.

906
01:24:46,309 --> 01:24:47,350
Come on.

907
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:26,859
Where the fuck is Breslin?

908
01:25:28,774 --> 01:25:29,789
Go, go..go.

909
01:25:29,989 --> 01:25:30,989
Let's move.

910
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,990
We got 11 minutes to get to the top
let's hope the doc has made contact.

911
01:26:09,546 --> 01:26:10,962
What are you doing?

912
01:26:11,162 --> 01:26:13,493
All the cameras are connected.
We gotta block them out.

913
01:26:13,694 --> 01:26:14,694
Sir?

914
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:25,759
Say, cheese!

915
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:46,659
Fire ventilation.
Let's go.

916
01:26:48,095 --> 01:26:50,604
Engage security protocol 5.

917
01:27:18,395 --> 01:27:20,645
We're out gunned.
The walls are locked outside.

918
01:27:20,845 --> 01:27:21,845
8 minutes.

919
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:24,061
They are out of moves.

920
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:26,101
Drake, take two men.

921
01:27:26,979 --> 01:27:30,194
Drag the rats back to cages.

922
01:28:11,779 --> 01:28:14,359
Javed!

923
01:28:15,949 --> 01:28:17,920
Open Gate 3!

924
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:33,686
Go, go..go!
Don't fucking loose them.

925
01:28:36,835 --> 01:28:38,015
Breslin.

926
01:28:49,659 --> 01:28:50,704
We gotta move.

927
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:04,720
As soon as that door's down.
I'll cover you guys from the other side.

928
01:29:05,729 --> 01:29:07,654
Breslin, how the hell did
they know where we are?

929
01:29:07,854 --> 01:29:10,159
You turned off the cameras, right?

930
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:20,104
Motion detector.

931
01:29:20,304 --> 01:29:21,304
Sir?

932
01:29:21,503 --> 01:29:22,503
Out.

933
01:29:36,356 --> 01:29:39,956
You can play your games all day, Mr.Breslin.
But i am still in control.

934
01:29:40,939 --> 01:29:43,875
Whatever you do,
I have the power.

935
01:29:46,016 --> 01:29:47,465
I own your ass.

936
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,425
You guys can get up that ladder.

937
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:53,640
I gotta find the engine room.
We shut the power and wait them down.

938
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,466
Those magnetic glasses door
open for about 5 seconds,

939
01:29:56,666 --> 01:29:58,668
before the back-up generator
kicks in. You understand?

940
01:29:58,868 --> 01:29:59,880
It's all the time you're gonna have.

941
01:30:04,595 --> 01:30:05,925
Take this, take it.

942
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,132
You are a good man.

943
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:12,989
Go for it.

944
01:30:13,585 --> 01:30:14,716
What about you?

945
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:15,708
I'll be right behind you.

946
01:30:15,908 --> 01:30:16,908
But what if you're not up
there on deck in 5.

947
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:22,569
Do what you gotta do.
There's always plan B.

948
01:30:29,552 --> 01:30:30,886
Come with me, let's do it.

949
01:30:31,086 --> 01:30:32,086
I'm dead man.
There is no way out.

950
01:30:32,286 --> 01:30:33,286
You're coming with me.

951
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:37,234
I'll carry you up there.

952
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:41,032
- I'm not gonna leave you behind.
- Give me your gun.

953
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:45,547
Just give me your gun.

954
01:31:00,317 --> 01:31:01,907
I'll see you up there.

955
01:31:02,106 --> 01:31:03,106
Now, go.

956
01:31:04,975 --> 01:31:08,510
Take care.

957
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:38,177
- Report.
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.

958
01:31:38,377 --> 01:31:39,377
We are taking gunfire
at the lower deck.

959
01:31:41,837 --> 01:31:43,872
If they're at lower deck
it's going to be their exit route.

960
01:31:44,072 --> 01:31:45,860
Meet me at the engine room.
I'm coming down.

961
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,060
Copy.

962
01:31:47,261 --> 01:31:49,413
- Get that fucker out.
- Yes, sir.

963
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:20,765
Yeah. Whatever.

964
01:34:02,395 --> 01:34:03,399
Come on.

965
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:11,314
I'll fucking kill you, motherfucker!

966
01:34:40,109 --> 01:34:41,420
- Yeah, he is here.
<i>- We are on our way.</i>

967
01:34:41,619 --> 01:34:43,811
- I'll take care of it.
<i>- No, wait..wait!</i>

968
01:35:32,909 --> 01:35:34,800
What the fuck?

969
01:36:31,789 --> 01:36:34,649
- Fuck me.
- No one gets off this ship.

970
01:37:07,582 --> 01:37:08,969
We have to move now!

971
01:37:09,168 --> 01:37:10,168
Not yet.

972
01:37:34,779 --> 01:37:37,279
Give yourself up, Mr.Breslin.

973
01:37:38,904 --> 01:37:42,030
Give a look around,
make some noise.

974
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:47,234
This is no cell block.
You can't get out.

975
01:37:49,734 --> 01:37:51,984
Not really.

976
01:37:53,471 --> 01:37:57,576
I know about your wife...
your son.

977
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:03,838
I know every detail.

978
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,609
So, thank you.

979
01:38:04,809 --> 01:38:08,613
For pointing out all the small flaws
in my creation.

980
01:38:08,814 --> 01:38:11,185
I'll be sure to fortify them.

981
01:38:13,224 --> 01:38:14,770
Cos your time is up.

982
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:15,970
You hear me?

983
01:38:16,739 --> 01:38:18,060
Breslin?

984
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:23,878
Your time is up.

985
01:38:28,899 --> 01:38:32,979
Go in there.
Search every inch of this fucking room.

986
01:39:38,463 --> 01:39:39,682
Breslin?

987
01:39:54,694 --> 01:40:00,609
Go, down!

988
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:35,389
Rottmayar!
Gun!

989
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:37,889
- Gun?
- Give me your gun.

990
01:41:20,002 --> 01:41:21,707
Boom.

991
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:34,454
Have a lovely day.

992
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:36,779
Asshole.

993
01:42:11,904 --> 01:42:12,993
Now, what?

994
01:42:13,193 --> 01:42:14,193
Relax.

995
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:55,418
- You met her before.
<i>- Jessica Miller.</i>

996
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,918
It's an honour to meet you.

997
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,742
Your work is a gold standard in field.

998
01:42:59,942 --> 01:43:02,445
She's been my eyes and ears
inside the Agency.

999
01:43:02,645 --> 01:43:03,645
Hello, Dad.

1000
01:43:03,439 --> 01:43:05,921
And she's also my daughter.

1001
01:43:06,122 --> 01:43:07,122
Hello, darling.

1002
01:43:08,695 --> 01:43:10,059
Thank God, you made it.

1003
01:43:11,738 --> 01:43:12,739
I've missed you.

1004
01:43:14,409 --> 01:43:15,835
What happened?

1005
01:43:16,034 --> 01:43:17,034
Oh, nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1006
01:43:20,608 --> 01:43:21,854
You are Mannheim.

1007
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:25,748
Didn't see that coming.

1008
01:43:25,948 --> 01:43:26,948
You shouldn't.

1009
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:31,789
Yeah.

1010
01:43:32,510 --> 01:43:33,990
How did you do it?

1011
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:35,190
We have code names.

1012
01:43:35,789 --> 01:43:40,350
Code name Rottmayar, meant
maximum security incarceration.

1013
01:43:41,289 --> 01:43:43,788
When my dad was picked up.

1014
01:43:43,789 --> 01:43:45,479
It activated the code.

1015
01:43:45,680 --> 01:43:48,966
- And that's when you...
- I needed the best.

1016
01:43:49,166 --> 01:43:50,689
And after you agreed to do it.

1017
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:54,365
I used my contact deep inside
the DHS to get you in.

1018
01:43:54,565 --> 01:43:56,421
And the name you gave me
was the ID code?

1019
01:43:56,859 --> 01:43:58,024
<i>Portos.</i>

1020
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,180
Rottmayar, Emil Rottmayar.

1021
01:44:01,869 --> 01:44:04,326
And I became your best friend.

1022
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,243
You are not easy friend to have there.

1023
01:44:10,443 --> 01:44:12,695
I mean, I had to work very hard.

1024
01:44:12,895 --> 01:44:13,895
That damn box.

1025
01:44:14,095 --> 01:44:15,095
I mean, that was hot.

1026
01:44:15,609 --> 01:44:16,935
Didn't think you had warm yet.

1027
01:44:17,704 --> 01:44:19,064
But it doesn't matter.

1028
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:22,595
What matters is that I am out,
so are you.

1029
01:44:23,489 --> 01:44:24,604
Don't sweat for no time.

1030
01:44:27,529 --> 01:44:30,765
You wanna try it again?

1031
01:44:30,965 --> 01:44:33,849
You son of a bitch.

1032
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:40,490
- I hope, i never see you again.
- Well, that hurts.

1033
01:44:48,130 --> 01:44:49,454
One more thing.

1034
01:44:51,274 --> 01:44:54,114
- How much does Les really know?
- Only what i told him at first.

1035
01:44:54,895 --> 01:44:57,137
But the next thing i know,
he's going around me

1036
01:44:57,337 --> 01:44:59,228
and offered his services
to the backers of The Tomb.

1037
01:44:59,427 --> 01:45:00,300
So, he knew where i was being sent?

1038
01:45:00,914 --> 01:45:02,390
He arranged your transport.

1039
01:45:05,416 --> 01:45:06,855
You need a ride?

1040
01:45:07,055 --> 01:45:08,055
No, thanks.

1041
01:45:08,256 --> 01:45:09,256
I've made my own arrangements.

1042
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:26,880
It wasn't tracking.
We knew something wasn't right.

1043
01:45:27,335 --> 01:45:29,458
Red flags going up all over the place.

1044
01:45:29,658 --> 01:45:32,448
Clark was too calm about it.
So, we started digging.

1045
01:45:33,135 --> 01:45:35,100
We found out,
he'd been offered the CEO job

1046
01:45:35,301 --> 01:45:36,301
of running the whole
tomb programme.

1047
01:45:36,689 --> 01:45:39,104
As a prototype, he would bear the proof
that it was inescapable.

1048
01:45:39,305 --> 01:45:41,645
With a salary of 5 million a year
plus stock options.

1049
01:45:41,845 --> 01:45:42,845
Tell me, you've tracked
him down.

1050
01:45:42,989 --> 01:45:45,329
Just like you asked.
The plan is in motion as we speak.

1051
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:02,810
Sleeping time, motherfucker!

1052
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:18,944
Oh, fuck!

1053
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,627
Hush.

1054
01:46:42,828 --> 01:46:43,828
What did he say?

1055
01:46:44,028 --> 01:46:45,028
It's all good.

1056
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:49,779
Good.

1057
01:46:50,814 --> 01:46:52,329
- What's that?
- Job offers.

1058
01:46:52,529 --> 01:46:53,529
Ignore them, maybe later.

1059
01:46:53,425 --> 01:46:56,283
