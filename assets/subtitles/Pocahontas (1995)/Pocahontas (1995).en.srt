1
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:15,156
In sixteen hundred seven

2
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:17,807
We sailed the open sea

3
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:23,120
For glory, God and gold
and the Virginia Company

4
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:25,721
For the New World
is like heaven

5
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:28,367
And we'll all be rich and free

6
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:33,919
Or so we have been told
by the Virginia Company

7
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:39,161
So we have been told
by the Virginia Company

8
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:55,243
For glory, God and gold
and the Virginia Company

9
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:58,478
- Ready to hoist the cannon?
- Right!
- Hey, look. Is that Smith?

10
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,683
That's him, all right.
The old sea dog.

11
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:03,839
Captain John Smith.
I've heard some amazing
stories about him.

12
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:07,442
- Are you coming
on this voyage too?
- Of course he is, you half-wit.

13
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:10,121
You can't fight Indians
without John Smith.

14
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:13,916
That's right. I'm not about to
let you boys have all the fun.

15
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,396
On the beaches of Virginny

16
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:19,921
There's diamonds like debris

17
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:25,320
There silver rivers flow
and gold you pick
right off a tree

18
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:27,318
With a nugget for my Winnie

19
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:30,080
And another one for me

20
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:35,366
And all the rest will go
to the Virginia Company

21
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:37,915
To glory, God and gold

22
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:44,276
And the Virginia Company

23
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:51,043
Haul on the brace!

24
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:54,563
- Come on, come on!
- Do your best!

25
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,797
Watch out!

26
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,883
Faster!
She's taking on more water!

27
00:02:05,687 --> 00:02:07,678
Look out!

28
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:13,322
John! Get down here!

29
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:16,205
The cannons are breaking loose!

30
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,759
- Reef the topsails!
- Yes, sir!
- Steady on your course.

31
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:25,645
It's all right, Thomas.
We'll get her tied off.

32
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:27,957
Say your prayers, men!

33
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,727
Thomas, watch it!

34
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:43,758
Help!

35
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:46,805
- Man overboard!
- Help!

36
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:49,845
- Stay your course! He's lost!
- Help!

37
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:52,646
- Pull the pins!
- Aye, sir!

38
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:59,639
Smith! Smith!

39
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:02,998
Are you crazy?

40
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:06,882
Hang on, Thomas!
I've got you!

41
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:11,847
Quick! The rope!

42
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:13,758
Heave!

43
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:20,603
Come on, lads! Pull!

44
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:25,237
- Pull! Pull!
- Pull! Pull!

45
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:27,966
- Put your back into it!
- Pull!

46
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:30,038
- Pull!
- Hang on!

47
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:36,804
There, my lucky lads.

48
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:39,481
Well, that was refreshing.

49
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,523
Well done, Smith.

50
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:45,077
Of course, you'd all
do the same for me.

51
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,362
- Oh, sure, sure.
Of course we would.
- Sure, yes. Yeah, we would.

52
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,278
Absolutely!

53
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:54,123
- Trouble on deck?
- Governor Ratcliffe.

54
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:57,756
- Thomas fell overboard, sir.
- Thank heavens he's been successfully retrieved.

55
00:03:57,847 --> 00:03:59,963
- Well done, Smith.
- Thank you, sir.

56
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:04,120
Don't lose heart, men.
It won't be long before we reach the New World.

57
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:07,404
And remember
what awaits us there.

58
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:10,479
Freedom, prosperity...

59
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,523
the adventure of our lives.

60
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:15,883
You're the finest crew
England has to offer, and nothing--

61
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:19,243
not wind nor rain nor a thousand
bloodthirsty savages--

62
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,238
shall stand in our way.

63
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,158
Carry on, men!

64
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:26,484
A stirring oration, sir.

65
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:29,286
I'm sure the men
were most exhilarated.

66
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:34,839
Let us hope so.
I'll need those witless peasants
to dig up my gold, won't I?

67
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,521
This New World's
gonna be great,John.

68
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:42,405
I'm gonna get a pile of gold,
build me a big house...

69
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:45,638
and if any Indian tries
to stop me, I'll blast him.

70
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:48,195
You just worry about
that fortune of yours, Thomas.

71
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:51,279
- Leave the savages to me.
- You think they'll give us much trouble?

72
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:54,279
Not as much trouble
as Smith'll give them.

73
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,562
We'll kill ourselves an lnjun

74
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:59,400
Or maybe two or three

75
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:04,322
We're stalwart men and bold
of the Virginia Company

76
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:06,602
What do you suppose
the New World will look like?

77
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,837
Like all the others, I suppose.

78
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:11,919
I've seen hundreds
of new worlds, Thomas.

79
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:14,601
What could possibly
be different about this one?

80
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:22,563
lt's glory, God and gold
And the Virginia Company

81
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:05,398
Steady as the beating drum
Singing to the cedar flute

82
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:07,557
Seasons go and seasons come

83
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:11,720
Bring the corn and bear the fruit

84
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:16,119
By the waters sweet and clean
Where the mighty sturgeon lives

85
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:18,482
Plant the squash and reapa the bean

86
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:22,401
All the Earth our mother gives

87
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:26,878
Oh, great spirit, hear our song
Helpa us keepa the ancient ways

88
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:29,686
Keepa the sacred fire strong

89
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:33,157
Walk in balance all our days

90
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:37,718
Seasons go and seasons come
steady as the beating drum

91
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:41,800
Plum to seed to bud to palum

92
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:46,926
Steady as the beating drum

93
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:04,278
It's good to be home.

94
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:08,678
The Massawomecks are defeated!

95
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:12,999
With the help of our brothers,
our villages are safe again.

96
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:18,436
Your return has brought much joy to the village.

97
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,485
Look at all the smiling faces.

98
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:25,083
Yes, but there's one smiling face I don't see.

99
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:28,284
- Where is my daughter?
- You know Pocahontas.

100
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,323
She has her mother's spirit.

101
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:32,875
She goes wherever the wind takes her.

102
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:53,760
Pocahontas!

103
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:57,806
Your father's back!
Come down here!

104
00:07:57,887 --> 00:08:00,003
He's back, Flit.

105
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,204
Come on, Meeko!

106
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:14,557
No! Not that way.

107
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,237
Show-off.

108
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:34,042
Uh-oh!

109
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:41,161
Pocahontas?

110
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:44,523
Pocahontas! Are you all right?

111
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,316
Well, you better be all right
because I'm not coming in after you!

112
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,843
Don't you think we're getting a--
a little old for these games?

113
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,157
Help me turn this thing over.

114
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:22,156
- What were you doing up there?
- Thinking.

115
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:26,399
- Meeko!
- About the dream again? Have you figured it out yet?

116
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:29,126
I know it means something.
I just don't know what.

117
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:31,118
You should ask your father about it.

118
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:33,721
Maybe I should.
Come on, Flit.

119
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:37,555
Quit playing around.
We have to get back.

120
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:43,282
...faced a determined enemy.

121
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:48,122
The battle lasted from the rising of the sun
until the evening shadows fell.

122
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:52,917
Our warriors fought with courage, but none
as bravely as Kocoum...

123
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:55,805
for he attacked with the fierce strength of the bear.

124
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,197
- He has proven himself to be the greatest of warriors...
- Oh, he is so handsome.

125
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:01,323
- and the finest among us...
- Hmph. I especially love his smile.

126
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:03,363
destroying every enemy in his path.

127
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:05,915
Tonight we will feast in his honour.

128
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,237
- My daughter.
- Wing-gapa-o, Father.

129
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:14,841
Seeing you gives me great joy.

130
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:17,236
I'm so glad you've come home safely.

131
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:20,319
Come with me.
We have much to talk about.

132
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:22,875
I want to hear everything you've been doing.

133
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:31,122
Father, for many nights now
I've been having a very strange dream.

134
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:34,722
I think it's telling me something's about to happen.
Something exciting.

135
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:38,846
Yes, something exciting is about to happen.

136
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:43,842
- Really? What is it?
- Kocoum has asked to seek your hand in marriage.

137
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:46,600
Marry Kocoum?

138
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,436
I told him it would make my heart soar.

139
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:57,326
But he's so serious.

140
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,240
My daughter, Kocoum will make a fine husband.

141
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:04,559
He is loyal and strong and will build you a good house
with sturdy walls.

142
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:06,478
With him, you will be safe from harm.

143
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,445
Father, I think my dream is pointing me down another path.

144
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:13,964
-This is the right path for you.
-But why can't I choose--

145
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:25,198
Pocahontas, come with me.
You are the daughter of the chief.

146
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:27,676
It is time to take your place among our people.

147
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,997
Even the wild mountain stream...

148
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:32,237
must someday join the big river.

149
00:11:32,327 --> 00:11:36,525
As the river cuts his paath

150
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:40,998
Though the river's paroud and strong

151
00:11:41,087 --> 00:11:45,638
He will choose the smoothest course

152
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:49,003
That's why rivers live so long.

153
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:51,681
They're steady

154
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:55,726
As the steady beating drum

155
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:58,719
Your mother wore this for our wedding.

156
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:01,446
It was her dream to see you
wear it at your own.

157
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,084
It suits you.

158
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:14,399
He wants me to be steady
like the river.

159
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,317
But it's not steady at all.

160
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:26,964
What I love most about rivers
is you can't stepa in the same river twice

161
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:30,960
The water's always changing
always flowing

162
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:34,483
But people, I guess can't live like that
We all must pay a price

163
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:38,003
To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing

164
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:41,363
What's around the river bend

165
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:44,883
Waiting just around the river bend

166
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:48,880
I look once more just around the river bend

167
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:52,198
Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free

168
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:54,243
Don't know what for

169
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:59,447
What I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend

170
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,599
For me

171
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:06,965
Coming for me

172
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:11,598
I feel it there beyond those trees or right
behind these waterfalls

173
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:14,963
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming

174
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:18,801
For a handsome sturdy husband who builds
handsome, sturdy walls

175
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:22,596
And never dreams that something might be coming

176
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:26,202
Just around the river bend

177
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:29,757
Just around the river bend

178
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:33,362
I look once more just around the river bend

179
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:36,917
Beyond the shore 
Somewhere past the sea

180
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:40,716
Don't know what for
Why do all my dreams extend

181
00:13:40,807 --> 00:13:44,482
Just around the river bend

182
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:47,718
Just around the river bend

183
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:53,398
Should I choose the smoothest course

184
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:56,684
Steady as the beating drum

185
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:01,840
Should I marry Kocoum

186
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:05,715
Is all my dreaming at an end

187
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:11,402
Or do you still

188
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:13,717
Wait for me

189
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:16,844
Dream giver

190
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:22,320
Just around the river

191
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:29,763
Bend

192
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:55,963
Is that my Pocahontas?

193
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:58,641
Grandmother Willow,
I need to talk to you.

194
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:03,121
Good morning, child.

195
00:15:03,207 --> 00:15:05,516
I was hoping you'd visit today.

196
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:08,724
Oh! Why, your mother's necklace!

197
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,446
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

198
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,483
My father wants me to marry Kocoum.

199
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:16,923
Kocoum? But he's so serious.

200
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:20,761
I know. My father thinks it's the right path for me.

201
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:23,600
But lately, I've been having
this dream and I think it's--

202
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:27,885
Oh, a dream!
Let's hear all about it.

203
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:32,240
Quiet!

204
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:33,726
Quiet!

205
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,277
Now, child, you were saying.

206
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:43,881
Well, I'm running through the woods...

207
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:46,481
and then, right there in front of me, is an arrow.

208
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,956
As I look at it, it starts to spin.

209
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:52,562
A spinning arrow.
How unusual.

210
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:57,767
Yes. It spins faster and faster and faster
until suddenly it stops.

211
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:03,159
Hmm. Well, it seems to me...

212
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:06,637
this spinning arrow is pointing you down your path.

213
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:09,844
But, Grandmother Willow, what is my path?

214
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,680
How am I ever going to find it?

215
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:16,157
Your mother asked me the very same question.

216
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:18,477
She did? What did you tell her?

217
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:21,445
I told her to listen.

218
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:24,246
All around you are spirits, child.

219
00:16:24,327 --> 00:16:29,242
They live in the earth, the water, the sky.

220
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:32,956
If you listen, they will guide you.

221
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:38,475
- I hear the wind.
- Yes.

222
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,876
What is it telling you?

223
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,878
I don't understand.

224
00:16:46,727 --> 00:16:49,719
You will understand

225
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:53,436
Listen with your heart

226
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:56,997
You will understand

227
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,999
Let it break upon you

228
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:03,045
Like a wave upon the sand

229
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:06,483
It's saying something's coming.
Strange clouds?

230
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,684
Listen with your heart

231
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:16,240
- You will understand
- You will understand

232
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,322
What do you see?

233
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:26,036
Clouds. Strange clouds.

234
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:34,525
Look at it, Wiggins.
An entire new world chock full of gold...

235
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:36,598
just waiting for me.

236
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:40,839
And scores of adventures waiting for us. 
Right, Percy?

237
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,725
- Do you think we'll meet some savages?
- If we do, we shall be sure...

238
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:47,436
- to give them a proper English greeting.
- Ooh, gift baskets.

239
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:51,520
Oh, no. And he came so highly recommended.

240
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:57,077
It's perfect, Governor. The water's deep enough.
We can pull right up to shore.

241
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:00,204
Hey there, Percy.

242
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,562
- Very well, then. Give the order.
- Already done, sir.

243
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:04,603
I've got a crew assembled
and they're ready to go.

244
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:07,485
About the natives, I'm counting on you...

245
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:10,525
to make sure those filthy heathens 
don't disrupt our mission.

246
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:14,805
Well, if they're anything like the savages 
I've fought before, it's nothing I can't handle.

247
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,845
Right. That'll be all, Smith.
There's a good man.

248
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:20,236
See you, Percy.

249
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:25,997
The men like Smith, don't they?

250
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:30,239
- I've never been a popular man.
- I like you.

251
00:18:30,327 --> 00:18:34,115
And don't think I don't know what those
back stabbers at court say about me.

252
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:37,517
Oh, yes, all that talk about being a pathetic 
social climber who's failed at everything...

253
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:40,883
- He's tried.
- I'm very well aware that this is my last chance for glory.

254
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:45,324
But mark my words, Wiggins. When King James 
sees the gold these peasants unearth...

255
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:49,320
success will be mine at last.

256
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:53,196
- Wake up! Shake a leg!
- Top off the yardarm!

257
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:57,838
- It's incredible!
- And it's all ours. I've never seen anything like it.

258
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,236
It could look like Ratcliffe's
knickers, for all I care...

259
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:02,921
just as long as I get off  this stinkin' boat.

260
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:06,238
Come on, men. We didn't come
all this way just to look at it.

261
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:00,683
Keep it taut, lads.
Keep it taut.

262
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:04,726
- Steady! Steady!
- Hold up! That's far enough.

263
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:07,162
All right, now. Tie her off.

264
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,320
Here,John, tie off this end.
John? John?

265
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:16,163
- What are you doing up there?
- Getting a better look.

266
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:41,518
Hey!

267
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:49,806
Well. You're a
strange-looking fellow.

268
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:52,401
Are you hungry?
Here you go.

269
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:56,480
Ah, it's a biscuit.
It's food. Well, sort of.

270
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:02,998
You like it, eh?
Well, try eating it for four months straight.

271
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:09,521
You got a friend back there?

272
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:22,163
Hey! Wh-- What? Watch out.

273
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,807
What? Get-- No, get--
Uh, look out.

274
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:28,721
John, you better get down here.
The governor's coming ashore.

275
00:21:28,807 --> 00:21:31,367
All right. All right.
I'm leaving.

276
00:21:47,047 --> 00:21:49,277
Did you see their skin?

277
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,323
They have hair on their faces like dogs.

278
00:21:51,407 --> 00:21:54,956
My brothers, we must know more
about these visitors.

279
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,800
Kekata, what do you see?

280
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:15,684
These are not men like us...

281
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:21,599
but strange beasts with bodies
that shine like the sun...

282
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:25,999
and weapons that spout fire and thunder.

283
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:33,037
They prowl the Earth
like ravenous wolves...

284
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:37,279
consuming everything in their path.

285
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:44,401
Great Powhatan, I will lead our 
warriors to the river and attack.

286
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:48,241
We will destroy these invaders
the way we destroyed the Massawomecks.

287
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:51,637
Kocoum, in that battle
we knew how to fight our enemy.

288
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:54,161
But these pale visitors
are strange to us.

289
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,602
Take some men to the river
to observe them.

290
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:59,201
Let us hope they do not intend to stay.

291
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,917
I hereby claim this land
and all its riches...

292
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,316
in the name of His Majesty
King James the First...

293
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:10,605
and do so name this settlement Jamestown.

294
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:14,600
Bravo! Bravo!
Beautifully spoken, sir.

295
00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:18,362
Hurry now, Percy. We must be all 
squeaky clean for the New World.

296
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:04,795
Captain Smith, it appears I've selected the 
perfect location, eh? Not a savage in sight.

297
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:08,197
Just because we don't see them
doesn't mean they're not out there, sir.

298
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:13,566
Well, then perhaps you should venture forth 
and determine their whereabouts, hmm?

299
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:16,207
If there are any Indians
out there, I'll find them.

300
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:22,397
-Now, gentlemen, to work. You men, get the ship unloaded.
-Right, sir.

301
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:26,275
You men, build the fort.
The rest of you, break out the shovels.

302
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:29,165
- It's time to start digging.
- Digging?
- Digging?

303
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:34,321
Why, of course. Let's not forget what the Spanish 
found when they came to the New World.

304
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:37,365
Gold! Mountains of it.

305
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:40,917
Why, for years they've been
ravaging the New World...

306
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:43,123
of its most precious resources...

307
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:45,038
but now...

308
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:49,247
it's our turn.

309
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:53,286
The gold of Cortez
The jewels of Pizarro

310
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,916
Will seem like mere trinkets
by this time tomorrow

311
00:24:57,007 --> 00:25:00,602
The gold we find here will dwarf them by far

312
00:25:00,687 --> 00:25:03,599
Oh, with all you got in ya, boys

313
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:07,396
Dig up Virginia, boys

314
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:10,524
Mine, boys
Mine every mountain

315
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:13,724
And dig, boys
Dig 'til you drop

316
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:17,197
Grab a pick, boys
Quick, boys

317
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:22,919
Shove in a shovel
Uncover those loverly pebbles that sparkle and shine

318
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:26,886
lt's gold and it's mine

319
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:29,083
Mine, mine

320
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:31,920
Dig and dig and diggety dig

321
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,396
And dig and dig and diggety dig

322
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:37,445
- Hei, nonny, nonny. Hei, nonny, nonny
- Ooh, how I love it.

323
00:25:37,527 --> 00:25:40,439
- Hei, nonny, nonny. Hei, nonny, nonny
- Riches for cheap.

324
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:43,325
- Hei, nonny, nonny. Ho, nonny, nonny
- There'll be heaps of it.

325
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:48,197
- And I'll be on top of the heap
- Diggety, diggety, dig

326
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:51,245
My rivals back home 
It's not that I'm bitter

327
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:54,797
But think how they'll squirm
when they see how I glitter

328
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,323
The ladies at court will be all a-twitter

329
00:25:58,407 --> 00:26:03,356
The king will reward me
He'll knight me
No, lord me

330
00:26:03,447 --> 00:26:06,962
lt's mine, mine
Mine for the taking

331
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:10,039
lt's mine, boys
Mine me that gold

332
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:12,800
With those nuggets dug

333
00:26:12,887 --> 00:26:14,843
lt's glory they'll gimme

334
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:19,239
My dear friend King Jimmy
will parobably build me a shrine

335
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,763
- When all of the gold
- When all of the gold

336
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:26,635
- Is mined
- Dig and dig and diggety dig

337
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:29,685
And dig and dig and diggety dig

338
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:35,558
All of my life I have searched
for a land like this one

339
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:42,041
A wilder, more challenging
country I couldn't design

340
00:26:42,127 --> 00:26:48,316
Hundreds of dangers await
and I don't palan to miss one

341
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:51,479
In a land I can claim
A land I can tame

342
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:54,957
- The greatest adventure is mine
- Keep on working, lads

343
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,878
- Mine
- Don't be shirking, lads

344
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:59,720
- Mine, boys, mine
- Find a mother lode. Then mine another load

345
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:04,881
- Mine me that gold
- Dig, dig and diggety

346
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:07,481
- Beautiful gold
- Dig, dig for that gold

347
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:11,321
Make this island my land

348
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:14,444
- Make the mounds big, boys. I'd help you to dig, boys
- Dig, dig

349
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:16,563
But I've got this crick in my spine

350
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:19,923
- This land we behold
- This beauty untold

351
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:23,443
- A man can be bold
- It all can be sold

352
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:25,916
- So go for the gold
- The gold

353
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:28,396
- Is
- All the riches here
- Mine

354
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:30,682
- From this minute this land
- Mine
- And what's in it

355
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:33,998
- Is mine
- And dig and dig and diggety dig

356
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,237
Hey, nonny, nonny
It's mine

357
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:17,804
No! Wait. Please.

358
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,163
Please!

359
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:31,242
Don't run off.

360
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:37,003
It's all right.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

361
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,396
Here. Let me help you out of there.

362
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:46,402
You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you?

363
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:52,476
It's all right.

364
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:11,797
Listen with your heart

365
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:15,243
You will understand

366
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:24,881
Let it break upon you

367
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:30,325
Like a wave upon the sand

368
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:35,435
- Who are you?
- Listen with your heart

369
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:40,317
You will understand

370
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:42,637
Pocahontas.

371
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:45,082
What? What did you say?

372
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:48,477
My name is Pocahontas.

373
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:54,564
I'm John Smith.

374
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:01,083
That's it.
Keep at it, men.

375
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:05,718
Keep digging. It's got to be here somewhere.

376
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:09,117
-There's 30 more of them down by the ridge.
-That makes more than a hundred.

377
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:12,764
- Anything yet?
- Nothing but rocks and dirt, sir.

378
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:16,522
- Um, how long are we going to
keep digging like this, sir?
- Aye.

379
00:32:16,607 --> 00:32:19,041
We're slaving away, busting our backs
day and night...

380
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:21,402
- for--
- For king and country. I know, I know.

381
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:25,036
And I share your fatigue.
Mmm. Wiggins?

382
00:32:25,127 --> 00:32:28,517
- Wiggins?
- Coming!

383
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:30,438
Dispose of this.

384
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:36,404
Who's a good doggy, hmm?
Who's a good doggy?

385
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,557
Fetch, boy!

386
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:46,642
- Savages! It's an ambush! Arm yourselves!
- Run!

387
00:32:46,727 --> 00:32:49,605
Arm yourselves!

388
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:52,963
Make sure every manhas a musket.

389
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:55,038
Shoot!

390
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,996
Them, you idiot!

391
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:12,165
Where's that blasted Smith when I need him?

392
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:20,642
Namontack!

393
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:32,482
Back to the village.

394
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:37,996
Shut up. Shut up, you fools!
They'll be back.

395
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:44,080
Everyone, back to camp. Get the rest of 
the cannons ashore and finish building the fort!

396
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,044
Aye, Governor.

397
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:48,482
And you.

398
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:50,797
Learn to use that thing properly.

399
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:54,357
A man's not a man unless he knows how to shoot.

400
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:06,405
These beasts invade our shores, and now this.

401
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:11,527
This wound is strange to me.

402
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:18,206
We will fight this enemy, but we cannot 
do it alone.

403
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:21,802
Kocoum, send messengers
to every village in our nation.

404
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:24,242
We will call on our brothers to help us fight.

405
00:34:24,327 --> 00:34:27,000
These white men are dangerous.

406
00:34:27,087 --> 00:34:29,396
No one is to go near them.

407
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:36,041
- It's called a helmet.
- Helmet.

408
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:42,643
- So, uh, what river is this?
- Qui-yough-co-hannock.

409
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:45,480
You have the most unusual names here.

410
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:52,237
Pocahontas.

411
00:34:52,327 --> 00:34:55,444
You have the most unusual name too.

412
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,166
John Smith.

413
00:34:58,247 --> 00:35:00,556
Hey!

414
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:02,603
Is this bottomless pit a friend of yours?

415
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:04,518
Meeko!

416
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:06,757
Well, how do you do, Meeko?

417
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:13,120
It's all right. It's just a handshake.
Here, let me show you.

418
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:19,839
- Nothing's happening.
- Uh, no, no. I need your hand first.

419
00:35:24,607 --> 00:35:27,519
It's how we say hello.

420
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,483
This is how we say hello.

421
00:35:39,647 --> 00:35:41,922
And how we say goodbye.

422
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:45,597
I like hello better.

423
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:53,123
Yeah, I remember you.

424
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:56,238
Flit just doesn't like strangers.

425
00:35:56,327 --> 00:35:58,204
Well, I'm not a stranger any more.

426
00:35:58,287 --> 00:36:00,676
Hmm. Stubborn little fellow, isn't he?

427
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,644
Very stubborn.

428
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,558
Hey!

429
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:07,400
Meeko, come back here.

430
00:36:07,487 --> 00:36:10,718
Don't worry. He can't hurt it.
Hey! What are you doing? Get--

431
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:13,367
- Meeko, bring that back!
- N-No, it's all right.

432
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:15,358
He can keep it. Call it a gift.

433
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:20,602
- What was that?
- My compass.

434
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:23,520
- Compass?
- It tells you how to find 
your way when you get lost.

435
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:25,677
But it's all right.
I'll get another one in London.

436
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,122
- London. Is that your village?
- Yes.

437
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:30,516
- It's a very big village.
- What's it like?

438
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:34,998
Well, it's got streets filled with carriages,
bridges over the rivers...

439
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:37,555
and buildings as tall as trees.

440
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:39,524
- I'd like to see those things.
- You will.

441
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:41,438
-How?
-We're going to build them here.

442
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:45,645
We'll show your people how to use this 
land properly, how to make the most of it.

443
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:47,763
- Make the most of it?
- Yes.

444
00:36:47,847 --> 00:36:51,920
- We'll build roads and decent houses and--
- Our houses are fine.

445
00:36:52,007 --> 00:36:54,965
You think that only because
you don't know any better.

446
00:36:56,487 --> 00:37:00,036
W-Wait a minute.
Don't take it tha-- Hey. Hey!

447
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:02,925
Wait! Wa-Wait!

448
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:04,998
There's so much we can teach you.

449
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:08,045
- We've improved the lives of savages 
all over the world.
- Savages?

450
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:10,197
Uh, not that you're a savage.

451
00:37:10,287 --> 00:37:14,644
-Just my people.
- No. Listen. That's not what 
I meant. Let me explain, uh--

452
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:17,685
- Let go!
- No, I'm not letting you leave.

453
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:21,204
Look, don't do this.

454
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:24,723
Savage is just a word, uh, you know.

455
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:29,403
- A term for people who are uncivilized.
- Like me.

456
00:37:29,487 --> 00:37:33,719
Well, when I say uncivilized, what I mean is, is--

457
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:46,401
What you mean is, not like you.

458
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:49,240
You think I'm an ignorant savage

459
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:53,878
And you've been so many palaces
I guess it must be so

460
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:56,561
But still I cannot see

461
00:37:56,647 --> 00:37:59,764
If the savage one is me

462
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:05,399
How can there be so much that you don't know

463
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:10,322
You don't know

464
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:22,683
You think you own whatever land you land on

465
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:27,079
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim

466
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:31,319
But I know every rock and tree and creature

467
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:33,762
Has a life, has a spirit

468
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:35,917
Has a name

469
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:40,285
You think the only people who are people

470
00:38:40,367 --> 00:38:44,360
Are the people who look
and think like you

471
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,440
But if you walk the footstepas
of a stranger

472
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:53,078
You'll learn things
you never knew you never knew

473
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:57,763
Have you ever heard the wolf cry
to the blue corn moon

474
00:38:57,847 --> 00:39:01,886
Or asked the grinning bobcat
why he grinned

475
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:06,483
Can you sing with all the voices
of the mountain

476
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:11,163
Can you paint
with all the colours of the wind

477
00:39:11,247 --> 00:39:14,557
Can you paint
with all the colours

478
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:18,083
Of the wind

479
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:28,561
Come run the hidden paine trails
of the forest

480
00:39:28,647 --> 00:39:32,686
Come taste the sun sweet berries
of the Earth

481
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:36,396
Come roll in all the riches
all around you

482
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:40,878
And for once never wonder
what they're worth

483
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:44,846
The rainstorm and the river
are my brothers

484
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:49,364
The heron and the otter
are my friends

485
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:53,360
And we are all connected
to each other

486
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:58,123
In a circle
In a hoop that never ends

487
00:39:58,207 --> 00:40:02,246
How high does the sycamore grow

488
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:07,924
If you cut it down then you'll never know

489
00:40:08,007 --> 00:40:13,604
And you'll never hear the wolf
cry to the blue corn moon

490
00:40:13,687 --> 00:40:17,965
For whether we are white or copapaer-skinned

491
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:22,484
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain

492
00:40:22,567 --> 00:40:27,357
We need to paint with all the colours of the wind

493
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:30,200
You can own the Earth and still

494
00:40:30,287 --> 00:40:33,518
All you'll own is earth until

495
00:40:33,607 --> 00:40:36,280
You can paint

496
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,325
With all the colours

497
00:40:39,407 --> 00:40:48,600
Of the wind

498
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,558
What is it?

499
00:41:04,647 --> 00:41:06,478
The drums.

500
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:10,276
They mean trouble. I shouldn't be here.

501
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,403
- I want to see you again.
- I can't.

502
00:41:12,487 --> 00:41:14,603
- Please, don't leave.
- I'm sorry.

503
00:41:17,527 --> 00:41:19,358
I have to go.

504
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:31,716
All right!
This one's ready to hoist!

505
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:34,241
- Two on each side.
- Ready now. Push!

506
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:38,923
- Watch it. It's slippery.
- Come on, lads. It's only a little picket fence.

507
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:41,157
- Steady. Steady.
- There you go.

508
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:43,841
That'll keep everything out, eh,John?

509
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:47,917
- Something wrong,John?
- What?

510
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:50,043
You've been awfully quiet the last few days.

511
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:52,561
Oh, he's just mad that he missed all the action.

512
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:55,559
Ah, don't worry,John. You'll get your chance
to deal with the Indians.

513
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:59,322
Yeah, we'll take care of them like we did
last time, eh, mates?

514
00:41:59,407 --> 00:42:03,480
We shot ourselves an Injun or maybe two or three

515
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:06,035
All right, you howling nutter, get to work!

516
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:08,436
Come on, Ben. It's just a little fun.

517
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:11,280
Oh, sure, we're having loads of fun, right?

518
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:13,358
Look at us. No gold, no food.

519
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:17,725
While Ratcliffe sits up in his tent all day,
happy as a clam.

520
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:20,082
I am doomed!

521
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:24,558
I should be wallowing in riches by now and I haven't
found as much as a speck!

522
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:26,956
Think. Think!

523
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:31,518
It's got to be around here somewhere.
Where could it be?

524
00:42:33,327 --> 00:42:36,364
I've mined the forests and the hills and the swamps.

525
00:42:36,447 --> 00:42:38,278
And nothing!

526
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:44,166
Why can't I find it?
What am I overlooking?

527
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:47,882
I-- I--

528
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,798
I made it myself.

529
00:42:49,887 --> 00:42:52,082
Take that silly--

530
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:54,237
Of course! The Indians.

531
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:57,683
Wiggins, why do you think those
insolent heathens attacked us?

532
00:42:57,767 --> 00:43:00,918
Because we invaded their land and cut down 
their trees and dug up their earth?

533
00:43:01,007 --> 00:43:05,125
It's the gold! They have it and they don't
want us to take it from them.

534
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:09,086
Well, I'll just have to take it
by force, then, won't I?

535
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:13,686
You there!
Where's Captain Smith?

536
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:15,803
Well, he's gone.

537
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:18,162
Aye. Your singing must have scared them off.

538
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:21,557
- Well, then go get him, for heaven's sake!
- What if we run into the Indians?

539
00:43:21,647 --> 00:43:24,320
That's what guns are for.

540
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:26,557
Now arm yourselves and get moving!

541
00:43:51,007 --> 00:43:53,646
Pocahontas.

542
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,638
You should be inside the village.

543
00:43:55,727 --> 00:44:00,278
- We'll be all right.
- We're gathering food for when the warriors arrive.

544
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:04,804
- Don't go far. Now is not the time to be running off.
- Yes, Father.

545
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:08,522
When I see you wear that necklace...

546
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:10,962
you look just like your mother.

547
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:15,006
- I miss her.
- But she is still with us.

548
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:18,921
Whenever the wind moves through the trees,
I feel her presence.

549
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:21,919
Our people looked to her for wisdom and strength.

550
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:24,567
Someday, they will look to you as well.

551
00:44:24,647 --> 00:44:27,366
I would be honoured by that.

552
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:30,166
You shouldn't be out here alone.
I'll send for Kocoum.

553
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:33,244
- All right. What is it?
- What?

554
00:44:33,327 --> 00:44:35,966
- You're hiding something.
- I'm not hiding anything.

555
00:44:36,047 --> 00:44:39,039
Pocahontas, you can tell me.
I promise I won't tell anyone.

556
00:44:40,087 --> 00:44:41,998
Pocahontas, look!

557
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:48,802
- It's one of them! I'm going to get--
- What are you doing here?

558
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:50,798
- I had to see you again.
- Huh?

559
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:53,765
Pocahontas. Pocahontas?

560
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:57,681
- Please, don't say anything. Quick, this way.
- But--

561
00:44:57,767 --> 00:45:00,406
- Nakoma.
- Huh?
- Where is Pocahontas?

562
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:04,196
I-- I haven't seen her.

563
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:07,962
Pocahontas can't keep running off.
It's dangerous out there.

564
00:45:08,047 --> 00:45:11,244
Tell her that. She listens to you.

565
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,243
Huh. Sure she does.

566
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:32,637
This place is incredible.

567
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:35,685
And to think we came all this
way just to dig it up for gold.

568
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:37,723
- Gold?
- Hey, Meeko.

569
00:45:37,807 --> 00:45:41,516
- What's gold?
- You know, it's, uh-- it's, it's yellow.

570
00:45:41,607 --> 00:45:43,438
It comes out of the ground.
It's really valuable.

571
00:45:43,527 --> 00:45:47,679
Oh! Here, we have lots of it.
Gold.

572
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:51,237
No. Gold is this.

573
00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:53,921
Hmm. There's nothing like that around here.

574
00:45:54,007 --> 00:45:57,716
- No gold.
- Not that I've seen.

575
00:45:57,807 --> 00:46:01,925
All this way for nothing.
Well, those boys are in for a big surprise.

576
00:46:02,007 --> 00:46:04,157
- Will they leave?
- Some of them might.

577
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:11,004
- Will you go home?
- Well, it's not like I have much of a home to go back to.

578
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:13,396
I've never really belonged anywhere.

579
00:46:13,487 --> 00:46:16,081
You could belong here.

580
00:46:24,487 --> 00:46:27,081
- What was that?
- Did you see something?

581
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:30,000
No. No. I just, uh-- I--

582
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:33,045
I didn't see anything, did I?

583
00:46:33,127 --> 00:46:35,766
Look again.

584
00:46:35,847 --> 00:46:38,441
Let it break upon you

585
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:43,920
Like a wave upon the sand

586
00:46:44,007 --> 00:46:46,805
Hello, John Smith.

587
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,560
Pocahontas, that tree is talking to me.

588
00:46:49,647 --> 00:46:51,797
Then you should talk back.

589
00:46:51,887 --> 00:46:56,517
Don't be frightened, young man.
My bark is worse than my bite.

590
00:46:57,887 --> 00:47:01,277
- Say something.
- What do you say to a tree?

591
00:47:01,367 --> 00:47:03,927
Anything you want.

592
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:10,646
- So, uh--
- Come closer,John Smith.

593
00:47:11,847 --> 00:47:15,840
He has a good soul. And he's handsome too.

594
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:19,203
- Oh, I like her.
- I knew you would.

595
00:47:19,287 --> 00:47:22,518
Smith! Smith!
Where are you, mate?

596
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:25,075
- We can't let them see us.
- Quick! Over here.

597
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:28,842
This place gives me the creeps.
Savages could be hiding anywhere.

598
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:31,760
Aye. Well, if you spot one, don't ask questions.

599
00:47:31,847 --> 00:47:34,839
Just shoot.

600
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:38,476
- Watch your feet, you big oaf!
- It wasn't me. It was the tree.

601
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:41,957
Oh, of course! The tree
just felt like lifting its roots and--

602
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:47,642
Let's get out of here.

603
00:47:47,727 --> 00:47:49,558
- Ow!
- Ow! Run!

604
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:53,720
- But what about Smith?
- He's a big lad. He can take care of himself.

605
00:47:53,807 --> 00:47:58,005
- I'm glad you're on our side.
- There's still some snap in these old vines.

606
00:47:58,087 --> 00:48:00,647
I'd better get back before
they send the whole camp out after me.

607
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:04,561
- When will I see you again?
- Meet me tonight. Right here.

608
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:13,998
Well, I haven't had this much
excitement in 200 years.

609
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:19,002
What am I doing? I shouldn't be seeing him again.
I mean, I want to see him again.

610
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:21,999
Who wouldn't?
I want to see him again.

611
00:48:22,087 --> 00:48:25,841
But still, something inside is telling me
it's the right thing.

612
00:48:25,927 --> 00:48:29,044
- Perhaps it's your dream.
- My dream?

613
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:32,437
Do you think he's the one the
spinning arrow was pointing to?

614
00:48:32,527 --> 00:48:34,597
Hmm.

615
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:42,926
The warriors are here!

616
00:48:54,007 --> 00:48:56,680
Pocahontas, are you crazy?
What were you doing with one of them?

617
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,122
- There you are.
- Kocoum.
- Look at them.

618
00:48:59,207 --> 00:49:02,244
Now we have enough warriors
to destroy those white demons.

619
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,362
Now that we are joined by our brothers...

620
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:09,564
we will defeat this enemy.

621
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:18,559
- Father, I need to speak with you.
- Not now, my daughter.

622
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:23,118
- The council is gathering.
- We don't have to fight them!
There must be a better way.

623
00:49:23,207 --> 00:49:25,846
Sometimes our paths are chosen for us.

624
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:29,886
- But maybe we should try talking to them.
- They do not want to talk.

625
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:33,642
But if one of them did want to talk, you would
listen to him, wouldn't you?

626
00:49:33,727 --> 00:49:36,082
- Pocahontas.
- Wouldn't you?

627
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:39,716
Of course I would. But it is not that simple.

628
00:49:39,807 --> 00:49:42,719
Nothing is simple any more.

629
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,558
Easy, Thomas. It's me.

630
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:30,166
Oh,John. I could've killed you.

631
00:50:30,247 --> 00:50:33,683
Not aiming like that, you couldn't. 
Keep both eyes open when you shoot.

632
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:36,042
You'll see twice as well.

633
00:50:36,127 --> 00:50:39,836
- Smith, there you are!
- We were looking all over for you.

634
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:42,839
Smith! Where have you been?

635
00:50:42,927 --> 00:50:45,487
I was out scouting the terrain, sir.

636
00:50:45,567 --> 00:50:47,842
Excellent. Then you must know
the Indians' whereabouts.

637
00:50:47,927 --> 00:50:50,600
- We'll need that information for the battle.
- What battle?

638
00:50:50,687 --> 00:50:53,485
We will eliminate these savages once and for all.

639
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,683
No! You can't do that.

640
00:50:55,767 --> 00:50:57,678
Oh, can't I?

641
00:50:57,767 --> 00:51:00,235
Look, we don't have to fight them.

642
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:02,318
- John, what's gotten into you?
- I met one of them.

643
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:04,841
- You what?
- A savage?

644
00:51:04,927 --> 00:51:07,122
They're not savages.
They can help us.

645
00:51:07,207 --> 00:51:09,767
They know the land.
They know how to navigate the rivers.

646
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:13,761
- And look. It's food.
- What is it?

647
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:17,044
- It's better than hardtack and gruel, that's for sure.
- I like gruel.

648
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:19,482
They don't want to feed us, you ninnies!

649
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:22,035
They want to kill us, all of us!

650
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:25,039
They've got our gold, and they'll do anything
to keep it!

651
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:29,166
- But there is no gold.
- No gold?

652
00:51:29,247 --> 00:51:32,637
And I suppose your little
Indian friend told you this?

653
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:36,436
- Yes.
- Lies! Lies! All of it!

654
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:39,724
Murderous thieves!
There's no room for their kind in civilized society.

655
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:44,437
- But this is their land!
- This is my land! I make the laws here.

656
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:48,440
And I say anyone who so much
as looks at an Indian...

657
00:51:48,527 --> 00:51:51,678
without killing him on sight
will be tried for treason...

658
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:53,997
and hanged!

659
00:51:58,486 --> 00:52:00,477
- Pocahontas!
- Nakoma!

660
00:52:00,566 --> 00:52:03,126
Don't go out there.
I lied for you once.

661
00:52:03,206 --> 00:52:06,323
- Don't ask me to do it again.
- I have to do this.

662
00:52:06,406 --> 00:52:08,522
- He's one of them.
- You don't know him.

663
00:52:08,606 --> 00:52:11,484
If you go out there, you'll be turning your back
on your own people.

664
00:52:11,566 --> 00:52:13,796
I'm trying to help my people.

665
00:52:13,886 --> 00:52:17,356
Pocahontas, please.
You're my best friend.

666
00:52:17,446 --> 00:52:19,562
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I won't.

667
00:52:19,646 --> 00:52:22,444
- I know what I'm doing.
- Pocahontas, no !

668
00:52:28,886 --> 00:52:31,480
Ratcliffe wouldn't take us
halfway around the world for nothin'.

669
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:34,956
But what if Smith is right?
What if there is no gold?

670
00:52:35,046 --> 00:52:38,163
If you ask me, Ratcliffe's been lying to us
since we left London.

671
00:52:38,246 --> 00:52:40,043
Listen to you, ya bunch of idiots.

672
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:44,085
Those savages didn't attack us for nothin'.
They're hidin' somethin'.

673
00:52:44,166 --> 00:52:47,442
If they do have the gold,
I reckon we'll have to fight 'em.

674
00:52:47,526 --> 00:52:49,994
- Not me.
- Either too hot or too cool.

675
00:52:50,086 --> 00:52:52,281
I haven't been comfortable since we got here.

676
00:52:52,366 --> 00:52:56,882
Oh, I know.
I've been itching a lot.

677
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,155
- Follow him.
- Yes, Governor.

678
00:53:05,246 --> 00:53:08,204
- I want to know where he's sneaking off to.
- Yes, sir.

679
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:12,962
And if you happen to see any Indians, shoot them.

680
00:53:16,606 --> 00:53:21,726
Oh, and Thomas, you've been a slipshod sailor and
a poor excuse for a soldier.

681
00:53:21,806 --> 00:53:23,876
Don't disappoint me again.

682
00:53:33,606 --> 00:53:36,359
- Kocoum.
- What is it?

683
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:40,234
- It's Pocahontas.
- What's wrong? Is she all right?

684
00:53:42,206 --> 00:53:45,084
I think she's in trouble.

685
00:53:48,446 --> 00:53:51,358
The Earth is trembling, child.
What's happened?

686
00:53:51,446 --> 00:53:53,482
- The warriors are here!
- Pocahontas!

687
00:53:53,566 --> 00:53:55,761
John.

688
00:53:55,846 --> 00:53:59,555
Listen to me. My men are
planning to attack your people.

689
00:53:59,646 --> 00:54:03,002
- You've got to warn them.
- Maybe it's not too late to stop this.

690
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:05,042
You have to come with me
and talk to my father.

691
00:54:05,126 --> 00:54:07,560
Pocahontas, talking isn't
going to do any good.

692
00:54:07,646 --> 00:54:11,559
I already tried talking to my men, but 
everything about this land has them spooked.

693
00:54:15,966 --> 00:54:18,275
That's the strangest creature
I've ever seen.

694
00:54:22,686 --> 00:54:25,075
Percy.

695
00:54:26,326 --> 00:54:28,681
- Easy, Percy. Come here!
- Meeko, come back!

696
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,405
You see what I mean?
Once two sides want to fight, nothing can stop them.

697
00:54:31,486 --> 00:54:34,603
- Come-- Come here, both of you!
- It's all right! It's all right! He's a friend!

698
00:54:34,686 --> 00:54:36,836
Bad! Bad dog! Sit!

699
00:54:38,606 --> 00:54:40,562
- What are you doing? Meeko!
- Percy, get back here!

700
00:54:40,646 --> 00:54:44,525
- What are you doing? Stop that!
- All right, that's enough!

701
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:53,521
It's enough to make your sap boil.

702
00:54:55,006 --> 00:54:59,284
Now then, there's something
I want to show you. Look.

703
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:06,238
- The ripples.
- What about them?

704
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:10,558
So small at first, then look how they grow.

705
00:55:11,926 --> 00:55:15,077
But someone has to start them.

706
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:16,679
They're not going to listen to us.

707
00:55:16,766 --> 00:55:20,839
Young man, sometimes the right
path is not the easiest one.

708
00:55:20,926 --> 00:55:22,644
Don't you see?

709
00:55:22,726 --> 00:55:27,675
Only when the fighting stops can you be together.

710
00:55:30,606 --> 00:55:33,404
All right. Let's go talk to your father.

711
00:56:04,766 --> 00:56:06,643
No!

712
00:56:08,006 --> 00:56:10,201
Kocoum! No!

713
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:18,043
Kocoum!

714
00:56:21,046 --> 00:56:22,877
Leave him alone!

715
00:56:38,006 --> 00:56:39,997
Kocoum! Stop!

716
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:44,356
Both eyes open.

717
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,078
Thomas!

718
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:56,680
- Is he--
- You killed him.

719
00:56:56,766 --> 00:56:58,597
- I thought that--
- Get away from him!

720
00:56:58,686 --> 00:57:01,883
- Pocahontas, it won't help! He was only--
- He killed him!

721
00:57:04,806 --> 00:57:07,366
Thomas, get out of here!

722
00:57:07,446 --> 00:57:09,277
Get out of here!

723
00:58:09,806 --> 00:58:13,242
- Who did this?
- Pocahontas was out in the woods.

724
00:58:13,326 --> 00:58:15,999
Kocoum went to find her
and this white man attacked him.

725
00:58:17,726 --> 00:58:22,641
Your weapons are strong,
but now our anger is stronger.

726
00:58:22,726 --> 00:58:26,605
- At sunrise he will be the first to die.
- But, Father--

727
00:58:26,686 --> 00:58:29,598
I told you to stay in the village.

728
00:58:29,686 --> 00:58:33,315
You disobeyed me. You have shamed your father!

729
00:58:33,406 --> 00:58:35,078
I was only trying to help.

730
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:38,954
Because of your foolishness,
Kocoum is dead!

731
00:58:39,046 --> 00:58:41,196
Take him away!

732
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:57,002
Kocoum was just coming to protect me.

733
00:58:57,086 --> 00:59:00,840
Pocahontas, I sent Kocoum after you.

734
00:59:02,766 --> 00:59:04,677
I was worried about you.

735
00:59:04,766 --> 00:59:06,996
I-I thought I was doing the right thing.

736
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:10,123
All this happened because of me.

737
00:59:10,206 --> 00:59:13,004
And now I'll never see John Smith again.

738
00:59:15,046 --> 00:59:16,923
Come with me.

739
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:24,839
Pocahontas wants to look into the eyes 
of the man who killed Kocoum.

740
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,437
Be quick.

741
00:59:46,686 --> 00:59:48,324
Pocahontas.

742
00:59:50,646 --> 00:59:53,956
- I'm so sorry.
- For what, this?

743
00:59:54,046 --> 00:59:58,119
I've gotten out of worse scrapes than this. 
Can't think of any right now, but--

744
00:59:58,206 --> 01:00:01,915
It would've been better if we'd never met.
None of this would've happened.

745
01:00:02,006 --> 01:00:04,804
Pocahontas, look at me.

746
01:00:04,886 --> 01:00:07,354
I'd rather die tomorrow...

747
01:00:07,446 --> 01:00:10,597
than live a hundred years without knowing you.

748
01:00:10,686 --> 01:00:12,324
Pocahontas.

749
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:15,204
- I can't leave you.
- You never will.

750
01:00:15,286 --> 01:00:19,802
No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be with you. Forever.

751
01:00:32,286 --> 01:00:35,562
Help! Somebody help!
Help! Help!

752
01:00:35,646 --> 01:00:38,718
- Easy, lad. What is it?
- It's Smith! They got him!

753
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:40,478
- Who got him?
- The savages!

754
01:00:40,566 --> 01:00:42,921
- Savages?
- They captured him, dragged him off!

755
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,644
- Where'd they take him?
- They headed north.

756
01:00:44,726 --> 01:00:46,717
- How many were there?
- I don't know. At least a dozen.

757
01:00:46,806 --> 01:00:48,956
- Filthy beasts!
- Ratcliffe was right!

758
01:00:49,046 --> 01:00:52,675
It's perfect, Wiggins.
I couldn't have planned this better myself.

759
01:00:52,766 --> 01:00:55,678
The gold is as good as mine.

760
01:00:55,766 --> 01:00:58,405
We've got to save him!
He'd do the same for any of us!

761
01:00:58,486 --> 01:01:01,637
- Thomas is right! We've got to do somethin'!
- And so we shall.

762
01:01:01,806 --> 01:01:05,435
- I told you those savages couldn't be trusted.
- That's right!

763
01:01:05,526 --> 01:01:08,518
Smith tried to befriend them,
and look what they've done to him!

764
01:01:08,606 --> 01:01:12,485
- Yeah, that's right.
- But now I say it's time to rescue our courageous comrade.

765
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:16,081
At daybreak, we attack!

766
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:19,317
What can you expect from filthy little heathens

767
01:01:19,406 --> 01:01:22,443
- Here's what you get when races are diverse
- That's right.

768
01:01:22,526 --> 01:01:25,802
Their skins are hellish red
They're only good when dead

769
01:01:25,886 --> 01:01:28,639
They're vermin, as I said and worse

770
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:32,560
- They're savages, savages
- Barely even human

771
01:01:32,646 --> 01:01:35,843
- Savages, savages
- Drive them from our shore

772
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:39,077
They're not like you and me
which means they must be evil

773
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:41,919
We must sound the drums of war

774
01:01:42,006 --> 01:01:45,681
They're savages, savages
Dirty shrieking devils

775
01:01:45,766 --> 01:01:49,281
Now we sound the drums of war

776
01:01:53,886 --> 01:01:57,242
This is what we feared
The paleface is a demon

777
01:01:57,326 --> 01:02:00,318
The only thing they feel at all is greed

778
01:02:00,406 --> 01:02:03,716
Beneath that milky hide there's empatiness inside

779
01:02:03,806 --> 01:02:06,445
I wonder if they even bleed

780
01:02:06,526 --> 01:02:10,314
- They're savages, savages
- Barely even human

781
01:02:10,406 --> 01:02:13,318
- Savages, savages
- Killers at the core

782
01:02:13,406 --> 01:02:17,035
They're different from us
which means they can't be trusted

783
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:19,879
We must sound the drums of war

784
01:02:19,966 --> 01:02:23,561
- They're savages, savages
- First we deal with this one

785
01:02:23,646 --> 01:02:26,718
- Then we sound the drums of war
- Savages, savages

786
01:02:26,806 --> 01:02:28,398
Let's go get a few, men!

787
01:02:28,486 --> 01:02:31,762
- Savages, savages
- Now it's up to you, men

788
01:02:31,846 --> 01:02:33,484
- Savages
- Savages

789
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:35,204
Barely even human

790
01:02:35,286 --> 01:02:38,562
Now we sound the drums

791
01:02:38,646 --> 01:02:40,079
Of

792
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:46,719
War

793
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:54,244
- They're going to kill him at sunrise, Grandmother Willow.
- You have to stop them.

794
01:02:54,326 --> 01:02:57,762
- I can't.
- Child, remember your dream.

795
01:02:57,846 --> 01:03:01,475
I was wrong, Grandmother Willow.
I followed the wrong path.

796
01:03:01,566 --> 01:03:03,875
I feel so lost.

797
01:03:20,406 --> 01:03:22,556
The compass?

798
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:31,877
Spinning arrow.

799
01:03:31,966 --> 01:03:34,116
It's the arrow from your dream.

800
01:03:34,206 --> 01:03:37,357
I was right!
It was pointing to him.

801
01:03:43,606 --> 01:03:46,200
- Sunrise.
- It's not too late, child.

802
01:03:46,286 --> 01:03:50,074
Let the spirits of the Earth guide you.

803
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:53,475
You know your path, child.

804
01:03:53,566 --> 01:03:55,716
Now follow it!

805
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:00,564
This will be the day

806
01:04:00,646 --> 01:04:02,443
Let's go, men!

807
01:04:03,486 --> 01:04:06,159
This will be the morning

808
01:04:06,246 --> 01:04:08,555
Bring out the prisoner!

809
01:04:08,646 --> 01:04:10,284
We will see them dying in the dust

810
01:04:10,366 --> 01:04:13,483
I don't know what I can do
Still, I know I've got to try

811
01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:16,683
- Now we make 'em paay
- Eagle, helpa my feet to fly

812
01:04:16,766 --> 01:04:20,042
- Now, without a warning
- Mountain, help my heart be great

813
01:04:20,126 --> 01:04:21,559
Now we leave 'em blood and bone and rust

814
01:04:21,646 --> 01:04:25,195
- Spirits of the Earth and sky
- lt's them or us

815
01:04:25,286 --> 01:04:27,720
- Please don't let it be too late
- They're just a bunch of

816
01:04:27,806 --> 01:04:30,957
- Filthy, stinking savages
- Savages

817
01:04:31,046 --> 01:04:32,525
- Demon
- Devil
- Kill them!

818
01:04:32,606 --> 01:04:35,404
- Savages, savages
- What are we waiting for

819
01:04:35,486 --> 01:04:38,922
Destroy their evil race
until there's not a trace left

820
01:04:39,006 --> 01:04:41,474
- How loud
- We will sound the drums of war

821
01:04:41,566 --> 01:04:45,320
- Are the drums of war
- Now we sound the drums of war

822
01:04:45,406 --> 01:04:48,557
- Now we see what comes of trying to be chums
- Now we sound the drums

823
01:04:48,646 --> 01:04:53,481
- Is the death of all I love carried in the drumming of
- Of

824
01:04:53,566 --> 01:04:55,204
- War
- No!

825
01:04:59,046 --> 01:05:02,118
If you kill him, you'll have to kill me too.

826
01:05:02,206 --> 01:05:04,401
Daughter, stand back.

827
01:05:04,486 --> 01:05:08,274
I won't! I love him, Father.

828
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:12,003
What?

829
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:19,034
Look around you.
This is where the path of hatred has brought us.

830
01:05:21,646 --> 01:05:25,355
This is the path I choose,
Father. What will yours be?

831
01:05:58,526 --> 01:06:02,599
My daughter speaks with
a wisdom beyond her years.

832
01:06:02,686 --> 01:06:05,723
We have all come here with anger in our hearts...

833
01:06:05,806 --> 01:06:09,640
but she comes with courage and understanding.

834
01:06:09,726 --> 01:06:13,639
From this day forward,
if there is to be more killing...

835
01:06:13,726 --> 01:06:15,876
it will not start with me.

836
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:21,282
Release him.

837
01:06:37,886 --> 01:06:39,717
Now's our chance! Fire!

838
01:06:39,806 --> 01:06:41,478
- No!
- What?

839
01:06:41,566 --> 01:06:44,160
- They let him go.
- They don't want to fight.

840
01:06:44,246 --> 01:06:47,158
It's a trick! Don't you see?
Fire!

841
01:06:52,126 --> 01:06:54,924
Fine. I'll settle this myself.

842
01:06:56,126 --> 01:06:58,435
No!

843
01:06:58,526 --> 01:06:59,641
John!

844
01:07:05,366 --> 01:07:09,917
- You shot him!
- He stepped right-- right into it. It's his own fault.

845
01:07:10,006 --> 01:07:12,440
- Smith was right all along.
- We never should've listened to you.

846
01:07:12,526 --> 01:07:14,756
- Get the gun!
- Traitors!

847
01:07:14,846 --> 01:07:16,677
Unhand me, I say!
How dare you!

848
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:20,998
- Put him in chains!
- I'll see you all hanged for this!

849
01:07:21,086 --> 01:07:22,917
And gag him as well!

850
01:07:34,566 --> 01:07:37,956
- Is he gonna make it, Thomas?
- The sooner he gets back to England, the better.

851
01:07:38,046 --> 01:07:40,844
- Well, let's hope the wind is with him.
- Is the ship ready yet?

852
01:07:40,926 --> 01:07:44,680
Any minute now.Just loadin'
the last bit of cargo.

853
01:07:47,126 --> 01:07:49,799
How dare you!
Untie me at once!

854
01:07:49,886 --> 01:07:52,559
I'll have your heads for this!

855
01:07:52,646 --> 01:07:55,160
And he came so highly recommended.

856
01:08:03,966 --> 01:08:08,198
The ship's almost ready.
We'd better get you on board.
We'll lose the tide.

857
01:08:08,286 --> 01:08:09,924
No, not yet.

858
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:13,078
- She said she'd be here.
- Look.

859
01:08:38,966 --> 01:08:43,198
Going back is his only chance.
He'll die if he stays here.

860
01:08:51,726 --> 01:08:55,799
Here. It's from Grandmother Willow's bark.

861
01:08:55,886 --> 01:08:57,842
It'll help with the pain.

862
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:00,838
What pain? I've had worse pain than this.

863
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:04,964
Can't think of any right now, but--

864
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,244
You are always welcome among our people.

865
01:09:13,326 --> 01:09:15,760
Thank you, my brother.

866
01:09:18,926 --> 01:09:20,757
I thought you didn't like strangers.

867
01:09:29,446 --> 01:09:31,323
My mother's necklace.

868
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:36,923
See ya, Percy.

869
01:09:53,086 --> 01:09:54,439
Come with me?

870
01:09:58,726 --> 01:10:01,081
You must choose your own path.

871
01:10:16,286 --> 01:10:17,958
I'm needed here.

872
01:10:19,286 --> 01:10:21,322
Then I'll stay with you.

873
01:10:21,406 --> 01:10:24,762
No. You have to go back.

874
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:28,156
- But I can't leave you.
- You never will.

875
01:10:28,246 --> 01:10:32,524
No matter what happens,
I'll always be with you.

876
01:10:32,606 --> 01:10:34,597
Forever.

877
01:10:59,886 --> 01:11:02,354
- Good luck, lad.
- Godspeed,John.

878
01:11:08,566 --> 01:11:10,716
- The crew a-ready?
- Aye, sir!

879
01:11:10,806 --> 01:11:12,637
Set the mainsails!

880
01:11:15,126 --> 01:11:18,436
Weigh anchor!

881
01:11:18,526 --> 01:11:21,882
- Let go of the topgallants!
- Aye, sir!

882
01:12:38,326 --> 01:12:42,444
lf I never knew you

883
01:12:42,526 --> 01:12:46,724
lf I never felt this love

884
01:12:46,806 --> 01:12:50,719
I would have no inkling of

885
01:12:50,806 --> 01:12:55,482
How precious life can be

886
01:12:55,566 --> 01:12:59,525
And I'm so grateful to you

887
01:12:59,606 --> 01:13:03,645
I'd have lived my whole life through

888
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:06,160
Lost forever

889
01:13:06,246 --> 01:13:12,276
lf I never knew you

890
01:13:14,526 --> 01:13:18,758
lf I never knew you

891
01:13:18,846 --> 01:13:22,964
I'd be safe but half as real

892
01:13:23,046 --> 01:13:26,925
Never knowing I could feel

893
01:13:27,006 --> 01:13:31,557
A love so strong and true

894
01:13:31,646 --> 01:13:37,801
- Oh, if I never knew you
- There's no moment I'd regret

895
01:13:37,886 --> 01:13:42,596
- lf I never knew your love
- Since the moment that we met

896
01:13:42,686 --> 01:13:45,962
- I would have no inkling of
- lf our time has gone too fast

897
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:52,201
- How precious life can be
- I've lived at last

898
01:13:53,246 --> 01:13:55,077
Yeah, yeah

899
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:59,799
I thought our love would be so beautiful

900
01:13:59,886 --> 01:14:01,080
So beautiful

901
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:05,603
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright

902
01:14:05,686 --> 01:14:09,838
I thought our love would be so beautiful

903
01:14:09,926 --> 01:14:13,635
We'd turn the darkness into light

904
01:14:13,726 --> 01:14:18,641
And still my heart is saying we were right

905
01:14:18,726 --> 01:14:20,284
We were right

906
01:14:20,366 --> 01:14:24,882
- And if I never knew you
- lf I never knew you

907
01:14:24,966 --> 01:14:30,199
I'd have lived my whole life through

908
01:14:30,286 --> 01:14:34,438
Empty as the sky

909
01:14:34,526 --> 01:14:40,203
Never knowing why

910
01:14:40,286 --> 01:14:42,959
Lost forever

911
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:47,801
If I never knew

912
01:14:47,886 --> 01:14:52,880
You

913
01:14:54,886 --> 01:14:57,195
Yeah

914
01:15:12,766 --> 01:15:18,204
You think you own whatever land you land on

915
01:15:18,286 --> 01:15:23,565
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim

916
01:15:23,646 --> 01:15:28,515
But I know every rock and tree and creature

917
01:15:28,606 --> 01:15:31,757
Has a life, has a spirit

918
01:15:31,846 --> 01:15:34,724
Has a name

919
01:15:34,806 --> 01:15:40,039
You think the only people
who are people

920
01:15:40,126 --> 01:15:45,484
Are the people who look
and think like you

921
01:15:45,566 --> 01:15:50,845
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger

922
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:56,159
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

923
01:15:56,246 --> 01:15:59,124
Have you ever heard the wolf cry

924
01:15:59,206 --> 01:16:01,879
To the blue corn moon

925
01:16:01,966 --> 01:16:07,120
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been

926
01:16:07,206 --> 01:16:12,917
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain

927
01:16:13,006 --> 01:16:18,364
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind

928
01:16:18,446 --> 01:16:24,282
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind

929
01:16:24,366 --> 01:16:29,394
How high does the sycamore grow

930
01:16:29,486 --> 01:16:31,920
lf you cut it down

931
01:16:32,006 --> 01:16:37,364
Then you'll never know

932
01:16:37,446 --> 01:16:40,677
And you'll never hear the wolf cry

933
01:16:40,766 --> 01:16:43,405
To the blue corn moon

934
01:16:43,486 --> 01:16:48,241
For whether we are white or copapaer-skinned

935
01:16:48,326 --> 01:16:54,196
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain

936
01:16:54,286 --> 01:16:59,838
We need to paint with all the colours of the wind

937
01:16:59,926 --> 01:17:02,440
You can own the Earth and still

938
01:17:02,526 --> 01:17:06,599
All you'll own is earth until

939
01:17:06,686 --> 01:17:10,998
You can paint with all the colours

940
01:17:11,086 --> 01:17:12,917
Of

941
01:17:13,006 --> 01:17:17,841
The wind

942
