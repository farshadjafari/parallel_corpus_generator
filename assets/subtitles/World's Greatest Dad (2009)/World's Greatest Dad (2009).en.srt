1
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,487
Man's voice:
My name is Lance clayton.

2
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,699
My biggest fear in life is
that I'm going to end up all alone.

3
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,160
I'm a writer.

4
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,996
I'm a writer, but so far
nothing I've written

5
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,540
has ever been published.

6
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,042
Ernest Hemingway
once said

7
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,587
all he wanted to do was
write one true sentence.

8
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,131
He also tried to scratch
an itch on the back of his head

9
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,632
with a shotgun.

10
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,431
I've always dreamed
of being a famous author,

11
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,767
of creating
an important work...

12
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,728
# Ooh la la la la la la la #

13
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,354
# La la la la la la #

14
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,939
# Saa la la la la
la la la... #

15
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,150
...something that connected
with people and helped them

16
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,778
as they suffered through
the human condition...

17
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,279
# Ooh la la la... #

18
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,157
...also something that made
a shitload of cash.

19
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,288
# Ooh la la la la la... #

20
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,377
I've written novels,
books, magazine articles,

21
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,171
and even
children's stories.

22
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,216
All have been rejected.

23
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,803
I did sell a few
greeting cards once, though.

24
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,931
It felt pretty good.

25
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,474
I don't find
the creative process

26
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,768
in itself rewarding enough.

27
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,855
I have to be honest...
I want to reach an audience.

28
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,358
This is my fifth novel.

29
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,569
I've promised myself that
if this one is rejected,

30
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,404
I'll give up writing.

31
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,294
Come on, boy, we're late.

32
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,048
Hey, buddy, I...

33
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,591
Kyle?

34
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,802
Oh, fuc...
what the fuck?

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,847
- God! Kyle?
- D-Dad?

36
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,015
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

37
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,519
- God, I was coming, you fag!
- Jesus christ.

38
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,771
- I thought you were dead.
- Do you knock? Please!

39
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,481
I knocked.
Okay, yep.

40
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,525
- Out!
- God, I...

41
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,527
- Get out of my room!
- I'm out. I'm going.

42
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,654
- I'm out of here.
- You ever heard of privacy?

43
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,531
- You freak!
- Yeah, I'm the weird one.

44
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,533
Yeah. Oh, God.

45
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,910
What the fuck?

46
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:54,840
Dad?

47
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,467
- Dad!
- Oh, yeah. Right.

48
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,516
Radio: # What do you do?
Where do you go? #

49
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,689
You were up early.

50
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,985
- You're not funny.
- Okay.

51
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,154
What a Monday.

52
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,200
# Somewhere else... #

53
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,493
Why are we
listening to this?

54
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,662
'Cause I like
Bruce Hornsby.

55
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,838
Stop it.

56
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,926
Bruce Hornsby is a fag.

57
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,595
- He's got kids, Kyle.
- You have a kid.

58
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,096
- Mmm.
- And you're a fag.

59
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,599
- Why? Because I like Bruce Hornsby?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,184
Well, put on some music
you like. Okay?

61
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,685
No, I fucking hate music.

62
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,187
- You hate music?
- Yeah.

63
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,606
- All music?
- Yes.

64
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,776
The only thing queerer than music
are the people who like it.

65
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,445
All music is gay now?
What about heavy metal?

66
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:02,449
That's probably the faggiest
of all the fag music out there.

67
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,618
Kyle, you could have
died this morning.

68
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,621
Well...
of embarrassment.

69
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,581
What you're doing
is dangerous.

70
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,708
What? Beating off?

71
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,628
No no... not...
we all have needs, Kyle.

72
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,213
Needs? What...
what are you talking about?

73
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,714
Masturbation is natural, okay?

74
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,299
- You know what's not natural?
- What?

75
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,219
Talking about jerking off
with your dad. That's not natural.

76
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,720
- Shit.
- Don't do that, please, okay?

77
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,306
- Why?
- Because your feet are dirty.

78
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,768
Because I said so.

79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,322
- Whoa, let me out here.
- Let me park in the lot.

80
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,617
Lance, I'm gonna look like a dillweed
walking in with you, all right?

81
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,452
It's bad for my rep.

82
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,037
Don't call me Lance.

83
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,957
It's your name,
isn't it? Lance?

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,377
# What do you do?
Where do you go? #

85
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,713
# What do you say? #

86
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,340
# And how do you know? #

87
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,759
# I'll say who cares #

88
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,761
# When people stare #

89
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:09,016
# I will make myself
invisible #

90
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,561
# Yes, I will, yes, I will #

91
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:17,107
# Mm-hmm #

92
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,067
# Mm-hmm hmm... #

93
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,320
Slow down, boys.

94
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,822
# When I feel like a freak... #

95
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,574
'Morning.

96
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:30,287
# When I'm on the other end
of someone's mean streak #

97
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,749
# People make fun,
I've got to lose myself... #

98
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,250
Danny.

99
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,338
# Take my thin skin
and move it somewhere else #

100
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:43,008
# I'm setting myself up
for the future #

101
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:48,138
# Looking for the chance that something
good might lie ahead #

102
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,351
# I guess I'm looking
for the possibilities #

103
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,894
# And in my mind #

104
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,147
# I've got this skin
I can shed... #

105
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,774
# What do you do? #

106
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,275
# Where do you go? #

107
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,694
- Good morning, Lance.
- 'Morning Principal Anderson.

108
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,613
- What was that?
- Oh, personal mail,

109
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,239
but I used
my own postage.

110
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,450
- Mmm. Good.
- Right.

111
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,369
May I speak with you
for a moment?

112
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,162
Sure.

113
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,539
Your poetry course...

114
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,375
it's not very popular.

115
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,960
- Neither is poetry, sir.
- Mmm.

116
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,171
But the few who take it,
they get a lot out of it.

117
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,131
Yes yes,
I'm sure they do.

118
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,384
But I am sorry...
if your class enrollment

119
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,178
doesn't improve by next semester,
we're going to have to drop it.

120
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,639
We're only budgeted
for one English elective,

121
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,184
and Mike Lane's creative-writing
course is quite the hit.

122
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,311
I just wanted to give you
a heads up.

123
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,896
Well, thank you, sir.

124
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,193
- Hey, what's going on, Mr. L?
- Hey, how you doin', man?

125
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,736
- Good. How are you?
- Ready for tonight's game?

126
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,238
- Yeah, you gonna be there?
- I'll be there. Of course.

127
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,948
- Good.
- Throw a touchdown for me, all right?

128
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,950
- Of course!
- Hey, Lancelot!

129
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,743
- What's up, buddy?
- Not much, Mike.

130
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,870
All right.

131
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,914
'Morning, Miss Reed.

132
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,999
- Hello, Mr. Clayton.
- How are you?

133
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,293
- Good. How are you?
- Mmm.

134
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,465
Ahh, my favorite.

135
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,467
I thought teachers weren't
supposed to have favorites.

136
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,302
Not favorite students.

137
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,269
I'm a lucky guy.

138
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,354
How does a lump like me
get a dame like you?

139
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,857
Don't insult my taste.
I'm the lucky guy.

140
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,778
You finished?

141
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,364
Yeah. I wanted you to be
the first to read it.

142
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,532
I'm honored.

143
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,867
Really?

144
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,244
Maybe I'll take you
someplace fancy for dinner.

145
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,247
How about you come over to my place
for something hot and spicy?

146
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,291
- Is that a double entendre?
- No.

147
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,876
- I was just going to make you my chili.
- Oh.

148
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,210
And then bang you.

149
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,504
Great!

150
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,548
You have a very
professional day, Miss Reed.

151
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,008
Right back at you,
Mr. Clayton.

152
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,886
- Take care.
- Extremely professional day.

153
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,516
Andrew, I want
to show you something.

154
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,019
What is it?

155
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,229
Ew, is that woman
being crapped on?

156
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,690
Happy birthday.
It's fucking German schizer porn.

157
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,901
All right, dude?
It's fucking hot, right, yo?

158
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,445
No, dude, what the fuck
is wrong with you, yo?

159
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,113
Nothing.

160
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,616
You wouldn't say that
if you lived in Europe.

161
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,035
I mean, these Europeans
are much more broadminded

162
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,787
than these uptight Americans.
Shit's huge in Germany.

163
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,707
Yeah, well, we're not in Europe
and I don't like that kind of stuff.

164
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,001
Yeah, I know,
that's 'cause you're a fag.

165
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,836
Dude, it's gross.

166
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,172
I'd do it...

167
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,673
to someone.

168
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,342
- Oh.
- I would.

169
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,844
I'd chili-dog her.

170
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,680
Hi, Jennifer.

171
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,684
Come on, baby,
that pussy's not gonna eat itself.

172
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,686
What the fuck
did you just say?

173
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,356
Uh, nothing.

174
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,608
You're a fucking pig.

175
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,653
Wow, okay.

176
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,530
Hold that.

177
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,916
Get off me, you dumb jock!

178
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,168
What are you talking about?
I don't even play sports.

179
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,753
- You...
- Hey!

180
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,839
Come on, guys, knock it off.
Knock it off.

181
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,592
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right, bitch.

182
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,096
Oh, you're gonna help me up?

183
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,100
- Come on.
- Can't you control that animal?

184
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,562
Now come on,
tough guy, let's go.

185
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,564
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

186
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,693
Principal: Kyle,

187
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,361
what did you say
to Jennifer?

188
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,613
Nothing.

189
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,701
He said that her pussy
is not going to eat itself.

190
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,411
Do you hear that?

191
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,329
You are... that is rude.

192
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,164
- And you're a pervert.
- Be quiet.

193
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,083
Kyle, is that
what you said?

194
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,669
No.

195
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,963
Jennifer, chris,
get back to class.

196
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,799
Kyle, I need to speak
with you and your father.

197
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,395
Kyle, right now you're
on academic probation

198
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,731
and your grades show
no sign of improvement.

199
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,316
If you don't straighten up,

200
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,526
I'm going
to have to expel you.

201
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,863
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Mr. Anderson.

202
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,198
I do understand.

203
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,577
Now get out of here.
And no more trouble.

204
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,079
Wait for me outside.

205
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,088
Lance,

206
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,090
this isn't easy for me.

207
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,967
What isn't easy,
Mr. Anderson?

208
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,677
How's Kyle been acting
at home?

209
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,930
I mean, does he seem
normal to you?

210
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,933
Oh, yeah.

211
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,561
Oh. You and I both know
that sometimes

212
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,105
these things take
a long time to surface.

213
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,940
What things?

214
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,610
Well, I think that Kyle's
poor grades and acting out

215
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,737
show signs of a serious
development problem.

216
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,781
He belongs in
a special-needs school

217
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,492
where he can get the proper attention
and care that he requires.

218
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,160
- What?
- That's nothing to be ashamed of.

219
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,163
Sir, he's... he's not slow.

220
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,748
He's just being a pain.

221
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,291
Give him another chance.

222
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,960
Well, I have.
I've given him many chances.

223
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,463
That's true.

224
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,517
All right.

225
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,312
All right, but he'd better start showing
signs of improvement and quickly.

226
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,940
And he's got to stop
disturbing the other students.

227
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,275
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

228
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,194
Thank you.

229
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,823
- You're grounded.
- I'll run away.

230
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,491
Oh, and live
with your mother?

231
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,159
And her boy-toy Todd?
That's a great idea.

232
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,869
- I'll take away your computer.
- No, you won't.

233
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,163
Yes, I will.
Jesus christ, Kyle,

234
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,290
what did I do
to deserve this?

235
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,209
I didn't ask to be born.

236
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,003
Neither did I.

237
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,089
Boo hoo.

238
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,551
Woman:
You are so funny!

239
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,053
Wait, read from here.
Starting there.

240
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,347
- What are you reading?
- "We don't experience it

241
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,724
as a restriction!"

242
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,144
- What's that?
- Oh, God, you are so funny.

243
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,146
It's... come here.
Give it to me.

244
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,398
- Oh, this is embarrassing.
- Mike got published

245
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,316
- in "The New Yorker. "
- "New Yorker"!

246
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,901
- Hello!
- "The New Yorker"?

247
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,362
Woman: It's about
the first robot that joins the NBA.

248
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,407
- It's like a parody about racism.
- Miss Reed: Racism.

249
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,576
- It's hysterical.
- No, it isn't.

250
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,203
No, it is seriously so good.

251
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,247
Called "I, Forward. "
Get it?

252
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,583
Yeah, like "I, Robot. "

253
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,418
- Right, but "I, Forward. "
- Yeah.

254
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,587
It's... it's really hard
getting in "The New Yorker. "

255
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,005
- It is?
- Yeah, really.

256
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,506
It's the first thing
I submitted.

257
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,258
Woman: That's amaz...
I'm amazed.

258
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,427
The first thing? No.

259
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,555
- That's great. Good for you.
- What's that?

260
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,474
Mike got published
in "The New Yorker. "

261
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,267
You don't say!
May I see it?

262
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,144
- Sure.
- It's about racism.

263
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,938
Hot dog! Now don't go
getting too famous on us.

264
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,690
What's that?

265
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,484
Mike published an article
in "The New Yorker. "

266
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,652
- Take a look at that.
- Ho ho!

267
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,280
Right on.
You dog, you dog!

268
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,491
Yeah!

269
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,284
This should be read
at assembly.

270
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,786
Now that is a great idea.

271
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,621
Mike, would you read it
at the assembly?

272
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,498
If you twist my arm,
all right.

273
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,167
May I take this
with me?

274
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,835
- Yeah, sure.
- Can I read it after him?

275
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,295
That's awesome.
Congratulations.

276
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,963
Hey, blow my whistle.
Come on... "The New Yorker"!

277
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,216
For "The New Yorker"!
Yeah!

278
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,472
Wow, I cannot wait
to get my own copy.

279
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,518
"New Yorker. "
It's not a national,

280
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,145
- but that's amazing.
- No.

281
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,272
Actually, it is
a national magazine.

282
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,774
- It's national.
- Really?

283
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,609
Whoa, I didn't know that.

284
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,777
Mmm.

285
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,986
How's Kyle?

286
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,988
Great.

287
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,366
Raising a son is so hard.

288
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,410
Don't get me wrong, my Hunter is
the best thing that ever happened to me.

289
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,579
But man, can he be a handful.

290
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,832
- How old is he?
- Two, going on 20.

291
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,458
Oh, God.

292
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,709
The kid's a player.

293
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,336
Well, I wonder where
he gets that from.

294
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,421
I have no idea.

295
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,674
How's he dealing
with the separation?

296
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,592
Real well.

297
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,095
I didn't know
you were separated.

298
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,097
Yeah.
It's been tough,

299
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,767
but his mother and I were supposed
to make a baby together.

300
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,061
We just weren't supposed
to live together.

301
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,230
- That's so sad.
- Yeah.

302
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,440
Thanks.

303
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,110
How often do you see him?

304
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,987
Every other weekend.

305
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,073
They're not kidding when
they say that raising a child

306
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,826
is the toughest job
you'll ever love.

307
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,495
Mmm. Well, you sound
like a great dad.

308
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,873
Ah, well,

309
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,916
I try my best.

310
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,015
Hi, Andrew.

311
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,683
Hey.

312
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,185
I enjoy our little chats.

313
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,480
Woman's voice:
Oh, yeah.

314
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,900
- Kyle?
- Hi... hi, Dad.

315
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,485
- What are you doing?
- What? Nothing.

316
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,195
What's Andrew doing here?

317
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,240
What, Andr... don't bother
Andrew, all right? He has asthma.

318
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,034
Then he shouldn't be
having milk products.

319
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,703
- What?
- Listen, you're grounded.

320
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,081
- Send him home.
- I can't send him home, Dad!

321
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,833
God, man, you never
listen to me.

322
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,585
I told you,
he doesn't have a father

323
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,337
and he has a mother
who's an alcoholic.

324
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,172
Kyle, send him home. You don't get
to have friends over.

325
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,174
Fine, you know what?
You can send him home.

326
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,217
I'm not gonna do that
to this guy.

327
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,762
Okay? You don't care about
anyone but yourself.

328
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,430
- Kyle?
- You're so... what?

329
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,391
- What do you want?
- Do you want to do some homework?

330
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,477
I would love to, but I can't.

331
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,103
You have to go home.

332
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,647
Why?

333
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,524
Oh, well, that's a question
for my father.

334
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,568
Fine, Andrew can stay.
You can do homework.

335
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,945
Oh, you can stay now!
You can...

336
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,404
go on, get in. Shut up.

337
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,323
Oh, you're gonna tell me
to shut up now.

338
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,033
- Yeah, I am.
- Prick.

339
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,870
Mr. Clayton, do you
have anything to eat?

340
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,705
Sure, Andrew.

341
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,000
Uh, I'm a vegetarian.

342
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,423
Here you go, Andrew.
It's just cheese.

343
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,883
I hope you're okay
with that.

344
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,677
- Be careful. It's hot.
- Thanks, Mr. Clayton.

345
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,220
Kyle, let's see
how much you've got here.

346
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,848
Oh, online. Well,
"Farmers relied on good soil,

347
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,226
worker animals,
sunshine and...

348
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,644
perspiration. "

349
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,229
You mean like sweat?

350
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,940
No, perspiration...
when it rains!

351
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,067
Uh, that's...
that's precipitation.

352
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,111
No, I meant "sweat. "

353
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,445
Oh.

354
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,823
It's hot. You want
something to drink, Andrew?

355
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,949
No.

356
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,242
You okay?

357
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,868
I'm trying to write.

358
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,453
- Sorry.
- Please.

359
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,455
Hello?

360
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,832
- Lance: Hey.
- Hi.

361
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,126
As soon as I finish helping Kyle
with his homework,

362
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,462
I'm coming over to your house
and putting my penis in your vagina.

363
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,799
That's a single entendre.

364
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,801
Oh, I should have
called you earlier.

365
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,178
I didn't get to the store
so I didn't make chili.

366
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,848
Oh. Well, I'll
take you out to dinner.

367
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,558
Oh, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

368
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,560
I mean, we really shouldn't go out
where students might see us.

369
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,479
Well, you know what? I'll pick up
some takeout and bring it over.

370
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,650
Oh, would you just hate me
if we did this tomorrow night instead?

371
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,486
I'm just not feeling that great,
and it's already kind of late.

372
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,282
No. No, tomorrow
night'll be great.

373
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,491
Okay.

374
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,618
Are you sure you're
not mad at me?

375
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,537
No, not at all.

376
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,788
Okay.

377
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,415
Then good night, sugar.

378
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,791
Good night, popsicle.

379
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,470
Let's see how you're doing
on that report, huh?

380
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,765
- It's good.
- Yeah.

381
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,433
See, Kyle?

382
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,185
What are you doing?

383
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,187
- Cool down.
- Oh.

384
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,355
What time do you
have to be home, Andrew?

385
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,523
It doesn't matter.

386
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,275
Well, you know,
it's just 9:30.

387
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,444
We can go to a video store,
get a movie.

388
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,530
Are you stupid?
I hate watching movies.

389
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,532
You used to like watching
movies when you were a kid.

390
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,534
Yeah, only 'cause
you wanted me to.

391
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,995
Movies are for losers
and art fags.

392
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,790
Oh.
What would you like to do?

393
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,167
Um...

394
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,128
can Andrew and I play "Doom"
on my computer?

395
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,881
Yeah.

396
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,050
Just "Doom," nothing else.

397
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,807
I like your dad.

398
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,183
My dad?

399
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,227
He's a fucking idiot.

400
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,438
Boy:
"Insanity laughs

401
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,025
Under pressure we're cracking

402
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:34,862
can't we give ourselves
one more chance?

403
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,740
Why can't we give love

404
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,909
One more chance?

405
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,746
Why can't we give love

406
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,457
Give love

407
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,794
Give love... "

408
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,420
Stop.

409
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,422
Jason, you didn't
write that.

410
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,592
That's a Queen/Bowie song:
"Under Pressure. "

411
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,427
What were you thinking?

412
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,680
I didn't think
you knew that one.

413
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,598
Jason, I'm white.

414
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,267
- Oh, boy.
- Sit down.

415
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,852
Thank you.

416
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,439
Guys, why are you here
if you're not gonna even try?

417
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,609
Poetry is about saying
something from your heart,

418
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,320
something personal.
Okay?

419
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,613
Yes, Ginger?

420
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,283
I have something
that's kind of personal.

421
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,285
Great. Go ahead.

422
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,171
"It was raining
yesterday afternoon

423
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,966
Water dripping off the lilac bushes
my mother loves

424
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,803
And as I sat and watched the blood
pour out from between my legs

425
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,264
And felt the pain
of motherhood myself

426
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,434
I wondered if it would have
been a boy or a girl. "

427
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,566
Thank you.

428
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,570
That was very personal.

429
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,407
Thanks.

430
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,493
If you ever need to talk
to someone, I'm here.

431
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,079
Why?

432
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,834
Woman singing:
# Yes, it's a good day #

433
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,419
# For singing a song #

434
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,171
# And it's a good day #

435
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,505
# For moving along #

436
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,049
# Yes, it's a good day #

437
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,092
# How could anything
be wrong? #

438
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,720
# A good day
from morning till night #

439
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,181
# And it's a good day #

440
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,682
# For shining your shoes #

441
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,434
# And it's a good day... #

442
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,269
Hello, lamb chop.

443
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,396
Hello, honeydew melon.

444
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,106
What's wrong?

445
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,524
Nothing.

446
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,151
Something's bothering you.

447
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,570
Do you like Mike?

448
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,697
What are you talking about?

449
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,574
Don't get mad. I mean,
I know we've never talked

450
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,868
about not seeing
anyone else.

451
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,537
I'm sorry I said that.

452
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,039
L...

453
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,793
are we still on for dinner?

454
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,672
# I've got a gal
that's always late #

455
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,383
# Every time we have a date #

456
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,927
# But I love her #

457
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,222
# Yes, I love her #

458
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,852
# I'm gonna walk right up
to her gate #

459
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,355
# And see
if I can get it straight #

460
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,733
# 'cause I want her #

461
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,987
# I'm gonna ask her #

462
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:25,324
# I'm gonna say,
"Is you is or is you ain't #

463
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,451
# My baby? #

464
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:33,416
# The way you're acting
lately makes me doubt... " #

465
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,296
- Hello?
- Miss Reed: Hello, jerk.

466
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,298
I am so sorry.

467
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,091
Yeah, you're
a real shitbird.

468
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,592
Don't let it
happen again.

469
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,636
I am such a jerk.

470
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,763
And it will never
happen again.

471
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,685
# Mmm, a woman
is a creature... #

472
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,104
- Hello?
- I'm in here!

473
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,440
# That has always been
strange #

474
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,900
# Just when you're
sure of one #

475
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:04,030
# You find she's gone
and made a change... #

476
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,948
Oh, great. Thanks.

477
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,575
# Is you is or is you ain't... #

478
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,951
That's great.

479
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,536
It's an interesting piece.

480
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,247
- Yeah? You're an interesting piece.
- Oh!

481
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,380
This is just
like high school, right?

482
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,133
Ah. Except I didn't have
any girlfriends in high school.

483
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,135
Oh, well, those girls
were idiots.

484
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,928
I would have
been your girlfriend.

485
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,388
Oh.

486
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,307
If we had a time machine,

487
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,975
let's see...

488
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,310
mmm...

489
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,979
I'd be in high school
and you'd be a fetus.

490
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,898
- I think that's...
- No, that's not cool.

491
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,232
No, not cool.

492
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,361
Ala la la la.

493
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,653
Girl:
Weekend summary:

494
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,822
We did nothing,
followed by nothing,

495
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,991
with a grand finale
of nothing.

496
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,535
About time, Felter.

497
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,913
I think they're doing it.

498
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,456
What?

499
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,958
You... you think
that they're fucking?

500
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,585
Andrew, Andrew, look,

501
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,129
you have to know that fucking pussy
is virgin shit, all right?

502
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,548
When I'm with a bitch,
I just go straight for the brown-eye.

503
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,718
- What?
- I stick my cock in her asshole.

504
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,805
I got that part, but you've never
been with a woman.

505
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,056
Fuck you.

506
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,557
Kyle, I'm always with you.
I know.

507
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,142
No, you're not always with me.

508
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,644
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

509
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,605
Loser.

510
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,649
Oh, you're fucking fucked!

511
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,860
- You're fucking...
- Let it go, Kyle. They're not worth it.

512
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,863
"Aha," yeah. That's right,
laugh it up, you fucking whores.

513
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,538
Don't be shy.

514
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,873
There you go.

515
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,334
Ahh, yeah.

516
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,378
Oh.

517
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,004
Lance:
Hey, buddy, what you doin'?

518
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,549
I'm doing my homework.
What does it look like I'm doing?

519
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,716
Oh.

520
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,095
What?

521
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,639
Nothing. Need a hand?

522
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,350
You know, your report, or...

523
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,687
No. No, it's... no.

524
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,105
Okay.

525
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,941
Hey, listen, I'm going
on a date tonight.

526
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,944
And if you're hungry, I could fix you
some food before I go.

527
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,946
You're going on a date
with who?

528
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,614
Well, no one's
supposed to know

529
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,741
because it could cause
problems at school.

530
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,243
Claire.

531
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,412
Claire?

532
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,122
Do I know this claire?

533
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,166
Miss Reed. Hmm?

534
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,544
Really? You're going out
with the TILF, that's great.

535
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,962
- The what?
- TILF...

536
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,381
- "Teacher I'd like to fuck. "
- Nice mouth.

537
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,717
Hey, it's just what the other
kids at school call her.

538
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,469
What do you think
about Miss Reed?

539
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,680
Well, she's got a hot body,
helmet's okay.

540
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,057
- Do her from behind.
- Hey, come on now!

541
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,268
Kyle, when did you become
such a pervert?

542
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,769
You sound like
your uncle Pete.

543
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,354
There's more
to a woman than that.

544
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,898
What do you think about
her personality?

545
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,151
Oh, um, nah.

546
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,487
She's pretty stuck-up
and she's a phony.

547
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,406
Why do I even
tell you these things?

548
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,083
- Hello?
- Hey.

549
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:06,128
- Hi.
- We still on for some vittles?

550
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,380
Oh, I'm so sorry
I didn't call you sooner.

551
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,424
My mother is having
a nervous breakdown.

552
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,886
Her dog got burnt
by a hair crimper.

553
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,056
They were playing fetch or something...
she's fucking bananas.

554
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,224
Ahh.

555
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,392
I'm so sorry about tonight.

556
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,019
You're not mad, are you?

557
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,312
Mmm, not at all.

558
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,106
Okay, good night, cupcakes.

559
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,275
Good night,
watermelon sherbet.

560
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:39,912
# When I get high #

561
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,333
# This world's so nice #

562
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,128
# When I get high #

563
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,924
# It's paradise... #

564
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,096
Your pot smells like shit.

565
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,974
- Oh. Oh, sorry.
- That's okay.

566
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,476
- Would you like some?
- Are you kidding?

567
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,229
I can barely breathe.

568
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,273
Oh, I'm really sorry.
Oh.

569
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,902
However,

570
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,488
if you were to offer me
some pot brownies,

571
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,990
I wouldn't say no.

572
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,534
- Really?
- Yeah.

573
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:22,037
Tonight when you're
getting changed,

574
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,707
would you mind pulling
your bedroom drapes?

575
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,333
Why?

576
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,460
I think my son watches you.

577
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,004
Get out of here.

578
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,090
No no. I think
he watches you change.

579
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,092
Your son?

580
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,343
Mm-hmm.

581
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,970
I thought he was a zombie.

582
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,763
I wish. I like zombies.

583
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,182
Oh, yeah, you do?
Me too. I do.

584
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,726
- Really?
- Yeah.

585
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,520
Oh, I like the early zombie movies
like "Night of the Living Dead. "

586
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:50,065
- Me too.
- Oh, yeah, don't watch that one alone.

587
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,775
- I don't like the new ones.
- No.

588
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,278
- Zombies are too fast, you know?
- Yeah, too fast. Yeah.

589
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,364
I believe, like Simon Pegg said,
that death is an impediment,

590
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,824
not an energy drink.

591
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,434
What you doing?

592
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,312
Jesus, Dad.
You almost made me crap.

593
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,857
Did you get
your homework done?

594
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,859
Yeah, a long time ago.

595
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,027
Yeah.

596
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,446
- Yeah.
- What...

597
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,448
are you stoned?

598
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,824
No.

599
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,369
Seriously, you smell like pot.
Are you smoking pot?

600
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,204
- No.
- You can tell me.

601
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,623
- No.
- You're not using grass?

602
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,125
No, you don't use grass.
No.

603
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,127
Then what's...
what's that smell?

604
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,712
What smell?

605
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,632
It's probably a skunk outside
or something, you know.

606
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,758
Oh yeah, sure, a skunk.

607
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,760
Hey, you know what?

608
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,012
Why don't we do something
together tomorrow?

609
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,806
Why?
'Cause you feel bad?

610
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,599
Yeah. No.

611
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,228
I mean, it'd be just fun to do
something together, you know?

612
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,396
- Okay.
- Mmm.

613
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,272
Yeah. Yeah,
like build a rocket.

614
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,941
Sure, if you want to.

615
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,943
That's retarded.

616
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,279
Yeah.

617
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,116
- What do you want to do?
- Nothing.

618
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,785
Oh, come on now, Kyle, you must be
passionate about something.

619
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,370
- You want to know what I like?
- Yeah.

620
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,080
- I like looking at vaginas...
- Ahh.

621
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,289
...all day long.

622
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,461
- There you go.
- Yeah.

623
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:38,132
But maybe do something
non-vagina related.

624
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,968
You know, outside the vagina.

625
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,346
Okay, uh,
we could go to the mall.

626
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,640
Okay. And then
we'll catch a movie.

627
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,976
Yeah, sure,
at the mall, you know?

628
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,979
And then we'll maybe
look for a new computer.

629
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,605
No no, we'll just hang.

630
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,150
Dad, did I tell you that
we had to buy a new computer?

631
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,527
No, I said... if you
were listening to me...

632
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,654
that we could look
for a new computer, okay?

633
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,948
And then we'll go
to your movie.

634
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,076
Okay. But we're not buying
a new computer.

635
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,287
Yeah, all right.
Sounds fun.

636
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,997
This isn't
the biggest screen.

637
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,874
Jesus christ,
how about a "thank you"?

638
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,460
Are you on your period
or something?

639
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,128
Can I not say anything?

640
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,633
Hey, isn't that... isn't that
Mike with Miss Reed?

641
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,051
Yeah, it is.

642
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,636
Dude, I wouldn't let
my bitch treat me that way.

643
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,306
- You don't have a "bitch. "
- How do you know?

644
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,183
- Hi, Kyle.
- Hey.

645
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,059
- Mr. Clayton.
- Hello, Andrew.

646
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,771
Oh, wow, so he got it
for you. Sweet.

647
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,565
Not that sweet.
It's not the biggest one.

648
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,943
What... Dad, we're gonna
go home and hook this up.

649
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,320
What about going
to the movies?

650
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,655
Dad, we'll go
to dinner later!

651
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,699
Okay, fine.

652
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,869
Uh, what are you
gonna do, Mr. Clayton?

653
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,413
Oh, probably go to the movies
by myself, Andrew.

654
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,248
Andrew!

655
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,667
What are you doing?

656
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,254
You're carrying that
the rest of the way.

657
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,048
What, are you gonna cry?

658
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,549
Fucking pussy.

659
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,384
God damn it.

660
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,485
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

661
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,071
What did you do today?

662
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,533
I was with Mike. He was having
a breakdown about his divorce.

663
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,952
He was depressed 'cause
he had to go to this wedding,

664
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,539
so I went with him to the mall
and helped him pick up a suit to wear.

665
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,541
I know, I saw you two there.

666
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,043
You did?
Why didn't you say hi?

667
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,463
I don't know.
It seemed weird.

668
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,632
Does it bother you
that I have male friends?

669
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,552
No, it bothers me you keep
our relationship secret

670
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,387
and you're out
in public with him.

671
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,557
Okay. What are you
doing tonight, hmm?

672
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,309
Let's go out.
We'll go out someplace fancy,

673
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,228
someplace the world
can see us.

674
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,314
How about
Outback Steakhouse?

675
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,608
Oh.

676
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,569
Anyone who's anybody
will be there.

677
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,487
You know, we can have
Aussie-Tizers...

678
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,866
You know, wait, I can't.
I promised Kyle I'd take him out.

679
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,367
Let me take
both of you out.

680
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,369
- It'll be my treat.
- Really?

681
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:16,164
Oh. That's so nice.

682
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,462
- Hey, Kyle.
- I'm in here.

683
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,091
Why do you always
tip over this photo?

684
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,760
'Cause I hate it.
I look inbred.

685
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,053
I think you look handsome.

686
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,139
We're going out to dinner
tonight with claire.

687
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,974
What? No.

688
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,434
- No, we're not.
- Oh, come on.

689
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,185
- I thought she was seeing Mr. Lane.
- No no.

690
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,063
They're just friends and she's trying
to help him out through a tough time.

691
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,648
Why am I explaining
this to you, Kyle?

692
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,233
Dad, okay, look,

693
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,777
it's bad enough being
seen with a teacher as a dad,

694
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,988
but being seen
with two teachers is AIDS.

695
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,573
Okay, get dressed.
Put on something nice.

696
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,326
If you don't act right at dinner,
I'll stab you in the face.

697
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,831
So what do you like
to do, Kyle?

698
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,292
Nothing.

699
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,378
Nothing? You must like
to do something.

700
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,756
No.

701
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,717
Kyle just got a new monitor
for his computer.

702
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,303
So what do you like
to do on the computer?

703
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,014
Oh, well, you know,
it's funny you ask.

704
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,058
- I like...
- Games, mostly.

705
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,562
- Kyle, who are you texting?
- Andrew.

706
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,731
Why don't you give it a break
while we're eating, son?

707
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,107
No, I can't do that.
It's important.

708
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,109
Put it away.

709
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,243
So, Kyle,

710
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,496
do you have a girlfriend?

711
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:41,291
I'm not gonna talk to you
about my personal affairs.

712
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,670
- Okay.
- Ooh.

713
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:45,921
Watch out.

714
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,131
Are you guys doing it?

715
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,137
Yeah, all the time.
Non-stop.

716
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,181
I'm hurting right now.

717
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,311
Let's not make me
throw up.

718
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,441
So do you play sports?

719
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:09,319
No no.
I'm a big spaz like my dad.

720
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,406
Well, I was on the dive team
in college.

721
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,992
Diving is not really
a sport, it's falling.

722
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,413
I'm sorry.

723
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,791
No offense.
It's just funny.

724
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,252
Hey, why don't we rent
a movie after dinner?

725
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,046
Sure, as long as
it's not horror.

726
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,215
- Really?
- I do not like horror.

727
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,467
Zombies? Are you
okay with zombies?

728
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,344
- No.
- Oh.

729
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,848
Do you like musicals?
I love musicals.

730
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,059
Bob Fosse
was a great director.

731
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:42,936
He did "Sweet charity"

732
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,730
- and "All That Jazz. "
- "Cabaret. "

733
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:47,441
One of the great
Nazi musicals of all time,

734
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,317
besides "The Sound
of Music," you know?

735
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,945
Then he did "Star 80."
That was not a musical, but...

736
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,989
- I only like the musicals.
- Oh, well.

737
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,825
- Me too.
- "Willy Wonka. "

738
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,953
- Which one?
- Lance: Well, Gene Wilder.

739
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,205
I like Johnny Depp.

740
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,290
- Oh.
- Yeah.

741
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,374
- Mm-hmm.
- But you know what?

742
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,334
I like Gene Wilder...

743
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:11,006
...in "Young...
- Both: Frankenstein. "

744
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,842
"What hump?"

745
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,927
Did you see it?

746
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,055
- No.
- Oh, you should.

747
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,474
- It's amazing.
- Really wonderful.

748
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,017
Yeah.
Everybody's seen it.

749
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,478
- I'm sure.
- Yeah.

750
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,230
- Night, Miss Reed.
- Good night, Kyle.

751
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,816
Do you think you're gonna
hit that shit tonight?

752
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,234
- Shut up!
- Come on, dude.

753
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,529
That shit's tight, dude.
Seriously, if you don't nail her...

754
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,364
hey hey, if you don't nail her,
dude, you're...

755
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,075
- you're an asshole.
- Will you stop it?

756
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,077
Don't act like you don't think
about pussy all the time too.

757
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,620
- I know you do.
- Kyle.

758
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,830
You're dropping me off first,
I get it. You want me to go.

759
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,124
I just wanna say good night
to her alone.

760
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,918
- Okay?
- With your cock.

761
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,669
Kyle, you ruin everything.

762
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,588
Would you
just shut the fuck up?

763
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,883
Jesus, man. You fucking
need to get laid. Go over there.

764
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,676
I'll be right back.

765
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,887
All right. Don't do anything
I wouldn't do, okay?

766
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,599
Short of killing her,
that leaves me a lot of room.

767
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,810
Hey, baby.

768
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,561
See you tomorrow, Kyle.

769
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,814
Night, whore.

770
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,904
Hey.

771
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,823
- That was fun.
- The kiss?

772
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,449
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll show you something, come on.

773
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,243
- Not tonight.
- Wow.

774
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,869
Are you shooting
me down?

775
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,288
Listen, I'd love to stay,
but I promised Kyle I'd be right back.

776
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,624
Kyle doesn't like me.

777
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,501
Oh no.
He likes you a lot.

778
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,002
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

779
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,254
He told me that
when I dropped him off.

780
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,005
- He did?
- Yeah.

781
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,757
He said I was a lucky guy.

782
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,760
No, I'm the lucky guy.

783
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,346
I gotta go.

784
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,598
Oh, come on.
He's almost an adult.

785
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,600
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

786
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,770
Whoa.

787
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,022
How are you gonna drive
home with that boner, huh?

788
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,650
I don't know. There's a stick-shift
joke there somewhere

789
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,361
but I can't find it 'cause
all the blood's leaving my brain.

790
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:02,200
- Sleep well.
- Hey.

791
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,955
Oh, that's sweet.
Mmm.

792
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,292
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Oh. Boo.

793
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,794
- You're mean.
- Good night, sweet pea.

794
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,379
Good night,
cream cheese.

795
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,927
You know I... oh!

796
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,345
- Hmm?
- Damn you.

797
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,597
You sure?

798
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,355
I'm back.

799
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,110
Kyle.

800
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,988
Hey, Kyle.

801
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,450
Oh, Kyle.
I told you to stop doing that.

802
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,925
Kyle?

803
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:21,029
# Don't be afraid #

804
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:25,575
# It's only love #

805
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,746
# Don't be afraid #

806
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:34,501
# It's only love #

807
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,713
# Don't be afraid #

808
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,051
# It's only love #

809
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,222
# Don't be afraid #

810
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,059
# It's only love #

811
00:37:52,561 --> 00:38:28,430
# Love is simple #

812
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,962
# Don't be afraid #

813
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:06,176
# You're already dead #

814
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,971
# Don't be afraid #

815
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:14,768
# You're already dead #

816
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:18,396
# Don't be afraid #

817
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:23,360
# You're already dead #

818
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:27,155
# Don't be afraid #

819
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:31,826
# You're already dead #

820
00:39:32,828 --> 00:40:21,084
# Love is simple #

821
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:59,038
# La la la la la #

822
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:06,421
# La la la la la. #

823
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,531
Welcome back, Lance.

824
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,533
Hi.

825
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:38,077
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

826
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,747
If you need more time off,
take it.

827
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,124
Nobody here would
fault you for that.

828
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,376
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.

829
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,059
Ginger.

830
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,645
Hey, Mike.

831
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,147
It's good to have
you back, Lancelot.

832
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,857
Thanks.

833
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,208
Mr. Clayton.

834
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,293
Andrew.

835
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,921
How are you doing?

836
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,549
Okay.
I'm really sorry.

837
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,592
Thanks.

838
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,594
And I'm sorry
about my mom.

839
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,180
- Why?
- 'Cause she threw up in your planter

840
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,391
at that thing at your house
after the funeral.

841
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,892
I wondered who did that.

842
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,686
She drinks too much.

843
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,396
I know.

844
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,064
Don't worry, Andrew.

845
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,149
It meant a lot to me
that you came.

846
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,151
Thanks, Mr. Clayton.
Mr. Clayton.

847
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,655
Something doesn't make
sense to me.

848
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,156
What, Andrew?

849
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:00,034
Did Kyle seem
that bummed out to you?

850
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,995
What do you mean?

851
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,705
To do what he did.
He just...

852
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:07,250
it's just, he didn't
seem that sad.

853
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,879
Andrew, Kyle was
a complex guy.

854
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:15,216
Yeah, I'll say.

855
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,782
- Hey.
- Hey.

856
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,621
How are you?

857
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,581
I'm okay.

858
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,583
Good.

859
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,588
I want to apologize that I haven't
been there more for you.

860
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:57,467
It's just that
I don't do death well.

861
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,469
Don't worry about it,
you know, I...

862
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,597
I've been kind of a zombie
lately anyway.

863
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,515
I'm really sorry.

864
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,142
Please don't be mad.

865
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,102
I'm not.

866
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:11,230
Let's do something soon,
all right?

867
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,358
All right.

868
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,613
Cheer up, pumpkin.

869
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,365
I like you.

870
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,575
Thanks.

871
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,254
Anderson:
Hardly anyone came to the funeral.

872
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,964
I felt bad.
I should have gone.

873
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,676
Don't blame yourself.
It was a weekday.

874
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,806
Lance,

875
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,808
this is Mr. Pentola.

876
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,101
- Mr. Pentola.
- Dr. Pentola.

877
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,644
Oh, Doctor.

878
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,647
Nice to meet you, Mr. Clayton.
I'm very sorry for your loss.

879
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,773
Thank you.

880
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,067
Dr. Pentola is a therapist.

881
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,653
We called him in
because we were afraid

882
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,281
Kyle's death may
trigger other suicides.

883
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,117
He's a grief counselor.

884
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,493
Oh.

885
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,911
Before we begin,

886
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,663
I've read a lot of suicide notes,

887
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,083
and this one seemed...

888
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,960
deep.

889
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,545
Really?

890
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,463
I need to ask you
a question.

891
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:20,049
And I want you to be
completely honest with me.

892
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,135
Of course.

893
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,429
Did Kyle have any friends?

894
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,972
Excuse me?

895
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,932
Well, it's just
no one's come to see me.

896
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,559
You'd have to know Kyle.

897
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,561
Well, I shouldn't say
no one.

898
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,230
A couple of kids came in
with age-appropriate depression,

899
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,606
eating disorders.

900
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,400
One kid came in
with head lice.

901
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,693
I know him.

902
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,695
Not really my area
of expertise.

903
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:43,573
But no one's come to talk
about Kyle.

904
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,575
Hmm.

905
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,287
- Oh.
- Who were his friends?

906
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,374
- Andrew Troutman.
- And who else?

907
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,878
That's it.

908
00:45:57,045 --> 00:46:00,715
Kyle was kind
of a loner.

909
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,633
A lone wolf.

910
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:06,179
Uh, I'll have to ask Andrew

911
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,014
to come and see me.

912
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,433
And, Lance,
that goes for you too.

913
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,352
If you need to talk, if you wanna
get anything off your chest,

914
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,104
please, just come
and see me.

915
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,773
Of course, Doc, I will.

916
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,692
Thank you, Lance.

917
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,402
You're welcome,
Mr. Anderson.

918
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,741
All right, guys,
who wants to read next?

919
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,534
- Right here!
- All right.

920
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,244
Who's gonna
give me $20?

921
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,205
- All: Oh.
- Oh, come on now.

922
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,249
Mike: All right. Okay.

923
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,586
Jason.

924
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,178
Go ahead.

925
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,559
"Negro?

926
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,686
I may be young
but I'm not your boy

927
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:58,439
I won't pick your cotton
or pick up your dishes

928
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,609
Yeah, I sing, I dance

929
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,737
But I do it with the dignity
of my ancestors

930
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,365
I am not your monkey. "

931
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,077
Right on.

932
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,873
Stay black, y'all.

933
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,503
Anybody else
have their haiku?

934
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,978
- Claire: Hello?
- Hey, sweet tarts.

935
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,230
- Hey.
- How are you?

936
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,400
- What are you doing?
- I'm watching Mike play basketball.

937
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,860
Oh.

938
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,031
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

939
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,991
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

940
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,701
- Oh my God!
- What?

941
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,495
I gotta go. Mike just won
the basketball game.

942
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,790
Yeah, Mike!

943
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,596
- Hi.
- Hi.

944
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,932
I made you something.

945
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:56,974
What?

946
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,144
- Those brownies.
- Oh.

947
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,021
- Oh.
- Yeah.

948
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,023
Well, I'll come over
and have some.

949
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,275
I was thinking maybe I could come in
and we'd eat them together.

950
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,652
No, I can't.

951
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,445
- Why not?
- I'm busy.

952
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,155
Bonnie, I really need
to talk to somebody.

953
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,699
I don't like people
in my apartment.

954
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,869
My apartment is a little
sad right now, you know?

955
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:22,583
If I... if I let you in,
you can't tell anybody.

956
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,710
- Okay.
- Okay.

957
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,922
So...

958
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,091
- Brownies, huh?
- Yeah.

959
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,593
- Come in.
- Ah.

960
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:41,352
Please, don't tell
anybody, okay?

961
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,771
Because I... I don't wanna get
thrown out of here.

962
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,148
- Oh, I promise.
- Thanks.

963
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,651
I- I know
it's a fire hazard

964
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,779
and I know it's not
rational, but...

965
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:55,992
I feel that
if I throw anything out,

966
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,202
something terrible
will happen.

967
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,162
- No, I understand that.
- Good.

968
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,174
What's wrong, sweetie?

969
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,763
I know my son was a jerk,
but I miss him.

970
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,974
Hey.

971
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,059
- Of course you do.
- Mmm.

972
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,811
It'll get better.

973
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:27,398
It doesn't feel like it
right now.

974
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,108
Do you know that

975
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,319
I have read every one
of your books?

976
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,364
- How?
- How?

977
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,074
You threw 'em out.

978
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,826
Oh, yeah.

979
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,746
You are very talented.

980
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,039
Really?

981
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,541
Honest.
You have a gift.

982
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,544
And you can't give up.

983
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,046
I won't.

984
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,464
Listen,

985
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:54,800
they're gonna have a zombie
marathon on television

986
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,928
and I cordially

987
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,513
invite you, sir.

988
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,348
Oh, well, bless you, madam.

989
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,142
- Uh-huh.
- It's a date.

990
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,351
Good.

991
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,479
Don't forget the brownies.

992
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,731
- I won't forget.
- No.

993
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,278
Your dog's staring at me.

994
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,906
What dog?

995
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:22,369
I got ya.

996
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,248
- Lance!
- Oh.

997
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,459
- I'm glad I caught you.
- What's up?

998
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:32,338
You know that while we respect
individual privacy,

999
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,549
we also respect freedom of speech
and expression here at school?

1000
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:38,052
- Yeah.
- Well, one of the kids on the paper

1001
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,846
went online and they found
Kyle's police report...

1002
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:44,558
the report of his death. And now they've
gone and published his suicide note.

1003
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,353
- Oh my God.
- Yeah. I just found out about it.

1004
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,814
I thought you should know.
It's all over campus.

1005
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,233
- Really?
- Yeah.

1006
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,527
You... are you
gonna be all right?

1007
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,570
Sure.

1008
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,823
I'm really sorry
about this, Lance.

1009
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,075
It's that goddamn
first amendment, huh?

1010
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,743
Yeah.

1011
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,209
Lance's voice:
"To all those I hate,

1012
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,003
I don't know why
I'm writing this.

1013
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:16,715
You never cared about what I thought
or felt while I was alive.

1014
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:20,553
Besides you're all too shallow
to comprehend the pain I feel. "

1015
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,597
# I hope
I become a ghost #

1016
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,934
# I hope I can see
the end of time #

1017
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,979
# I hope I become
a ghost #

1018
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,149
# And make sure
the future turns out fine #

1019
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,360
# I hope
I become a ghost #

1020
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,697
# Oh, when the world
is said and done #

1021
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,992
# The stars will become
so close #

1022
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,287
# And there will be nowhere
that I can't run #

1023
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:50,249
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh #

1024
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,317
# I hope
I become a ghost #

1025
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:19,320
# And watch all my
grandchildren growing old #

1026
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,156
# Some they will
remember me #

1027
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,367
# And others through the stories
they've been told #

1028
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,704
# Now I don't intend
to frighten you #

1029
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,957
# I just wanna see
if what I think is true #

1030
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,877
# 'cause then and only then
we'll know #

1031
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,297
# If it was worth
to become a ghost #

1032
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:42,843
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh #

1033
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:55,648
# There's nothing
sad about it #

1034
00:53:55,815 --> 00:54:01,278
# There's
nothing sad about it... #

1035
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,035
Lance's voice:
"Which brings me to you, Dad.

1036
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,120
Lance and Kyle's voices:
Don't blame yourself.

1037
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:13,958
You tried hard and were
the best dad a kid could want.

1038
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,336
I blame me doing this
on a defect in me...

1039
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,506
Kyle's voice:
... in my soul.

1040
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,675
I'm sorry. "

1041
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,811
# Now that I've become
a ghost #

1042
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:40,359
# I don't get to laugh
with friends like you #

1043
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:45,281
# There's nothing sad
about it #

1044
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:50,661
# There's nothing
sad about it. #

1045
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,415
I love you, Dad.

1046
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:05,342
Has anyone seen
carl or Steven?

1047
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,593
Mm-hmm.

1048
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,138
Oh, you have?
So they're in school?

1049
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,598
Yeah, I saw 'em
this morning.

1050
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,603
First of all I want to thank you all
for being here,

1051
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,439
especially the newcomers.

1052
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,899
It means a lot to me.

1053
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,402
Who has experience
with writing poetry?

1054
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,071
- Yes, Heather.
- Can I ask a question?

1055
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,406
Sure.

1056
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,409
What was Kyle's
favorite band?

1057
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,577
Uh...

1058
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,912
he liked
Bruce Hornsby.

1059
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,081
Yes, Ray?

1060
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,875
Did he listen
to any metal?

1061
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,502
- A little Ozzy.
- I knew it.

1062
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,881
Anybody have any questions
about poetry or...

1063
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:44,923
Yes, Jason?

1064
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,759
Did the boy know Jesus
before he went?

1065
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,553
Well, I would say
he was an agnostic.

1066
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,056
But I think he was spiritual
in his own way.

1067
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,640
Yeah... yes, Heather?

1068
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:54,892
What's his sign?

1069
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,686
Oh, he was born
April 18th, so...

1070
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,730
Aries.

1071
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,399
I can't believe
you didn't know that.

1072
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,444
You know, anybody know
Ezra Pound?

1073
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,946
Lawrence Ferlinghetti?

1074
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:13,243
You know
what Kyle really liked?

1075
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,787
Emily Dickinson.

1076
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,538
What band is that?

1077
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,624
It wasn't a band.
She was a poet.

1078
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:21,877
- She hot?
- Um, she was a Victorian.

1079
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,963
If you like your buttoned-down
girl, she was one of 'em.

1080
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,424
Nice.

1081
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:28,884
- Mr. Clayton.
- Peter.

1082
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,262
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

1083
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,889
It's about Kyle's note.

1084
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,891
It... it affected me a lot.

1085
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,937
Well, it seemed to affect
a lot of students.

1086
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,189
- I'm not happy, Mr. Clayton.
- Mm-hmm.

1087
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,234
I'm living a lie. I'm gay.

1088
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,236
And Kyle's suicide note,

1089
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,280
it's helped me get
the courage to come out finally.

1090
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,491
Well, are you sure
you want to do that?

1091
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,660
I'm misunderstood too,
just like he was.

1092
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,745
I just want to be happy.

1093
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,706
Good for you, Peter.
I- I wish you the best.

1094
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,667
Thank you.

1095
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,674
Hey, Mr. Clayton.

1096
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,175
- Mr. Clayton.
- Ginger.

1097
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,302
Kyle was right.
Emily Dickinson's great.

1098
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,179
Isn't she?

1099
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,848
- Mr. Clayton?
- Yes.

1100
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:19,268
- I wrote another poem.
- Can't wait to hear it, Heather.

1101
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,354
- John. Doctor.
- Hey.

1102
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,064
Claire.

1103
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:27,025
Mr. C., what's up?

1104
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:33,282
"Milky white skin
and hair so brown

1105
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,201
I wish I had known
how bad you hurt

1106
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,871
I could have held you
while you cried

1107
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,039
You were too sweet
to stay

1108
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,833
In this harsh world

1109
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:46,211
But I will always
keep you close to my heart

1110
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,965
- My angel in cargo pants. "
- Boy: Oh, wow.

1111
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:09,026
He was such a sweet kid.

1112
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,403
And kind.

1113
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,908
Oh, please.
They're everywhere.

1114
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,910
As a father,

1115
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:21,079
I don't know what I'd do
if Hunter did something like this.

1116
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,207
My heart really goes
out to you, Lance.

1117
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,875
Thanks.

1118
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,419
It's so sad. I didn't know
he was such a good writer.

1119
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,422
Did he write anything else?

1120
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,885
Yeah, he did.

1121
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:38,305
I know it's really personal,
but do you think I could read it?

1122
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,141
Well, if you came over
to my apartment.

1123
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:44,061
I just don't want his stuff
out there, you know, floating around.

1124
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,396
Sure.
How about tonight?

1125
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,898
Great.

1126
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,571
My playoff game's tonight.

1127
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,243
All right.
Not the lip.

1128
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,827
You know I can't
take the lip.

1129
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,746
Oh, thanks, Mike.

1130
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,958
What time?

1131
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,461
I'm gonna need a little time because,
you know, I haven't cleaned.

1132
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,255
Yeah, I understand.

1133
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:15,592
- Well, 8:00?
- That's great.

1134
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,518
Good luck tonight.

1135
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,104
Thanks.

1136
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,148
If you think this is
a bad idea...

1137
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,359
No no no.
Not at all.

1138
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,861
I found something
Kyle wrote

1139
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:38,365
and I really think
you need to hear it.

1140
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,534
Okay.

1141
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:57,050
This is from his journal.

1142
00:59:57,218 --> 01:00:01,179
"I went out to dinner
with my dad and claire tonight.

1143
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,433
I'm so happy for him,

1144
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,227
but at the same time
seeing them together

1145
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,063
only proves that I'll
never be happy.

1146
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:13,900
I know I'll never find
a woman like her...

1147
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:17,571
so pretty, so perfect.

1148
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,283
She seems to complete him.

1149
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,414
I hope they make it.

1150
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,666
I hope they last.

1151
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:32,919
I hope I'm leaving
my dad in good hands.

1152
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,299
No one could ever get me.

1153
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,429
I don't even get me. "

1154
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,599
Oh.

1155
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,935
I didn't know anyone
could feel that way about me.

1156
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:51,271
He did like me.
He really did.

1157
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,939
He did.
He really did.

1158
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,233
I thought you were lying
to make me feel better.

1159
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,861
No. I'd never do that.

1160
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,321
- Really?
- Really.

1161
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,390
Mr. Clayton.

1162
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,600
- Good morning, Heather.
- Yes.

1163
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,310
Good morning.

1164
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,397
Do you have anything
of Kyle's?

1165
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,606
What?

1166
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,192
That I could have?

1167
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,361
- No.
- Oh.

1168
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,280
Wait a second.

1169
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,911
Here you go.

1170
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,413
Bruce Hornsby?

1171
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,999
That was his favorite.

1172
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,960
Thank you.

1173
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,522
I need to talk
about last night.

1174
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:17,691
Yeah, I need to talk
about last night too.

1175
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,318
Yeah.

1176
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:23,488
I'm tired of hiding
our relationship.

1177
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:33,039
Mmm.

1178
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:56,396
- Dan.
- Lance.

1179
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,483
- Ginger.
- Mr. Clayton, look at this.

1180
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,443
Oh.

1181
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,990
Heather.

1182
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,909
Hey, Mr. C.

1183
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:11,661
Oh, Peter.

1184
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,914
- Don't leave me hanging.
- Oh.

1185
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:16,124
I don't know
if Kyle ever told you,

1186
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,793
but he and I were
kinda bros.

1187
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,795
I'm gonna win this game
tonight in his honor.

1188
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,880
Great, Peter.

1189
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,562
Andrew:
Mr. Clayton?

1190
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:38,772
Andrew.

1191
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,191
It doesn't seem right,
does it?

1192
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,026
What doesn't seem right?

1193
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,861
How everyone is acting.

1194
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,780
Like they liked Kyle.

1195
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,865
No, it doesn't.

1196
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:51,034
You know what else
is weird?

1197
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:54,538
- What?
- Kyle's suicide note.

1198
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,414
In what way?

1199
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:58,917
That stuff about being
an insignificant molecule

1200
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,711
bouncing around in a meaningless
godless universe.

1201
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:05,340
Don't take this the wrong way,
but Kyle was...

1202
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,384
What?

1203
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,386
Kinda dumb.

1204
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,596
Ha. No.

1205
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,641
Kyle was actually smart, Andrew.

1206
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:17,853
You know, he just pretended
to be dumb, even around you

1207
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,730
so, you know, people
wouldn't pick on him.

1208
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,816
Yeah, maybe.

1209
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,735
- Heather: It's mine!
- Ginger: Let go, you crazy...

1210
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,237
Hey!

1211
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,780
Oh! Get off!

1212
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,323
You didn't even like Kyle!

1213
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,867
You didn't like Kyle!

1214
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,035
Shut up, whore!

1215
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:46,381
Bruce Hornsby?

1216
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,592
Lance:
I need to talk to someone.

1217
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,302
That's why I'm here.

1218
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,971
I feel terrible.

1219
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,931
Suicide leaves
many victims.

1220
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,100
Don't beat yourself up.

1221
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,477
Kyle may have been suffering
from a chemical imbalance.

1222
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:02,188
And I know that the note
being published

1223
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,274
has caused you some
distress,

1224
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,861
but in many ways
it's been a very positive thing.

1225
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,946
Students are
coming to see me.

1226
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,823
It's the breakthrough
I've been waiting for.

1227
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,159
Who knows how many
of these kids

1228
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:17,495
I can help because they're
reaching out for the first time?

1229
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,790
You have to remember
the part where Kyle writes:

1230
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,084
"I love you, Dad. "

1231
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,588
But what if he didn't
really feel that way?

1232
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,715
But he did.

1233
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:32,135
Lance, suicide

1234
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,679
is a permanent solution

1235
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,973
to temporary problems.

1236
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:39,017
And who knows

1237
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:42,020
how many kids we won't lose
because of that note?

1238
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,814
Keep your chin up knowing

1239
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:48,318
that Kyle may have not
died in vain.

1240
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:53,907
# In light of all
I've learned so far #

1241
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,660
# I don't believe
I'm so strange #

1242
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:59,788
# In spite of all
this time I spend #

1243
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,374
# calling the air
by a name #

1244
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:05,418
# When the first light
goes over the trees #

1245
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:07,963
# He will be
singing with me #

1246
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,132
# And if I feel like
singing alone #

1247
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,885
# He always
leaves me be #

1248
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,680
# I'm shaking
my shadow hand #

1249
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:19,516
# As the sun moves
round the bend #

1250
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,435
# With an imaginary man #

1251
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:28,316
# And we'll make-believe
around and around again #

1252
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,611
# I'm shaking
my shadow hand... #

1253
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,077
Lance:
Dr. Pentola.

1254
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,829
Lance, you don't look
so good.

1255
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,747
Well, I had kind
of a rough weekend.

1256
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,457
I did a lot of soul
searching

1257
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,960
and I thought about what you said
about Kyle's note

1258
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:48,712
and the effect
on the other kids,

1259
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,047
and...

1260
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:53,049
this is Kyle's journal.

1261
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:55,051
I brought it to you to read.

1262
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:58,138
I want you to read it, and if you think
it'll be of value to the other kids,

1263
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:00,724
I wanna publish it
and hand it out to them.

1264
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,812
- I'll see if I can't give it a look.
- Oh, thanks.

1265
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:11,234
Lance:
Well?

1266
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,406
It's so sad.

1267
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:17,782
Yeah.

1268
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:20,035
I mean, Kyle was such

1269
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,829
a strong powerful writer.

1270
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,707
So tortured.

1271
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,625
Yes, he was.

1272
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:32,547
What are you
gonna call it?

1273
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,800
I was thinking
"I Am What I Hate. "

1274
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:37,218
What?

1275
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:41,598
"I Am What I Hate. "
Kyle wrote that in chapter six.

1276
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,141
Oh.

1277
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,518
- Really?
- Yeah.

1278
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,520
I don't like it at all.

1279
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:49,064
Why?

1280
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:53,860
- To me, a better title...
- Mm-hmm.

1281
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:57,072
...would be
"You Don't Know Me. "

1282
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,448
- Oh.
- You know?

1283
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:01,659
Because
we didn't know him.

1284
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,955
But he didn't write
that though, I mean...

1285
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:08,083
Yeah, but he felt that.

1286
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:10,418
- You're inferring that from him.
- Yes.

1287
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,462
Oh.

1288
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,632
"I Am What I Hate" doesn't
make sense as a title.

1289
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:21,429
Give me a kiss. Aw.

1290
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,227
- Come here.
- Oh.

1291
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:32,607
# Everybody wants
to be a genius #

1292
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:37,904
# You're not the only one #

1293
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,865
# With all the things that
you might do #

1294
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,993
# Which one of them
will you get to? #

1295
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:46,913
# Tomorrow when
you wake up #

1296
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,791
# Then you'll show them #

1297
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,799
# Nobody wants
to break your heart #

1298
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:03,054
# You do it on your own #

1299
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,765
# There's nothing wrong
with you today #

1300
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:09,477
# Nothing you had
that they took away #

1301
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:12,605
# But all the time
you've waited for #

1302
01:09:12,773 --> 01:09:14,816
# What is owed to you #

1303
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:18,153
# You wanna fight,
they will fight you blue #

1304
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,990
# You wanna lie,
who will lie with you? #

1305
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:25,326
# You're the only one
waiting for a sign #

1306
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:31,082
# So you're the only one #

1307
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,376
# So you're
the only one #

1308
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:47,515
# Everyone's had
some situation #

1309
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:51,561
# Keep it to yourself #

1310
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:54,230
# There's no need
to answer questions #

1311
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:58,151
# Your lies have spoiled
two confessions #

1312
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,486
# And all the time
you've waited #

1313
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:03,364
# Won't come back to you #

1314
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:07,243
# You wanna fight,
they will fight you blue #

1315
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:10,622
# You wanna lie,
who will lie with you? #

1316
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:14,083
# You're the only one
waiting for a sign... #

1317
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:19,214
# So you're the only one #

1318
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,466
# So you're
the only one #

1319
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:25,220
# Everybody wants to be
a genius. #

1320
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:29,349
Everybody loves the book.

1321
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:31,267
Yes, they do.

1322
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:33,978
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1323
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:35,480
Fuck me.

1324
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,191
- I am.
- Harder.

1325
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,445
No no no.
From behind.

1326
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,614
Okay. Okay.

1327
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,077
- Like that?
- Yeah.

1328
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,495
- Okay.
- To the left.

1329
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,248
To the left.
My left. My left.

1330
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,375
Okay.
Yeah!

1331
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:56,876
Yeah.
Don't stop.

1332
01:10:57,044 --> 01:11:00,630
Don't stop.
Don't stop!

1333
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,257
- Stop! Stop. Stop.
- Okay. Sorry.

1334
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:03,925
- Pull my hair.
- Like that?

1335
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,677
- Not... not so hard.
- Oh, okay.

1336
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:08,263
Are you ready
for our undead marathon?

1337
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,515
Lance: Well, that's the thing.
Something came up.

1338
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,600
Kind of an emergency.
I can't make it.

1339
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:15,645
- Sorry.
- Oh. No, it's okay.

1340
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,939
- Can I take a rain check?
- Oh yeah, dear. Good.

1341
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,066
Yeah, listen I...
I hope everything's okay.

1342
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,859
Oh, yeah.
It's just a small emergency.

1343
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:25,822
- Okay. See you.
- Sorry. Bye.

1344
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,032
Mike:
Everything okay there, pal?

1345
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,242
Yeah, great.

1346
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,703
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1347
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:33,746
You know what line
really blew me away,

1348
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:35,498
is when Kyle wrote:

1349
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:38,960
"America is one of the finest
countries anyone ever stole. "

1350
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,129
That was brilliant.

1351
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,756
He reminds me
of my Hunter.

1352
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,968
Lance, I have
a confession to make.

1353
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,637
I lured you out here
under false pretenses.

1354
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:51,973
I need to ask you
something.

1355
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,184
Would it be all right with you
if we renamed the library

1356
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:57,937
the Kyle clayton
memorial library?

1357
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:00,523
But you were gonna put him
in a special-needs class.

1358
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,151
Yeah.

1359
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,403
Yeah, and I feel
really bad about that.

1360
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,655
- Oh.
- He wasn't slow.

1361
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,657
Obviously
he was brilliant.

1362
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,160
He was just bored.

1363
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,287
You know, we had him
totally wrong.

1364
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:18,124
I just hope to God that our mistake
didn't have anything to do with...

1365
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,209
well, with what happened.

1366
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:21,669
I'm pretty sure it didn't.

1367
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,004
Thanks, Lance.

1368
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,089
Your saying that
means a lot.

1369
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:28,176
This tribute will be
an inspiration to other students

1370
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,261
and it'll help keep
Kyle's memory alive.

1371
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:33,806
Sure, sir. Wyatt.

1372
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:36,559
Thanks, Lance.
Thanks.

1373
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,732
Oh!

1374
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:46,361
Just like my prom night,
nothing went in the hole.

1375
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,656
No, it's good. It's gonna be
a tasteful dedication.

1376
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:52,367
Very tasteful.

1377
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,164
Hello?

1378
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:03,544
You're kidding me.

1379
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,463
Thank you so much.

1380
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,257
- Wow.
- What?

1381
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:11,386
Pentola... he sent
Kyle's journal to Dr. Dana.

1382
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,179
She loves it. She wants me
to be on the show.

1383
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,680
She's gonna fly me to L.A.

1384
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:17,725
- What's Dr. Dana?
- She's like Oprah.

1385
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:21,145
Well, she's not
as big as Oprah.

1386
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,941
I mean, it's a good show,
you know?

1387
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,068
Women seem to really like it.

1388
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:40,331
- Andrew.
- Are you busy, Mr. Clayton?

1389
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,750
Oh, no no.
Just packing for my trip.

1390
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:45,044
Yeah, that TV show.

1391
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:47,505
"Dr. Dana. "

1392
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:50,383
What's up?

1393
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:51,801
I feel bad.

1394
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:54,595
I wish I knew
he was that depressed.

1395
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,472
You and me both.

1396
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,808
You know what's strange
about the book?

1397
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,017
What?

1398
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:03,438
Kyle never talks
about vaginas, anal sex,

1399
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,857
fisting, felching
or rim jobs.

1400
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:09,235
It is a little light on the felching
area, you're right.

1401
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:12,905
But I think it's there,
Andrew, in its own way.

1402
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:16,742
I was his best friend.
The book is so smart and sad.

1403
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:18,870
He never talked
with me like that.

1404
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:22,081
I wish he did. Maybe he wouldn't
have done what he did.

1405
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,250
Don't blame yourself,
Andrew.

1406
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,544
One thing I know,
he liked you.

1407
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,171
Then why didn't he
talk to me?

1408
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:29,755
What do you want me
to tell you, Andrew?

1409
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:31,340
Maybe it's like
I told you before,

1410
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:33,342
he was super smart.
He didn't want people to know

1411
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:35,136
because he was afraid
of being treated differently.

1412
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,763
But it doesn't make sense.
He was already treated like a freak.

1413
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,308
If he was that smart he would have
loved to rub their noses in it.

1414
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,935
Oh, Jesus christ, Andrew.
Why can't you let it go, okay?

1415
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:45,521
No wonder
your mother drinks.

1416
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:48,483
You know one of the last
things Kyle said to me?

1417
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:51,486
He said that you're
a stupid fucking idiot.

1418
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,529
Have a good time
on your TV show.

1419
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:55,364
Kyle's still dead.

1420
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:57,158
Andrew.

1421
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:02,121
Are you almost ready?
I think we should get going.

1422
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,165
Claire: I think you should
keep your pants on.

1423
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,000
I think you should put
your pants on.

1424
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,710
I'm not going
to wear pants.

1425
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:10,254
Oh. I'm really nervous.

1426
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,631
Yeah, you should be.

1427
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:13,299
Mmm. Thanks.

1428
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:15,426
I'm using backward
psychology.

1429
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:18,179
It's not working.
I have to pee again.

1430
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,853
- Hello.
- Mr. Clayton,

1431
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:28,731
I don't wanna be rude
but the show called again

1432
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:31,776
- and we really should be leaving.
- Okay, thank you very much.

1433
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,488
Baby, that was the driver.
He said the show called.

1434
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,740
We gotta get going, okay?

1435
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:39,784
Oh, you look gorgeous.
Let's get going, come on.

1436
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,328
- Does this make my ass look big?
- No no. Not at all.

1437
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:44,539
- You can't see your ass.
- What do you mean?

1438
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:47,375
- I mean...
- So you're saying I don't have an ass?

1439
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,419
I'm saying your ass is there,
but it's not too much.

1440
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:52,630
- I'm changing again.
- No.

1441
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:56,175
You know, sweetheart,

1442
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:58,678
I really should get over there
so I could sit down with the producer

1443
01:15:58,845 --> 01:16:00,179
and go over with what
I'm gonna say.

1444
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:01,722
That would
really help me a lot.

1445
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:02,974
- All right.
- Okay.

1446
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:04,934
- What do you think?
- Fabulous.

1447
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,686
- I really...
- Nope.

1448
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,229
I like that dress.

1449
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:12,525
Sometimes people on the way,
they throw up in my car.

1450
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:14,193
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1451
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,362
Okay, let's go.

1452
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:19,740
- You look pretty.
- Thank you. You're so sweet.

1453
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:22,827
Thanks. Which one of you
is on the show?

1454
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,495
- I am.
- Oh.

1455
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:26,664
- No, you're gonna do great.
- Thanks.

1456
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,500
Hi, Lance clayton
for the "Dr. Dana" show.

1457
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,377
- Hi, guys.
- Dr. P.

1458
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:34,046
Lance, hi. Jerry Klein...
we spoke on the phone.

1459
01:16:34,214 --> 01:16:35,881
- Mm-hmm.
- We can let them in.

1460
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:38,551
Follow me. We can go right in.
We're running a little late.

1461
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,511
- You guys hit some traffic, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

1462
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:42,054
- Ah, wonderful.
- This is claire, my girlfriend.

1463
01:16:42,222 --> 01:16:43,764
- Hi, claudia. Jerry Klein.
- Claire.

1464
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,350
We're not gonna have time
to go through the notes

1465
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:47,893
in the greenroom
as we planned,

1466
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:49,395
- so we're gonna do it in makeup.
- Makeup?

1467
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,397
- And that's this way. Claudia?
- Claire.

1468
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,774
Thank you so much for sending
the photos of Kyle. They're beautiful.

1469
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,568
- And also the book.
- I sent the book.

1470
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,361
Is she gonna be holding up
the back of the book?

1471
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:59,530
That's a director question.
I'm a segment producer.

1472
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,616
How do we know
when the camera is on me?

1473
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,118
You're gonna be
in the friends-and-family section.

1474
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,911
Could you grab a seat?

1475
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:07,622
Okay, yeah. Sure.

1476
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:10,499
I just have a couple of issues
to discuss with Lance.

1477
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,627
- Lance, do you have questions?
- No no.

1478
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,211
- Look over here, please.
- Good. Good.

1479
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:16,881
So, Lance, if you should start
to talk about your son...

1480
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,175
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
... and begin to cry, or well up...

1481
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:20,384
- Okay.
... just go with it.

1482
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:22,053
Don't be ashamed, okay?

1483
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,429
- Yeah.
- And if you cry...

1484
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:24,972
- Mm-hmm.
... look up.

1485
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,474
- No, look down, please.
- Oh.

1486
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,142
- Don't look down. Look up.
- Can you look down?

1487
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,894
- Don't tuck your chin.
- Oh.

1488
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:32,355
And above all,
don't be nervous.

1489
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:34,190
Lance, hi.

1490
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,484
- Look this way, please.
- I don't mean to bug you right now.

1491
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,569
My name is Bert Green.
I'm with with McKenna Artist.

1492
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,155
- Hi, Bert.
- Your son's memoir is so strong.

1493
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,866
My God, it's so moving.
My heart goes out to you.

1494
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,409
Mm-hmm.

1495
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:47,495
- Oh, thank you.
- Have you been talking to publishers?

1496
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,330
- No.
- Because I honestly think this could be

1497
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:50,790
the biggest posthumous
autobiography

1498
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:52,333
since "The Diary
of Anne Frank," honestly.

1499
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,417
- Really?
- Oh my God.

1500
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:56,087
You know
what she's done for...

1501
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:57,963
Yes.
Yeah, that's huge.

1502
01:17:58,131 --> 01:18:00,091
Look, I'm gonna get out
of your hair right now.

1503
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:01,550
But if any of this
interests you,

1504
01:18:01,718 --> 01:18:03,010
- give me a call, okay?
- Okay.

1505
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,762
Just give me a ring.
It's great to meet you.

1506
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:07,807
Great to meet you.
Go out there and kill 'em.

1507
01:18:07,974 --> 01:18:10,309
- Do it.
- Okay.

1508
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:14,271
- Now I'm nervous.
- Oh, great.

1509
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:15,898
- It's go time, all right?
- Okay.

1510
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,526
So again, Lance,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1511
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,986
And let's have a great show.

1512
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:31,956
My guest today
is Mr. Lance clayton.

1513
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:36,252
Lance's 15-year-old son
Kyle tragically took his own life.

1514
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,796
But from this terrible
story of loss

1515
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,881
arose one of hope.

1516
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:45,261
Here he is to share this powerful
story, Mr. Lance clayton.

1517
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:50,015
- Thanks so much forjoining us.
- Thank you, Doctor.

1518
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:52,601
We know it takes great
courage for you to do this.

1519
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:55,062
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1520
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:57,314
Now, Lance...

1521
01:18:57,482 --> 01:18:59,650
is it all right
if I call you Lance?

1522
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:00,735
Yes, that's my name.

1523
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:07,450
One of the most difficult things
is for a parent to lose a child.

1524
01:19:07,617 --> 01:19:10,369
Yes. Yes it is.

1525
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:12,955
Tell us about
your son Kyle.

1526
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:22,631
It's difficult, isn't it?

1527
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:25,509
Yeah.

1528
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:28,429
He was a sweet boy.

1529
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,185
Kind.

1530
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,565
I'm sorry.
He was a sweet boy.

1531
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:48,199
I'm sorry.

1532
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:50,117
But there was
a lot brewing underneath?

1533
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:54,121
The tragedy is I didn't
know until his death

1534
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:56,874
how sad he was
or profound.

1535
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:00,795
Mmm.

1536
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,755
Here's a tissue
for you.

1537
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:06,133
Profound.
Indeed profound.

1538
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:07,468
Indeed.

1539
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,095
"You don't know me. "

1540
01:20:10,263 --> 01:20:12,139
This is so beautifully
written.

1541
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,975
I just...
you know, the thing is,

1542
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:18,312
I didn't know... I'm so proud of him.
He was a great writer.

1543
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,398
Yes, this is really
remarkable work.

1544
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:23,776
No matter what page
I turn to,

1545
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:27,780
there's something here
that really moves me.

1546
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,824
- I want to read this.
- Okay.

1547
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:33,702
"Is it more important
for me to be a good person

1548
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:36,831
or to be thought
of as a good person?

1549
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,708
I'm so sick
of living a life in fear

1550
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:42,545
of being found out
for the phony I am,

1551
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:45,548
a life where I don't trust
anyone's intentions,

1552
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:49,009
including my own. "

1553
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,511
Wow, that is really deep.

1554
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:54,557
Hard to imagine that it was
written by a 15-year-old.

1555
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:57,643
- He was an old soul.
- Mmm.

1556
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:01,188
You know, I'm not gonna pretend
that I know what's going on

1557
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,023
in the mind of a teenager.

1558
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:05,442
All I'm saying is,
Kyle made a mistake.

1559
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:07,486
If you're that depressed,

1560
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:10,364
reach out to someone.

1561
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,659
And remember, suicide
is a permanent solution

1562
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:15,286
to temporary problems.

1563
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:19,582
- You want my job?
- No. Please, Dana, no. Thank you.

1564
01:21:19,749 --> 01:21:23,043
Again, the book,
"You Don't Know Me. "

1565
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:25,337
And my guest has been
Lance clayton.

1566
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:28,299
Thank you.

1567
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:30,676
You were so good!

1568
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:33,220
Thanks, doll.

1569
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,890
And I'm so glad
you used my title.

1570
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:37,433
It's a great title.

1571
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,728
Hello?

1572
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,521
Lance, hi.
It's Bert Green.

1573
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,190
- Hi.
- You were so great on "Dr. Dana. "

1574
01:21:45,358 --> 01:21:47,109
Oh, thanks, Bert.

1575
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:50,112
It was like...
it was like watching a ballet.

1576
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:52,531
Hey, do you have time
to meet tomorrow?

1577
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:54,450
Because there's
a number of publishers

1578
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,952
who are dying

1579
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,331
- to meet with you.
- Well, really, no.

1580
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:02,416
Actually we have
to head back tomorrow.

1581
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,628
They're dedicating
the school library in Kyle's honor.

1582
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:08,005
Good for him.
I mean, good for you.

1583
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:09,715
That's good.

1584
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,301
Hey, let's do it soon.

1585
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,511
Because this book is hot.

1586
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:18,182
It's like a volcano
on the sun.

1587
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,392
Wow. That's a lot of heat.

1588
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,852
I'm gonna get a hold
of you soon.

1589
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,271
Okay? Bye.

1590
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:56,428
Lance, Lance.

1591
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:58,222
Oh, God.
I'm glad I caught you.

1592
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59,974
Oh, your book
is on fire.

1593
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:01,433
- Oh.
- It is.

1594
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:03,602
This is...
this is Bill Tobin.

1595
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:05,104
- Hi.
- From Simon & Simon.

1596
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,272
- Carl Klienman from Howard Publishing.
- Hi.

1597
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,484
And this is George Kenny,
from Kaufmann Press.

1598
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,486
They love your book
and they wanna meet with you.

1599
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:14,405
- It's true.
- Really.

1600
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:16,281
We're not gonna bother
with that right now.

1601
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:19,326
They're gonna have a chance to talk
with you after the dedication, okay?

1602
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,619
- Good.
- Okay?

1603
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:25,457
And they also want
a book of yours too.

1604
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:28,794
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

1605
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:31,171
- Okay.
- See you in there.

1606
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,804
I'm so proud of you,
lamb chop.

1607
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,556
Thanks.

1608
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:48,772
Mr. Clayton.

1609
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:50,232
Bruce Hornsby.

1610
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,317
We wrote Mr. Hornsby
and he came.

1611
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:54,319
Hey, man, when I heard
what a fan Kyle was

1612
01:23:54,487 --> 01:23:56,363
I thought,
how can I say no?

1613
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:57,573
All: Aw.

1614
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,534
- Thanks.
- Girl: God, he's so sweet.

1615
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:11,712
Girl:
Bruce Hornsby.

1616
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:19,595
I'd like to dedicate
this song to my biggest fan,

1617
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:23,682
Kyle clayton.

1618
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:41,408
# Another song
came and went #

1619
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:44,536
# Like the times
that we spent #

1620
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:47,581
# Hiding out
from the rain #

1621
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:51,210
# Under the carnival tent #

1622
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:54,713
# I laughed
and she'd smile #

1623
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:57,591
# It would last
for awhile #

1624
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,927
# You don't know
what you got #

1625
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,972
# Till you lose it
all again #

1626
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:06,809
# Listen to
the mandolin rain #

1627
01:25:06,976 --> 01:25:09,895
# Listen to the music
on the lake #

1628
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:13,273
# Listen to
my heart break #

1629
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:16,527
# Every time
she runs away #

1630
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:19,780
# Listen to
the banjo wind #

1631
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:23,450
# A sad song
drifting low #

1632
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,786
# Listen to
the tears roll #

1633
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:30,040
# Down my face
as she turns to go #

1634
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:33,127
# Listen to the tears
as they roll #

1635
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:36,797
# Down my face
as she turns to go. #

1636
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:49,852
Mr. Clayton,

1637
01:25:50,019 --> 01:25:52,938
I want you to know that

1638
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:56,233
I've always felt
not enough.

1639
01:25:56,401 --> 01:26:01,155
My dad
rides me all the time.

1640
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:03,031
He calls me a loser.

1641
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:07,411
I almost killed myself

1642
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:09,955
until Kyle's note
and book came out.

1643
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:13,876
It saved my life.

1644
01:26:15,795 --> 01:26:18,922
I know he's looking
down on you so proud.

1645
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:24,511
Thanks, Pete.

1646
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,856
Thank you,
Bruce Hornsby.

1647
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:40,027
Welcome students,
faculty

1648
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,362
and guests.

1649
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,364
Today

1650
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:47,367
we celebrate Kyle.

1651
01:26:49,245 --> 01:26:51,580
Kyle has shown us
so many things;

1652
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:53,790
how fleeting the time

1653
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:56,293
we spend on this earth
really is.

1654
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,755
Kyle did not die in vain.

1655
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:04,593
Through his book and through
our hearts he will live on.

1656
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:09,181
Today we dedicate
this library

1657
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:11,725
in his spirit...

1658
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,561
a tribute to his deep
intelligence

1659
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:18,732
and to the profound impact
he made on all of us

1660
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:23,445
in the brief time we were
fortunate enough to know him.

1661
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:27,074
And now to accept
this honor on his behalf,

1662
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,326
I give you his father,

1663
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:31,411
Mr. Lance clayton.

1664
01:28:25,174 --> 01:28:27,467
You guys
didn't like Kyle.

1665
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:30,679
But that's okay,
I didn't either.

1666
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,850
I loved him.

1667
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:37,519
He was my son,

1668
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:40,981
but he was also
a douche bag.

1669
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:48,864
He wasn't very smart

1670
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:51,325
and he didn't kill
himself.

1671
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:58,165
Kyle died accidentally
while masturbating.

1672
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:05,380
I made it look like
a suicide

1673
01:29:05,548 --> 01:29:08,633
and I wrote
a suicide note.

1674
01:29:13,389 --> 01:29:16,808
I also wrote his journal.
Thank you.

1675
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:33,784
Thanks.

1676
01:29:33,951 --> 01:29:37,287
You are an asshole.

1677
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:38,997
Yeah.

1678
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:41,208
Lance's voice: I used to think
the worst thing in life

1679
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,502
was to end up all alone.

1680
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:45,879
It's not.

1681
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,340
The worst thing in life
is ending up with people

1682
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,801
who make you feel
all alone.

1683
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:54,763
# Pressure pushing down
on me #

1684
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:58,558
# Pressing down on you,
no man asked for #

1685
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:00,727
# Under pressure #

1686
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:03,146
# That burns
a building down #

1687
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:05,399
# Splits a family in two #

1688
01:30:05,566 --> 01:30:08,068
# Puts people on streets #

1689
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:12,197
# Um ba ba be #

01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:15,826
# De day da,

1691
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:18,161
# It's the terror
of knowing #

1692
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:20,747
# What this world
is about #

1693
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:24,668
# Watching some good friends
screaming, "Let me out" #

1694
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:29,089
# Pray tomorrow
gets me higher #

1695
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:33,135
# Pressure on people,
people on streets #

1696
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:36,721
# Day day de mm hm #

# Kick my brains
around the floor #

1700
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:50,902
# These are the days
it never rains but it pours #

1701
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:55,115
# Ee do ba be

# People on streets,

1705
01:31:07,253 --> 01:31:10,797
# It's the terror of knowing

1706
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:15,594
# Watching some good friends
screaming, "Let me out" #

1707
01:31:15,761 --> 01:31:19,973
# Pray tomorrow
gets me higher high high #

1708
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:24,227
# Pressure on people,
people on streets #

1709
01:31:26,355 --> 01:31:31,151
# Turned away from it all
like a blind man #

1710
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,696
# Sat on a fence
but it don't work #

1711
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:36,990
# Keep coming up
with love #

1712
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:39,201
# But it's so slashed
and torn #

1713
01:31:39,368 --> 01:31:43,997
# Why?
Why? Why? #

1714
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:54,508
# Love love love
love love #

1715
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:58,053
# Insanity laughs
under pressure we're breaking #

1716
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:01,848
# can't we give ourselves
one more chance? #

1717
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:05,852
# Why can't we give love
that one more chance? #

1718
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:10,941
# Why can't we give love
give love give love give love #

1719
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:14,653
# Give love give love give love
give love give love #

1720
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:19,908
# 'cause love's
such an old-fashioned word #

1721
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:23,995
# And love dares you to care #

1722
01:32:24,163 --> 01:32:30,377
# For the people on the edge
of the night #

1723
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:35,382
# And love dares
you to change our way #

1724
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:40,095
# Of caring about ourselves #

1725
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:48,395
# This is our last dance #

1726
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:52,482
# This is ourselves #

1727
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:59,030
# Under pressure #

1728
01:33:01,492 --> 01:33:03,618
# Pressure. #

1729
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:22,846
I knew you
wrote the book.

1730
01:33:27,476 --> 01:33:28,768
I liked it.

1731
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:31,688
- Really?
- You're a good writer.

1732
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:34,107
I think
you should keep writing.

1733
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,110
Thanks, Andrew. I will.

1734
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:40,322
Hey, Andrew.

1735
01:33:40,489 --> 01:33:42,699
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1736
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:45,243
Do you want something
to eat?

1737
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:47,537
I'd like that
very much, sir.

1738
01:33:47,705 --> 01:33:49,205
I'm vegetarian.

1739
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:51,416
I know.

1740
01:33:55,421 --> 01:34:09,059
# Yeah #

1741
01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:13,855
# I've always been
this way #

1742
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:17,567
# Never known
any other way to feel #

1743
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:22,113
# Got the right of way #

1744
01:34:22,281 --> 01:34:26,117
# And all of the others
must yield #

1745
01:34:26,285 --> 01:34:30,622
# Now I'm naked #

1746
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:34,250
# And I'm in school #

1747
01:34:34,418 --> 01:34:38,630
# I can't make it #

1748
01:34:38,798 --> 01:34:40,256
# To the door #

1749
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,761
# Yeah #

1750
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:48,932
# Try to understand #

1751
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:52,936
# That an oyster can only
make a pearl #

1752
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:57,315
# From a grain of sand #

1753
01:34:57,483 --> 01:35:01,277
# But from what I don't know
makes a girl #

1754
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:05,615
# But I'm trying #

1755
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,826
# Not to laugh #

1756
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:14,082
# Inside I'm dying #

1757
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,209
- # When we break #
- # When we will break #

1758
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:18,294
- # Apart #
- # Apart #

1759
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:20,380
- # Then you take #
- # Then you take #

1760
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:22,549
- # Back your heart #
- # Back your heart #

1761
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:26,511
# And it aches in the dark #

1762
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:30,515
# But it makes #

1763
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:33,893
# A tiny spark #

1764
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:45,363
# I've always been this way #

1765
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:49,159
# Never known
any other way to feel #

1766
01:35:49,326 --> 01:35:53,288
# Got the right of way #

1767
01:35:53,456 --> 01:35:57,584
# And all of the others
must yield #

1768
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:01,838
# Now I'm naked #

1769
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:05,800
# And I'm in school #

1770
01:36:05,968 --> 01:36:10,096
# I can't make it #

1771
01:36:10,264 --> 01:36:12,223
# To the door #

1772
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:18,563
# We were lying #

1773
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:20,190
# In the grass #

1774
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:27,697
# I was trying #

1775
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:31,159
# Oh, not to laugh #

1776
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:35,538
# I was drowning #

1777
01:36:35,706 --> 01:36:40,585
# In the past. #

1778
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:49,344
# I know the way #

1779
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:52,055
# To lose my cares #

1780
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:54,641
# When this boy's burdens #

1781
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:57,352
# Are too much to bear #

1782
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,896
# I'm up in a cloud #

1783
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:02,565
# Flying in the sky #

1784
01:37:02,733 --> 01:37:05,276
# I float away #

1785
01:37:05,444 --> 01:37:08,071
# When I get high
high high #

1786
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,240
# Folks toss and turn #

1787
01:37:10,407 --> 01:37:12,826
# And walk the floor #

1788
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:15,620
# When that old wolf
aooh aooh aooh! #

1789
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:18,081
# Is outside the door #

1790
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:20,917
# I'll roll the reefer #

1791
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:23,586
# If wolfy brings the rye #

1792
01:37:23,754 --> 01:37:26,381
# Let's drink and puff,
yeah yeah #

1793
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:29,092
# When I get high... #

1794
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:32,136
come on, Mr. Wolf,
let's blow this house down.

1795
01:37:32,304 --> 01:37:34,764
Oh, is that the best you can do?

1796
01:37:34,932 --> 01:37:38,059
Aha. Back off, son,
let me try.

1797
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:44,774
Ahh. Yeah!

1798
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:46,818
I don't even care
about pigs.

1799
01:37:46,986 --> 01:37:49,779
I don't care
about anything.

1800
01:37:49,947 --> 01:37:52,323
# When things are tough #

1801
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:55,076
# And I've had enough #

1802
01:37:55,244 --> 01:37:57,829
# When life gets rough #

1803
01:37:57,997 --> 01:38:00,415
# I just light up #

1804
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:03,042
# Blues can't catch me #

1805
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,712
# They don't even try #

1806
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,256
# I just look down
laughing #

1807
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:11,092
# When I get high
high high #

1808
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:12,468
# I get high! #

1809
01:38:12,636 --> 01:38:15,680
Oh-ho-ho, I must be wearing
my elevator shoes.
