1
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,300
I always believed
it was the things you don't choose

2
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,500
that makes you who you are.

3
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,100
Your city.

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,100
Your neighborhood.

5
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,500
Your family.

6
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,600
People here take pride in these things.

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,500
Like it was something
they'd accomplished.

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,100
The bodies around their souls.

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,100
The cities wrapped around those.

10
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,800
I lived on this block my whole life.

11
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,300
Most of these people have.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,700
When your job is to find people
who are missing,

13
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,400
it helps to know where they started.

14
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,200
I find the people
who started in the cracks,

15
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,200
and then fell through.

16
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,400
This city can be hard.

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,900
When I was young, I asked my priest
how you could get to heaven

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,100
and still protect yourself
from all the evil in the world.

19
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,400
He told me what God said
to his children.

20
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,800
"You are sheep among wolves,

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
"be wise as serpents,

22
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,000
"yet innocent as doves."

23
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,700
You live just across the street.
Is that right, ma'am?

24
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,100
That one on the corner,
that's our house.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,800
You know, to get Annette
in high school, you have...

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,400
- I heard they had an opening.
- Yeah, me, too.

27
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,300
The thing is, she always
had a smile on her face.

28
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,600
That was her. She was always smiling.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
I mean, who would take my little girl?

30
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,600
She never hurt anybody,
never caused...

31
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,200
Whoever you are, if you have her,

32
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,500
you just let her go.

33
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,100
Now, we won't charge you,

34
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,700
but if you're out there,
just let her come home.

35
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,600
All right? Let her come home.

36
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,800
I mean,
who would take my little girl?

37
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,300
- You fucking cops.
- She never caused no trouble,

38
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,800
she never got in any fights,
she's a sweetheart.

39
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,000
- This is just unbelievable.
- She was a good kid.

40
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,200
The whole force
standing outside the house,

41
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,200
guarding the sidewalk
with their arms crossed.

42
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,000
I mean, are the kidnappers
coming back?

43
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,100
Amanda McCready
was taken from her home

44
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,900
between 8:00 and 8:30
Wednesday night.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,700
She's four years old,
has blond hair and green eyes...

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,900
...weighs 35 pounds
and is 40 inches tall.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,300
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah. I know.

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,200
A beleaguered
police force and a weary citizenry

50
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,600
have been left with so little to cling to.

51
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,700
A blanket, a back door,
and a doll named Mirabelle.

52
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,500
The neighborhood's
really coming together.

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,700
We're gonna have a rally.

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,300
Everyone's gonna have a vigil.
We're gonna have a vigil tonight.

55
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,100
You know, the neighborhood's all alert,

56
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,500
everybody's alert of what's going on
and everything that...

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,000
The surroundings. We got flyers up,
posters up, we have all that stuff up.

58
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,100
So everybody's well aware
and everybody's looking for Amanda.

59
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,500
In related news,
the Boston police captain

60
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,300
responsible for preventing
crimes against children

61
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,800
spoke a few words a moment ago,

62
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,400
words of comfort.

63
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,900
I know the pain of losing a daughter.
We will not fail.

64
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,200
We will pursue every avenue.

65
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,500
Do you know the mother?

66
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,400
Captain Jack Doyle on
details of the missing Dorchester girl...

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,800
Little bit.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.

68
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,600
She was blowing Mike Gulley
down the post

69
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,100
when he was still 14 and innocent
and milking cows up Vermont.

70
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,700
I don't know about innocent.

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400
Her mother says Amanda
may be carrying a little girl of her own.

72
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,800
Mirabelle was last seen with Amanda.
It's her favorite doll.

73
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,100
This is horrible.

74
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,100
- Not if you're Channel 9.
- Turn it off.

75
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,300
Good night.

76
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,500
- Hey, Angie. Get the door?
I'm in the bathroom.

77
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,300
It's 7:00! Seven in the fucking morning!

78
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,500
What?

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,600
Are you Patrick Kenzie?

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
- Yeah.
- Bea and Lionel McCready.

81
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,500
Our niece was kidnapped
three days ago.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Please, come on in. Come on in.
I have to apologize.

83
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,800
You know, there's been some problems
with kids in the neighborhood,

84
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,300
kind of ding-dong ditch,
ringing the buzzer and running away.

85
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
So that's the reason for the language.

86
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,200
- Oh.
- Well, we can come back later.

87
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,800
No. Please, please.
Make yourself comfortable.

88
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,600
Here, we're just...
I'm sorry about the mess.

89
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,800
We've been...
I had a late case, and a lot of cases.

90
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,500
We've just been...
We've just been working a lot,

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,800
we worked on a case last night,
you know, so we just...

92
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,800
Please sit down, though.

93
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,600
Or...

94
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,600
My associate'll be in in just a minute.
She's in the other room.

95
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
How can we help you?

96
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,500
Do you know people
in the neighborhood

97
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,900
who don't talk to the police?

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,600
Yeah, one or two.

99
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,800
We wanna hire you to augment
the investigation of Amanda.

100
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,000
Is that right?

101
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,200
You know how in JonBenet Ramsey
the family hired investigators?

102
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,000
So... Are the police all right
with youse hiring outside help?

103
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,600
The police need to worry
about finding my niece.

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,800
Hi. I'm Angie Gennaro.
I work with Patrick.

105
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,000
Hello. I'm Bea McCready.
This is my husband, Lionel.

106
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,400
- How do you do?
- They wanna hire us

107
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
to augment the investigation.

108
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,000
You should talk
to Precision Investigators.

109
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,700
- Who? I...
- I don't know, I meant...

110
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, let's hear them out, Ange.

111
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,700
Well, aren't you
missing persons detectives?

112
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,500
Yeah, that's what your ad says
in the paper.

113
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, we are.
We are missing persons detectives.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,700
I'm sorry, she...
I think that what Angie means to say is,

115
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,500
just for the sake of disclosure,
up to this point,

116
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,400
our experience has been primarily,
you know, finding missing persons

117
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,400
who've gone missing that they...

118
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,300
You know, they just stop payments on
their Jet Ski

119
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
and they went to New Hampshire...

120
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,800
Every police officer in this state
is looking for your niece right now.

121
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,800
And I'm not sure
how much more help we could be.

122
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,300
Well, you're not gonna
do any harm, are you?

123
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,800
All right, look.
I got a pension coming up with Edison.

124
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,300
- So, that's collateral, if...
- No. It's not that.

125
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,200
Why is this so hard?
The cops don't want me coming here.

126
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,600
- Lionel don't want me coming here.
- Don't worry.

127
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,100
- Now you don't want the job?
- No, it's not that we don't want the job...

128
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,600
We consult privately
before we make decisions like these.

129
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,300
- We do.
- Helene puts her to bed.

130
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,500
She goes across to Dottie's.
Maybe gone a half hour, watches TV.

131
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,000
Then she comes home
and Amanda is gone.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,500
She was watching Wife Swap.

133
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,700
She remembers,
'cause that's her favorite show.

134
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,100
And do youse two live upstairs?

135
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,200
Yeah, when our folks died
they left us a unit and my sister a unit,

136
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,000
so, you know,
basically we got no choice.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,200
And with the acoustics
in the apartment,

138
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,300
you can't get away from it.

139
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,200
Why don't you just
come over the house, all right?

140
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,300
- Just talk to Helene, you know.
Lionel, talk to Helene?

141
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,600
Look, she don't show it,
but she's hurting right now.

142
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,300
- Please. Please!
- All right. Lookit, all right?

143
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,900
I was no saint. All right?
I had my own problems.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,200
I took a hard bust at 22.
Bea straightened me out.

145
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,700
My sister Helene has not had that.

146
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Talking to the mother's
the least we could do.

147
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,700
- We'll come right over.
- Thanks a lot.

148
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,200
Yeah. Pleasure, Lionel.

149
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,500
Oh, you'll find us
in that brown three-decker by the park.

150
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,000
- You know where it is.
- Be hard to miss today.

151
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,900
Look at this. Jesus.

152
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,000
Fucking block party here.

153
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,400
Four Cape Verdeans
got killed here last year.

154
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,400
No one gave a shit.

155
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,500
We have a good life, right?

156
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,600
Is that a trick question?

157
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,100
I don't wanna find their little kid
in a dumpster.

158
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,600
Maybe she's not in a dumpster, babe.

159
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,400
I don't wanna find a little kid after
they've been abused for three days.

160
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,100
Hon, nobody does.

161
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,900
All right.

162
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,900
Listen, we'll just go up
and we'll talk to them,

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,900
and you don't wanna do it after that,
I won't argue with you.

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,100
Okay.

165
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,800
Hi. Please, come on in.

166
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
Helene.

167
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,700
This is Patrick Kenzie,
Angela Gennaro.

168
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,700
- Hi.
- I remember you from high school.

169
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,200
I see you're still a little conceited, huh?

170
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,700
Would you excuse us, Dottie?

171
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,900
Dottie's my best friend, Lionel.
She could be in my house if she wants.

172
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,200
Helene, we don't wanna
get in your hair.

173
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,400
We're just gonna ask you
a couple questions

174
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,200
about your daughter,
then we'll be out of here.

175
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,000
- Everyone wants their part now.
- I know.

176
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,900
I already talked to the cops forty times.

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
- We're sorry to take up your time.
- Listen, we're not the cops.

178
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,400
Beatrice asked us to come over here

179
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,100
and see if we could help out
finding your daughter.

180
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,500
Why don't Bea mind her business?
It's my kid.

181
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,700
'Cause everyone gotta
have their moment, now.

182
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
- Right?
- Right.

183
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,200
Beatrice hired these people to help
find Amanda with her own money,

184
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,200
so you had better show them
the goddamn courtesy

185
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
- and respect they deserve!
- She's in grieving, prick.

186
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,800
She could grieve
how she wants, Dottie.

187
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,100
- You don't live here!
- Asshole.

188
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't you fucking yell at her, Lionel.
You ain't her father!

189
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,000
Fuck you, Lionel.

190
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,500
Go fuck yourself. Cocksucker.
Fuck you.

191
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,300
Get the fuck outta here.

192
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,700
- I'm sorry.
- Maybe we should go.

194
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,200
- I understand. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

195
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Maybe we should go?

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,800
Look. Can we all just have a few words
in the hallway, please?

197
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,100
Excuse us, Helene.

198
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,900
- Helene's got emotional problems.
- It's not that, Lionel.

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,700
- What is it, then?
- She's a cunt!

200
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,200
- Beatrice, don't use that word.
- God help me, it's true.

201
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,500
This is a child.
And I don't know where she is.

202
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,300
Well...

203
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
We can't do any harm, right?

204
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,100
It's all right, Bea.
It's all right, Bea. Huh?

205
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,900
Thank you.

206
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,400
Now...

207
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,900
Well, she's quiet.
She tries very hard to be a good girl.

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,300
What about Helene? Her friends?
People she hangs out with?

209
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,700
She got a lot of people
come by the house?

210
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't know.
She's at the Fillmore all the time.

211
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,800
She's at the Fillmore Lounge?

212
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Yeah, she drinks every day.

213
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,200
She's got the gene, you know?
The disease. Our parents had it, too.

214
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,200
She use drugs?

215
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,100
I think she does a little coke.

216
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,300
How much is a little?

217
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,100
I don't know. Few times a week, maybe.
I mean, how much is a lot?

218
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,600
Few times a week's a lot.

219
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,800
Then she does a lot.
I don't know anything about that.

220
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,300
I put the plug in the jug myself,
I got 23 years sobriety, so, I'm good.

221
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,700
Congratulations.

222
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,900
Do you mind if we see her room?

223
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,700
- Kidnapped the furniture, too?
- Patrick.

224
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,100
10-7 investigation.

225
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,000
Solved it yet?

226
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,500
Captain, Patrick Kenzie.
This is my associate, Angie Gennaro.

227
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,900
Mmm-hmm?

228
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,900
I see Beatrice went on
and hired someone.

229
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,000
I take it that wasn't
your recommendation.

230
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,300
It was not.

231
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,400
That woman would mortgage her home
to every snake doctor

232
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,500
taking credit cards if she thought
it would help find her niece.

233
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,900
My job's hard enough
without inviting the circus in here.

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,500
Captain, this isn't
about the money for us.

235
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,700
You ever investigated
an abduction before?

236
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,200
I think Mrs. McCready was hoping
we could help

237
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,500
with the neighborhood aspect of this
investigation, the people, you know.

238
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,200
How old are you?

239
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,100
- I'm 31.
- He just looks young.

240
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,000
A four-year-old child is on the street.

241
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,700
It's 76 hours and counting.

242
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,400
And the prospects
for where she might be

243
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,900
are beginning to look grim,
you understand?

244
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,900
Half of all the children in these cases
are killed, flat out.

245
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,300
If we don't catch the abductor
by day one,

246
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,200
only about 10% are ever solved.

247
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
This is day three.

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,900
He may look young,

249
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,100
but if he wants to work this case,
he'd better not act it.

250
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,800
Well, he's been hired by a woman
who's the victim of a crime,

251
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,200
and by law he's entitled
as her representative

252
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,300
to be cooperated with
by the Boston Police Department.

253
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,900
So he expects to be.

254
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,100
And he will be.

255
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,700
He and his better half will be contacted
by two of my senior men,

256
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,500
at their convenience,
and be permitted to observe.

257
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,100
We're just trying to help, Captain.

258
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,200
Look, I don't care who does it.
I just want it done.

259
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,900
Good afternoon.

260
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,200
Ready to get started?

261
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,800
All I'm saying is that
we heard Helene comes in here.

262
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,700
We're not asking
for the combination to the safe.

263
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,500
Listen, I ain't saying a fucking word.
I already talked to the fucking cops.

264
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,800
All right.

265
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,200
- Dave, right?
- Big Dave.

266
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,500
Big Dave. All right.

267
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,800
I'm Medium Patrick. Nice to meet you.

268
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,200
You're a little fucking light in the ass
to be talking shit, ain't ya?

269
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,300
Jesus, pal,
I'm just playing.

270
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,500
Listen, buy a couple
of fucking drinks or screw.

271
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,800
Okay, we'll take a couple tonics.

272
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,700
Jesus Christ.

273
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,100
Steve Penteroudakis!
The Grecian Formula!

274
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,700
Oh, shit! What are you doing here?

275
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,100
Look at this little motherfucker
at the Fillmore, what's up?

276
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,400
Gyro!

277
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,600
Beers and keno, 2:00 in the afternoon.

278
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,900
- What up?
- Oh, yeah.

279
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,500
Yeah, listen,
I been fucking everywhere

280
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,600
putting up posters, man, you know?

281
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,600
Every project hallway,
all over City Point, everywhere.

282
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,700
You know? I mean, it's a real tragedy.

283
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,600
She used to come in here,
sit up at the bar and shit.

284
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,900
- You know, she was like our mascot.
- Helene brought Amanda in here?

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,800
No, mostly in the afternoons.
I mean, it's no place for a child at night.

286
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,500
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

287
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,000
Hot tempers, lot of drugs, trust me.

288
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,500
So how often Helene come down here?

289
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,000
Five nights a week.

290
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,900
Come on, guys, please.
She's a fucking coke ho, okay?

291
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,200
She's in here fucking doing lines
just about every night.

292
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,200
Trust me, all right?
It's not a real shocker, so...

293
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,200
- She's that bad, huh?
- Huh?

294
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,900
Oh, she's fucking terrible.

295
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,700
Listen, remember that night
when the kid got kidnapped?

296
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,800
You saw her on the news, right?

297
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,600
She's saying, "Oh, I was at my
neighbor's house for a half hour."

298
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,800
Bullshit. She was in here for, like,
two hours bumping rails. Oh, yeah.

299
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,300
What time did she come in?
- 8:00.

300
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,500
- Are you sure it was the same night?
- Fucking positive,

301
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,700
'cause she was in the shitter,
fucking banging down rails with Ray,

302
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,300
and I was banging on the fucking door.

303
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,600
- Who, Ray? Skinny Ray?
- Yeah. Ray Likanski.

304
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,500
He's in there ducking me
like a fucking faggot.

305
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
I was banging on the door.

306
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,700
He thought I didn't know
he was in there,

307
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,300
but I know he's fucking in there.

308
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,400
- Don't lend him any money...
- Hey, Stevie.

309
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,500
- What the fuck you doing?
- Nothing. What's up, Lenny?

310
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,600
Don't talk about people you don't know.

311
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,000
What do you mean?
These are my friends.

312
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,200
- I know them for years.
- What's the problem, guy?

313
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,500
You said you weren't a cop.
Right, "guy"?

314
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,300
- Yeah, I'm not a cop.
- Yeah, then why don't you fuck off?

315
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,200
Why don't you mind your business?

316
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,600
He's gonna come in here
and be a smartass?

317
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,100
You're awfully worried
about people's asses there, Dave.

318
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,400
Yeah, you probably got
a fucking ass like a Skippy jar.

319
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,300
What are you doing here, anyway?
Dave can't make a martini worth a shit.

320
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,000
Trying to help Helene
find her daughter. Is that all right?

321
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,500
Listen, don't come in here
running your mouth,

322
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,200
thinking you're better than me.

323
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,500
I'm not the fucking one.

324
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,400
- All right, just cool it.
Cool it.

325
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,400
- Listen to this douchebag.
- Bet she fucks this asshole in half.

326
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,600
Jesus Christ. What the fuck
is the matter with you guys?

327
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,000
You, you punk fucking jackass.

328
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,000
We're leaving, all right?

329
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
You know, Dave,
I think it's your good looks...

330
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,500
'Cause there is some fine pussy
in here tonight.

331
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,400
Open that door, rummy.

332
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,400
- Open the door, Mike.
- Now.

333
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
You ever wanna get fucked,
let me know.

334
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,200
How's that, motherfucker?
Now you know.

335
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Keep your fucking mouths closed.

336
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,200
What, you wanna
say some shit, Fat Dave?

337
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

338
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,600
Make me a martini,
you fucking fat bastard!

339
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
- Make it!
- Get the fuck out.

340
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,100
Make me a fucking martini,
you fat fucking retard!

341
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Fucking unbelievable.

342
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,700
- Can I help you?
- You Detective Bressant?

343
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,800
- That's right.
- Patrick Kenzie. Did you just call me?

344
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,400
Oh, sorry.
Sergeant Detective Remy Bressant.

345
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
How you doing?

346
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,600
- Should we... Sit down?
- Something wrong?

347
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,300
No! I just...

348
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,300
I think Nick was expecting
an older couple, maybe.

349
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,900
Life's full of surprises.

350
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,500
Corwin Earle.
Serial molester, recently work-released.

351
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,100
Went AWOL around the time
Amanda disappeared.

352
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
Known associates, Leon Trett

353
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,800
and his handsome wife, Roberta.

354
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,500
The Tretts were released six
and eight months ago, respectively.

355
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,700
They have drug habits.

356
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,600
We don't know where they are,
but we think Corwin's with them.

357
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,200
Jailhouse snitch claims
that Corwin confided in him

358
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,000
and told him when he got out,
he was gonna move in with his family.

359
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,700
Apparently the three of them

360
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
have some kind of
Addams Family deal going on.

361
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,200
Corwin's plan is to keep a kid
in the house to have sex with.

362
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,700
- Well, that sounds promising.
- Not for Amanda, it doesn't.

363
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,100
Do you think
this is who has Amanda?

364
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,600
Well, there's a lot
of holes in our theory.

365
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,900
I mean, Corwin likes
little boys, you know?

366
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,800
He likes them seven or eight or nine.

367
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,100
So that's it, that's all we got,
there's no other leads, three days in?

368
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,300
No, we got more.

369
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,900
We got six psychics telling us to look
in six different states,

370
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,700
we got Lionel and Bea
with airtight alibis,

371
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,400
we've interviewed every neighbor
in a mile radius

372
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,200
and we got a convicted finger-blaster

373
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,000
who just happened
to cut off his ankle bracelet.

374
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,100
- Take it easy...
- No, no, no, no, no!

375
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Who the fuck is this guy?

376
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,800
You're here because Jack Doyle
had us extend you a courtesy.

377
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,600
You got something to contribute,
you know, be my guest.

378
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,100
Otherwise, hey, you...

379
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,500
You know, you can go back
to your Harry Potter book.

380
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,500
Isn't it usually somebody
who knows the victim?

381
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,800
I think there's plenty of people
in Helene McCready's life

382
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,200
that are capable of doing this.

383
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,900
So then you probably
talked to Ray Likanski.

384
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,100
- Who?
- Ray Likanski.

385
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,700
"Skinny Ray," they call him, 6'2",
about 160 pounds.

386
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,200
Does blow. Helene's boyfriend. No?

387
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,500
- Never heard of him.
- Well, with all due respect,

388
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,700
I think we might be able
to contribute on that point.

389
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,300
- Really? How's that?
- The night Amanda went missing,

390
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,900
Skinny Ray was down
at the Fillmore Lounge

391
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,300
doing coke for two hours,
between 8:00 and 10:00.

392
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,700
Fascinating.

393
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
- With Helene McCready.
- You're shitting me.

394
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,000
She did bullshit us.

395
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,300
I'm gonna have to tear her
a new asshole.

396
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,000
Meet you down there.

397
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,200
So what kinda name is Bressant?

398
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,500
It's the kind they give you in Louisiana.

399
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,100
Oh, yeah?
Thought you were from here.

400
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,100
Well, it all depends
on how you look at it.

401
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,500
I mean, you might think that you're
more from here than me, for example.

402
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,700
But I been living here
longer than you been alive.

403
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,200
So who's right?

404
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,700
I'll mull it over.

405
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,900
- What's up, sucker?
- Bubba.

406
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,300
- Good to see you, brother.
- Good to see you.

407
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,800
- How you been? You been good?
- Yeah.

408
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,300
Yeah? What's up, Angie?
How you doing, baby?

409
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,200
You seen those people?

410
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Drug addict, drug addict, fucking...
Pedophile.

411
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,100
What the fuck makes you think
I know people like this?

412
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,000
Bub, I know you don't pay your rent
doing people's taxes.

413
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,900
Yeah, I don't pay my rent
selling penny rocks

414
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,600
to walleyed child molesters, neither.

415
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,700
They're not all three child molesters.

416
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,100
Just... Just this one, Corwin Earle.

417
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,500
The other two are just baseheads
he hangs out with.

418
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,200
What are the two of yas,
crime dogs, now?

419
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,900
We got hired to find that little girl.

420
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,800
Turns out the mother was down
at the Fillmore all night

421
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,900
while the kid was taken.

422
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,700
- With Skinny Ray.
- Skinny Ray is a fucking bitch.

423
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,500
- I thought Ray was your boy.
- Work for me?

424
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,600
Skinny Ray, he's a fucking cokehead.
He works for the Haitian.

425
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,900
Ray works for Cheese?

426
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,500
Yeah, Cheese, Ray, Chris Mullen,
whole trash-picker crew.

427
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,300
Did you ever sell to Helene?

428
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,300
There's reasons why
there ain't three inches of Plexiglas

429
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,100
between us right now.

430
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,400
That's 'cause I don't fuck
with skeezers like Helene.

431
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,000
Or coconuts like Cheese.

432
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
You should know better by now.

433
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
I'm the king of this
motherfucking jungle.

434
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,200
I'll let you know
if I hear anything, though.

435
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,500
- Thanks, bro.
- Peace.

436
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,400
How well do you know
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

437
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,200
How well do you know
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

438
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,200
- Who?
- Come on, sweetheart.

439
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,100
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

440
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, sounds familiar.

441
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,700
No. No.
It don't "sound familiar," Helene.

442
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:55,200
He's a violent, sociopathic
Haitian criminal named "Cheese."

443
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,000
Either you know him or you don't.

444
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,600
Who is he?

445
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,100
He's a drug lord
or something, isn't he?

446
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,800
Helene, who is he?

447
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,300
- He's just a guy, Lionel.
Thank you.

448
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,900
He is, among other things,
Mrs. McCready, a drug dealer, yes.

449
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,000
- What other things?
- I don't know.

450
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,900
Why don't you answer
your brother's questions, Helene?

451
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,500
Why don't you go
suck a nigger's dick, Bea?

452
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,900
You listen to me!
You don't disrespect my wife,

453
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,700
and you don't make racial remarks
in my kitchen.

454
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,200
- Who is this man?
- It's my kitchen, Lionel.

455
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,300
You know what I mean!

456
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,100
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

457
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,100
He's a drug dealer, a pimp,
a pornographer. All right?

458
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,600
Perfect.
You associate with a pimp.

459
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,500
A pornographer? Helene.

460
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,800
And we think he rolled up
Pokey Jackson in a carpet

461
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,500
and shot him in the head
on Castlegate, so there's that, too.

462
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,500
What do you do for him?

463
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,600
I just mule.

464
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,400
Occasionally, not making
a habit out of it.

465
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,200
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Lionel, what does that mean?

466
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,300
It means she's a drug runner, Bea.
It means she carries drugs.

467
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,800
- Isn't that right, Helene?
- Oh, my God, a few times.

468
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,000
- Where?
- Providence...

469
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,700
Does it fucking matter?

470
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,000
You think I'm fucking around, here?

471
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,500
You think I'm playing games, here?
'Course it matters.

472
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,400
Better answer
his question, Helene.

473
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,000
- For what?
- Fuck's sake, Lionel.

474
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,700
- What do you think? Money, taste.
- Of what, drugs?

475
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,700
No, little puffy heart stickers
for my locker.

476
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,700
What kind of drugs?
Cocaine and heroin.

477
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,600
- No, I would've seen the track marks.
- Not if you snort it. Right, sugar?

478
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,100
Yeah, less addictive that way.

479
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,200
Piece of work.

480
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,600
What the fuck is that?
Where are you going?

481
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,800
Oh, yeah.
I keep thinking about this thing I heard.

482
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,700
- You know where I'm going with this?
- No.

483
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,500
Did you know I used to work DCU?

484
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,400
- I give a fuck.
- Okay.

485
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
So, I still know some of those guys
real well.

486
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,300
Anyway, I heard someone
ripped Cheese off

487
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
on a New Hampshire run.

488
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,400
- Did you hear anything about that?
No.

489
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,000
- Care to take a polygraph?
- I already took one.

490
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,500
Different questions this time.

491
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,700
Come on. It's all right.

492
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,600
We don't care about a
couple of hopheads beating each other.

493
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
We care about your child.

494
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,000
So come on.

495
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,500
How much?

496
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,700
You even give a fuck about your kid?

497
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,300
'Course I do.

498
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,700
And we know you took the money.
So just tell us how much you took.

499
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,100
How much?

500
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,700
How much?

501
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,800
How much?

502
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,400
One thirty.

503
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,200
- $ 130,000?
- Yes, Bea.

504
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,000
How'd you do it?

505
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,300
Me and Ray had to do this
run up Nashua, right?

506
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,800
Yeah.

507
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,500
We dropped four ki's on these bikers.

508
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,200
When we was walking back
through the motel with all the money,

509
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,500
these cops just swooped right in,
went right for the bikers,

510
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,600
and Amanda was with us,
so we just pretended to be like a family.

511
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,800
- And we got in the car, took off.
- You took Amanda with you?

512
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,100
Oh, what am I gonna do?
Leave her in the car, Bea?

513
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,000
I don't got no daycare.

514
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,600
It's really hard being a mother.
It's hard raising a family, you know?

515
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
All on my own.

516
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,400
But God made you barren,
so you wouldn't fucking know.

517
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,500
- So I understand, Bea, okay?
- You are an abomination.

518
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,100
- Hey, hey, hey. Right here.
As God is my witness.

519
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,300
Right here. What happened next?

520
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:05,200
We was driving back,
and Ray, fucking Ray was like,

521
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,200
"You know everyone's gonna think
the cops got the money."

522
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,200
You told Cheese the cops got it.

523
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,200
But you and Ray
kept the money.

524
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,100
- This whole fucking thing is Ray's fault.
- Where's the money now, Helene?

525
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,300
- It's with Ray.
- And where's Ray?

526
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,900
- Chelsea.
- Let's go. Come on.

527
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,600
She rides with you.
I don't want her in my car.

528
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,800
- Go on. Move your bike!
- Go fuck your mother.

529
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,500
- What the...
- Beat it, sucker!

530
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,700
Helene, you used to go
with Scott Flaherty, didn't you?

531
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,300
- How do you know?
- You know, I went to Saint Mark's.

532
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,300
I was a freshman when you were
a senior. You don't remember me?

533
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,500
No.

534
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,900
Whatever happened to Scott?

535
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,100
He stabbed a foreign exchange student
in the chest.

536
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,400
He got life in Walpole.
He's a faggot now.

537
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,600
He was kind of a faggot in high school.

538
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Oh, man.
You're terrible. He was cute.

539
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,400
Well, he kind of wore them tight shorts.

540
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,900
Oh, who's a faggot now?
You're dating a faggot.

541
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,400
So, how did the...
How'd the money end up in Chelsea?

542
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,900
I thought youse and...
You and Ray went home after.

543
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,800
No, we dropped off Amanda
and went back to Ray's.

544
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,900
But fucking retarded Ray
left his baby rock at my place.

545
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,900
You know, right then, I'm like,
"I'm gonna drop this motherfucker.

546
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,600
"I don't care if he does got a big dick."

547
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,300
So we went back to the apartment
and Ray was hollering,

548
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,400
he was gonna wake up Amanda,
she needs her sleep, you know?

549
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,300
So, we went back to Ray's,

550
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,300
- or Ray's mother's. Whatever.
- Yeah?

551
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,800
I don't know where that mother went,
but she left all her fucking cats in there,

552
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
and it smells like cock.

553
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,500
And Cheese never contacted you,
never left you a note?

554
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,300
No.
We didn't hear nothing from Cheese.

555
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,100
That's why Ray said, "Don't say shit."

556
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,000
You didn't think it was worth it
for your daughter's sake

557
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,500
to tell people what happened?
Cheese has your kid.

558
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,400
God fucking knows
what he's doing to her.

559
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,700
What am I gonna do?

560
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,300
Call Cheese and be like,
"You got my daughter?

561
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,000
"'Cause I just ripped you off,
and I'm just checking."

562
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
Yeah!

563
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
- Helene, sit back.
- Oh, my God!

564
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,500
Oh, I'm gonna call the cops, too,
and be like, "You know,

565
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,800
"just so you know, wanna know
I run coke and heroin

566
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,200
"in case that's irrelevant."

567
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,500
All right, calm down.
Calm down.

568
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,900
You make me sick.

569
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,800
What makes you think Ray hasn't
spent all the money, Helene?

570
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,100
Nigger, please. I hid it.

571
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,400
Pull over.

572
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,000
Looks like somebody had a little talk
with Ray before they shot him.

573
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,400
- Looks like he held out pretty good.
- He didn't have it.

574
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,300
He couldn't tell them where the money
was, because he didn't know.

575
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,900
Helene hid it.

576
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,000
Ray made poor relationship choices.

577
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,400
Guess they didn't believe him.

578
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,900
Poor prick.

579
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,400
I'm not waiting
in a fucking car.

580
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,500
- Where's the money, Helene?
- I give a fuck about the money.

581
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,800
- Helene...
- I just want my daughter home with me.

582
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,300
I know it. I know, I'm... I'm sorry.
It's very upsetting about Ray. But...

583
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,200
- Where's the money?
- It's right there.

584
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,600
- Where?
- Buried it when Ray was passed out.

585
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
What was that book about,

586
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Everything You Need
Is in Your Own Backyard?

587
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,000
- I think it was a French book.
- Yeah, that wasn't a book.

588
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,200
- That was a book.
- No, it was a cartoon.

589
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,800
- The fuck out of here.
- No, it was a cartoon.

590
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,000
- Right, Helene?
- Fuck youse both.

591
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,300
Should we bring in the FBI
at this point?

592
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,600
- That's the worst thing we could do.
- Why is that?

593
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,500
'Cause I don't wanna see Cheese
kill Amanda

594
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,900
after he opens a bag
full of newspapers.

595
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,400
It's kidnapping.

596
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,100
- I don't see a note. You see a note?
- Nope. No note.

597
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,400
We're investigating
a missing children's case, here.

598
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,900
Kidnapping has nothing to do with it.
Fastest way to get Amanda home

599
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
is go to Cheese,
swap the money for her and walk away.

600
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,500
- Plain and simple.
- Do you know Cheese?

601
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,000
Knew his brother better, Jude.
He was a sweet kid.

602
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Cheese went another way.

603
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,500
- He wouldn't hurt her, right?
Ask Ray.

604
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,400
All right, listen.
All he cares about is his money.

605
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,800
If he gets it back...
He's not gonna hurt Amanda.

606
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,400
Just keep your mouth shut, okay?
We'll get her back. It'll be fine.

607
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,800
- Oh, you're gonna talk to him?
- Yeah, that's the idea.

608
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay. Well, tell him I'm sorry, all right?

609
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,800
I mean, he knows me,
just tell him I apologize.

610
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,700
Yeah, I'm sure that'll fix everything.
Just take her home.

611
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,900
- We'll take care of this, all right?
- We'll meet you over there.

612
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,300
I'm hungry.

613
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,700
All right. I'll get you something, Helene.

614
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,400
No, her.

615
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
That's what she said to me
right before I put her to bed.

616
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,000
She said, "I'm hungry."
I mean, they fed her, right?

617
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,200
She's not still hungry?

618
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,900
I don't know.

619
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,900
I know I fucked up.

620
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,300
I just want my daughter back.

621
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,100
I swear to God,
I won't use no drugs no more.

622
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,000
I won't even go out,
I'll be fucking straight.

623
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,700
Cross my heart.

624
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's all right.
We're gonna find her, Helene.

625
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,200
You have to. You promise?

626
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah. I'm gonna try. I will.

627
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,500
Promise. You have to promise me.

628
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,600
I promise.

629
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,700
All right.

630
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,000
Where do you
think you're going?

631
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,200
Talk to Cheese.

632
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,900
No, you're not.
No, get back in the car.

633
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,500
No, that's a mistake.
He's never gonna talk to a badge.

634
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,000
No. No way.
It's too important.

635
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,600
You wanna get the girl back, or not?

636
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,800
I know him.
If there's a deal to be brokered,

637
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,900
- we're the ones who can do it.
- No, me and Nick are handling this.

638
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Get back in the car.

639
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,800
Guys, you two go in there
and negotiate a ransom for a little girl,

640
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,300
then it is the FBI.
'Cause it's kidnapping.

641
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,500
All you're gonna do
is scare him.

642
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,300
The more you scare him,
the worse it is for her.

643
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,900
All right. Go ahead.

644
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,600
Just fucking relax, sit tight. I know him.
I'm gonna take care of it.

645
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,200
Good luck.

646
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,300
It's been a long time.

647
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,600
No. I quit.

648
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,100
I'm gonna talk some private shit.

649
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,200
- Don't wait, but don't get too far.
- You know I'll be right here.

650
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,600
Bitches love the cheddar.

651
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,600
- How you been, Chris?
- Better than you.

652
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
Yeah. Good to hear it.

653
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,300
- Fuck you.
- Man, be cool.

654
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,300
It's been too long not to see a fool.

655
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,300
I grant you audience.

656
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Go.

657
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,100
We found what you
were looking for in Chelsea.

658
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,300
What I care about Chelsea?

659
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,600
'Cause one of the idiots
that robbed you lived there.

660
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
What idiot?

661
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,700
The one that you and Chris
beat with a pipe and shot in the chest.

662
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,900
I don't know about nobody getting kill.

663
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,600
But if somebody rob me
and end up dead...

664
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,800
Well, you know, life is a motherfucker.

665
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,500
Cheese, we got your money.
It was buried in Ray's backyard.

666
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,500
We wanna give it back to you
in exchange for Amanda McCready.

667
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,900
The two police outside
are the only other people who know.

668
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,400
No one gives a fuck
about what you did.

669
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,600
I mean, I didn't even
like Ray that much.

670
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,500
You're gonna get your money,
the mother gets her daughter back,

671
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
and we'll say we found the kid
in the bushes, or whatever.

672
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,700
It's either this, real quiet,

673
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,000
or it's a thousand fucking cops
kicking your door in,

674
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,500
putting their fat knees in your neck.

675
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,300
Hold up.

676
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,700
Whoa. Whoa.

677
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,600
What the fuck is this?

678
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,500
Lift up your shirt.

679
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,400
- Come on, man.
- Motherfucker, you heard me.

680
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,900
Lift up your shirt.

681
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,500
- It ain't like that, Cheese.
- My CC, I ain't down with you.

682
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,500
Lift up your shirt.

683
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,400
You, too, baby.
Ain't no gender immunity.

684
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,900
Let me see some tit.

685
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,900
Don't ever come in my spot like that.

686
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,800
You got my money,

687
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,700
you leave that shit in the mailbox
on your ass way out, you feel me?

688
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,700
Some other motherfuckers
let fool rob on them.

689
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,000
I don't play scrimmage.

690
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,300
But I don't fuck with no kids.

691
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:18,100
And if that girl only hope is you,
well, I pray for her,

692
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,000
'cause she's gone, baby.

693
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,300
Gone.

694
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,800
Cheese, if you ever
disrespect her again like that,

695
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,400
I'm gonna pull your fucking card.

696
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,600
Okay?

697
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,100
So you're saying you didn't do it, fine.

698
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,300
We'll take your money,
and we'll be on our way.

699
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
But if it turns out you're lying,

700
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm going to spend every nickel
of that money to fuck you up.

701
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,800
I'm gonna bribe cops to go after you,

702
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,300
I'm gonna pay guys
to go after your weak fucking crew,

703
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,500
and I'm gonna tell everyone I know
that you're a CI and a rat.

704
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,600
And I know a lot of people.

705
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,400
And after that, you're gonna wish
you had listened to me,

706
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,200
'cause your shitty, pool-hall,
crime-syndicate headquarters

707
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,700
is gonna get raided.

708
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,300
And your doped-up bitches
are gonna get sent back to Laos,

709
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,800
and this fucking retard right here
is gonna be testifying against you

710
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,300
for a reduced sentence while you're
getting cornholed in your cell

711
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,000
by a gang of crackers.

712
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,100
'Cause from what I heard,

713
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,500
you guys that get sent up Concord
for killing kids,

714
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,400
life a motherfucker.

715
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,200
If I see you again,
I'm gonna get discourteous on you.

716
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,700
And get that sausage off my lawn.

717
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,300
Well, what happened?
- He said he didn't know anything,

718
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,200
but if you had his money,
you could put it in his mailbox.

719
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,100
- That's what he told you?
- That's it.

720
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,200
Nothing else?

721
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,600
Yeah. He said that he wanted
you two off his lawn.

722
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,900
I thought you said
you knew this fucking guy.

723
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,200
Half the guys he knows
are degenerates.

724
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,900
Yeah, you know
what the other half are?

725
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
- What?
- Cops. Don't hold it against me.

726
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,000
No, no. I won't hold it against you.

727
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,900
You know what I'll hold against you?

728
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,500
We had one chance to make this deal.
You said you knew him.

729
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,500
You said you could do it
and you fucked it up.

730
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,600
Now I gotta get a warrant for a tap,
start surveillance,

731
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,500
hope to Christ we get lucky.

732
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,700
You know, if Amanda
dies because of this,

733
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,600
I won't have to hold it against you.

734
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:58,300
You'll hold it against yourself
for a long, long time.

735
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,100
Hope we didn't fuck this up.

736
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,800
- Yeah.
- Cheese called in.

737
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,700
Says he'll take the deal with Amanda,
but he wants to go tonight.

738
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,400
- Great.
- Well, it is and it isn't.

739
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,200
They record calls at the station now.

740
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,800
- Jack got a hold of the transcript.
- What does that mean?

741
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,000
It means our badges are
basically fucking forfeit at this point.

742
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,900
He wants you both down here, now.

743
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,100
Oh, and, hey, Cheese said
he left something in a mailbox

744
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,500
to prove that he's got Amanda.

745
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,100
This is a transcript of a recorded call
that came in this morning.

746
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,400
Care to read the highlighted portion?

747
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,900
Aloud?

748
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,300
Uh.

749
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,900
"Caller: Bitch,
you better have my money.

750
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,000
"Detective Bressant: Who is this?

751
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,600
"The caller:
You know who the fuck this is, fool...

752
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,200
"Creole curse words.
If you want that girl back,

753
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,700
"you need to meet me up
Quincy tonight.

754
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,300
"Fuck around for a minute
and I'll throw that girl in the lake."

755
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,000
The lake he refers to is the water
in the abandoned quarry.

756
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,700
Detective Bressant goes on to make
an unauthorized ransom arrangement

757
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,500
to exchange Amanda McCready
for $ 130,000 tonight

758
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,600
in just that location.

759
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,200
After some discussion,
Detective Bressant was kind enough

760
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,000
to produce this.

761
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,200
Recognize it?

762
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,400
The four of you have involved me
in an illegal activity

763
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,000
without my knowledge or consent,
and I don't fucking appreciate it.

764
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,500
- You don't have to be a part of it, sir.
- The hell I don't.

765
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,300
If I delay this now, after this agreement,

766
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,100
I just further endanger
the life of that child.

767
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,000
Does that sound like something
you expect me to do?

768
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,400
No, sir.

769
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,900
I went in there. I'll accept responsibility.

770
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,900
You'll accept nothing!

771
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,700
Don't come in here
trying to get noble, boy.

772
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,700
Let me see that note.

773
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,000
My God.

774
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,200
He wants to separate us.

775
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,000
The note instructs you guys to be
on the east side and wait for Amanda,

776
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:12,400
me and Nick to be at the clearing
by the edge with the money.

777
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,300
Once Amanda's turned over to you,
you give us a call on the radio,

778
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,200
we turn over the cash.

779
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,400
- Who's he likely to bring with him?
- Chris Mullen.

780
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,600
He was at the club
when we made the offer.

781
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,300
What do you know about him?

782
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,300
It was probably him
who killed Ray for Cheese.

783
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,600
If I had to guess.

784
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,400
All right.
Nobody else knows about this, right?

785
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,900
- I don't know.
- Yes?

786
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,100
I'm asking if keeping it quiet is better
for Amanda or is it better for us?

787
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,500
Do you have any children,
Miss Gennaro?

788
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,100
No, sir.

789
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,100
My only child was murdered.
She was 12. Did you hear about it?

790
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,100
What you probably didn't hear,

791
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,400
and what I hope
you never have to deal with,

792
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,000
Miss Gennaro, is what that feels like.
What I have to deal with.

793
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,600
Knowing that my little girl likely died

794
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,300
crying out for me
to come and save her.

795
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,800
And I never did.

796
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:15,800
My little girl died afraid and alone
in a shallow ditch bank

797
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,500
by the side of the road
not 10 minutes from my house.

798
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,700
I know what it feels like to lose a child.

799
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,500
Now, damn it, you force my hand

800
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,900
and then you question
the way I handle it.

801
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,200
No one's questioning you, sir.

802
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,000
I honor my child with this division.

803
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,100
So that no parent
has to go through what I've known.

804
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,000
This child.

805
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,800
That's all I care about.

806
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,700
I'm gonna bring her home.

807
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,200
Why'd he bring us all the way up here?

808
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,900
I don't know. It's big. It's dark.
It's easy to get away.

809
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,100
No.

810
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,700
They're gonna kill her.

811
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,200
This asshole could've found
some level fucking ground somewhere.

812
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:54,300
This is where we part ways.
You guys'll be on top of that cliff.

813
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
We'll be right across from you.

814
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,600
Give us a call on the radio
when you have her.

815
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,100
- We will.
- Well, good luck.

816
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,400
Let's go.

817
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,000
How are they gonna
get Amanda up here?

818
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,200
Ambush! Ambush!

819
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,200
Hey, Remy! Fucking Cheese!
Where is she?

820
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,200
There she is.
I can see her. It ain't the way it is!

821
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,900
Someone hit Cheese!

822
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,000
You sure you heard something?
Yes!

823
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,600
- Over there!
What happened?

824
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,400
I don't know. I heard a splash.
Down there!

825
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,500
Somebody took Cheese out,

826
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,000
- and then all hell broke loose.
Where's Amanda?

827
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,200
- Shots were fired from over there.
I don't know!

828
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,300
Something went in the water!

829
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,400
- What?
- You sure you heard something?

830
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,800
- Yeah, something went in, but I...
- Where did it go?

831
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,300
There! Right there!

832
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,400
Oh, my God.

833
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,900
Oh, no.

834
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,900
Jesus Christ!

835
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,000
Paging
Dr. Goldsburn. Dr. Goldsburn to ICU.

836
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

837
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,600
- How's the leg?
- It'll be fine.

838
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,600
They find anything?

839
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:10,700
- They got divers in there now.
- She could still be alive.

840
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,600
Maybe she's hiding.
She could be stuck.

841
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,800
Right?

842
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
I don't think so.

843
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,900
Hey...

844
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,100
He's ever seen
in all his years,

845
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:48,100
on a little girl called Amanda
and a doll named Mirabelle.

846
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,200
This quarry is
extremely deep and treacherous.

847
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,400
All too often,
she keeps that which she takes in.

848
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,200
A sad end
to that story, Suzanne.

849
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,800
It sure is, Phil.

850
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,400
And Ron is next with
sports. The Bruins in action tonight?

851
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,900
Yes, they are, Phil.

852
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,800
The B's took a crack
at the Flyers tonight,

853
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,000
and the rough stuff started
in the first period.

854
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,700
And like that, she was gone.

855
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,000
We gave our statements.
Nick and Remy the same.

856
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,900
All of us spared any blame
for Amanda's death.

857
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,900
Jack Doyle resigned on the condition

858
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,100
that he and he alone
be held accountable.

859
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,900
The legendary captain
of a unit dedicated to children

860
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,600
stepped down today
in the aftermath of controversy.

861
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,700
He was granted
the dignity of early retirement.

862
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,700
But the humiliation of half a pension.

863
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,300
It was an ignominious end
to an illustrious career.

864
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,400
Chris' run lasted a day and a half until,
from what they could tell,

865
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,500
he ran into someone who wanted
the money more than he did.

866
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,500
Twenty-nine-year-old
Chris Mullen

867
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,700
was gunned down last night

868
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,300
in an apparent robbery.

869
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,600
The police commissioner
defended the rising tide of crime

870
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,600
as a statistical aberration tied
to growing unemployment

871
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,600
and the humidity of...

872
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,600
Enough time went by
and they called off the search.

873
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,300
They issued Helene
a death certificate.

874
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,400
The frame and the casket were
donated by the funeral home,

875
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,100
but had to be returned
at the end of the afternoon.

876
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,500
You know I love you, right?

877
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,000
Yeah.

878
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,000
I just wanna be alone for a while.

879
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,300
I don't know if she blamed
me or if she blamed herself.

880
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,800
But when she didn't think I was home,

881
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,300
or if she thought I couldn't hear,

882
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,100
she would cry.

883
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,800
I couldn't stop running it over
and over and over in my mind,

884
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,400
the vague and distant suspicion

885
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,500
that we never understood
what happened that night,

886
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,300
what our role was.

887
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,500
Or maybe it was just that,
like the hundreds of other children

888
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,400
who disappear each year
and never return...

889
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,000
Amanda was even more haunting
for never being found.

890
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,000
What they did find
was another big story,

891
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,400
and I couldn't help but find it strange.

892
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:09,500
Not two months later and not far away,
another child went missing.

893
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,200
...and community watch patrols
are being formed.

894
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,300
A bicycle left
roadside. A tire left spinning.

895
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,200
Late-breaking news
on that story.

896
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,600
Little Johnny Pietro is also wearing

897
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,800
what this reporter believes
might be a sign.

898
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,800
Johnny Pietro was wearing the
medallion of St. Christopher,

899
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,000
patron saint of...

900
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,200
Johnny Pietro
and his medallion.

901
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,900
What I didn't find strange
was this time,

902
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,400
no relatives came knocking
on our door.

903
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,700
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hi.

904
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,200
- I need you to come on a ride with me.
- Where?

905
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,500
To Everett.

906
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,800
- What, no parties in Lynn?
- Funny.

907
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,100
- You got your toast with you, right?
- My what?

908
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,900
Your gun, dummy.

909
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,000
Yeah.

910
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,800
This ain't no
strip-clubbing in Lynn, Patrick.

911
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,000
I got something better for you, buddy.

912
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
You asked me to find
some people for you.

913
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,500
I think I found them.

914
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,600
What you getting me into?

915
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,700
You don't give a fuck about this
Corwin Earle dude no more?

916
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,100
Yo, 'cause the fat bitch
and the old dude are in there.

917
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:40,100
My man didn't know about the diddler.

918
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,800
Come in with me. Watch my side.

919
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,000
We'll find out
if this motherfucker's in there.

920
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,800
You know what, Patrick?

921
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,500
If you don't wanna come in,
you don't have to come in.

922
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,100
If you don't wanna come in, fuck it.

923
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,400
Let's go.

924
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,500
Guess who?

925
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,400
- Jerome Miller?
- No, it's the coke fairy.

926
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,300
- Open up.
- I got the money right here.

927
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,600
Marmaduke, you think you're gonna
hand me money on a fucking porch?

928
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,500
Open the door.

929
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,000
Who's he?

930
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,800
He's your father.
Open the fucking door!

931
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,000
- Look out.
- Okay, man!

932
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,900
Chill! Chill!

933
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,400
What are you guys, starting a band?

934
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,600
No one's starting a band.

935
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,300
It's a taste.

936
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,600
Cocaine for the old man.

937
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,100
Fucking Christ.

938
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,500
Want me to change
a roll of quarters for you, too?

939
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,400
I told you to tell me when they got here!

940
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,100
They just got here.

941
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,200
- You already did some!
- It was a taste bag.

942
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,500
Sorry, love.

943
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,800
Here, count this fucking mess.

944
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,100
Where's the rest, man?

945
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,300
As soon as he's finished counting
that fucking mess you gave me.

946
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,200
- Mr. Miller, do you mind?
- No, I don't mind.

947
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,000
- Excuse me!
- You're excused.

948
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,100
- Hey, please don't snoop around, sir.
Hey, relax, handsome.

949
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,400
Excuse me!

950
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,000
Where the fuck you think you're going?

951
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,300
Mr. Miller, I'm warning you!

952
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,900
Stop!

953
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,000
Patrick, shoot this bitch.

954
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,500
You fat busted cunt.

955
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,600
You put a gun on me, you better use it.

956
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,200
Just give us the fucking wizza!

957
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,200
You don't wanna shoot her, Patrick?

958
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,200
Who's this guy?

959
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,900
Corwin!
Go back to your room!

960
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,900
It's not a party?

961
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,000
No, it's not a party.

962
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,300
How much money's there, Patrick?

963
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,900
Enough.

964
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,800
Want this?

965
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,300
What are you doing?
Pick up the fucking money.

966
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,700
At least two guns in
the house. Roberta's carrying hers.

967
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,000
What else?
- Well, they're definitely high.

968
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,100
- On what?
- Cocaine.

969
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,100
Your friend tell you that, too?

970
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,600
SWAT'll be here in five minutes.

971
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,900
You're not gonna wait for them?

972
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,100
Did you or did you not tell me
you saw Corwin Earle

973
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,000
with the medallion of St. Christopher
around his fucking wrist?

974
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,400
I definitely saw Corwin Earle.

975
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,600
We're not waiting.

976
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,300
Stay here.
And don't fuck around, all right?

977
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,700
Good job.

978
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,200
Fuck.

979
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,600
An... An officer... Shots are fired!
An officer down... Shots...

980
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,700
Listen to me!

981
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,300
A police officer has been shot
at 33 German Road!

982
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,000
Get away from him!

983
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,600
It was an accident.

984
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,400
It was an accident.

985
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,700
Wait!

986
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,500
Hey.

987
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,400
You okay?

988
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,200
They told me what happened.

989
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,700
I'm proud of you.

990
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,600
That man killed a child.

991
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,200
He had no right to live.

992
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,500
- You're proud of me?
- Of course I am.

993
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,000
You did what you had to do.

994
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,800
Let's go home.

995
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,000
I gotta stay here awhile.

996
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,800
- See you at home.
- Yeah.

997
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,600
Thanks.

998
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,500
It was fucked up, right?

999
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,300
They tell you anything about Nick?

1000
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,900
They said he could be okay.

1001
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,100
I don't know.

1002
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:18,000
They say how old that little boy was?

1003
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,600
Seven.

1004
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,900
Second grade.

1005
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:30,100
Should be proud of yourself.
Most guys would've stayed outside.

1006
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,500
I don't know.

1007
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,500
What don't you know?

1008
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:40,600
My priest says shame is God
telling you what you did was wrong.

1009
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,400
Fuck him.

1010
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,000
Murder's a sin.

1011
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,600
Depends on who you do it to.

1012
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:54,200
That's not how it works. It is what it is.

1013
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,100
I planted evidence on a guy once,

1014
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,300
back in '95.

1015
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,800
We were paying $ 100
an eight-ball to snitches.

1016
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,600
We got a call
from our pal, Ray Likanski.

1017
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,900
He couldn't find enough guys to rat out.

1018
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,100
Anyway, he tells us there's a guy
pumping up in an apartment

1019
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,300
up in Columbia Point.

1020
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,200
We go in, me and Nicky.

1021
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:33,600
Fifteen years ago, when Nicky went in,
it was no joke.

1022
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,700
So, it's a... It's a stash house, right?

1023
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:39,700
The old lady's beat to shit,
the husband's mean, cracked out,

1024
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,400
tries to give us trouble,
Nicky lays him down.

1025
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,500
We're doing an inventory,
but it looks like we messed up

1026
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,900
because there's no dope in the house,
and I go in the back room...

1027
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,500
Now, this place
was a shithole, mind you.

1028
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,200
Rats, roaches all over the place.

1029
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,500
But the kid's room, in the back,

1030
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,400
was spotless.

1031
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,500
No, I mean, he swept it, mopped it,
it was immaculate.

1032
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,400
The little boy's sitting on the bed

1033
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,900
holding onto his PlayStation
for dear life.

1034
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,500
There's no expression on his face,

1035
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,300
tears streaming down.

1036
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,500
He wants to tell me he just learned
his multiplication tables.

1037
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,800
Christ.

1038
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,400
I mean, the father's got him
in this crack den,

1039
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,200
subsisting on Twinkies
and ass-whippings,

1040
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:37,900
and this little boy just wants someone
to tell him that he's doing a good job.

1041
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,400
You're worried what's Catholic?

1042
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,600
I mean, kids forgive.

1043
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,800
Kids don't judge.

1044
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,200
Kids turn the other cheek.

1045
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,200
What do they get for it?

1046
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,500
So I went back out there,

1047
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,600
I put an ounce of heroin
on the living room floor,

1048
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:02,100
and I sent the father on a ride,
seven to nine.

1049
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,300
- That was the right thing?
- Fucking A!

1050
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,700
You gotta take a side.

1051
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:18,700
You molest a child, you beat a child,

1052
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,500
you're not on my side.

1053
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,100
If you see me coming, you better run,

1054
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,000
because I am gonna
lay you the fuck down!

1055
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,100
Easy.

1056
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,600
Don't feel easy.

1057
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,500
Is the kid better off without his father?

1058
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,500
Yeah.

1059
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,400
But okay, I mean,
could be out there right now,

1060
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,000
pumping with a gun in his waistband.

1061
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,600
It's a war, man.

1062
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,700
Are we winning?

1063
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,800
No.

1064
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:08,100
Would you do it again?
Clip Corwin Earle?

1065
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,100
No.

1066
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,700
Does that make you right?

1067
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,300
Hmm?

1068
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,700
I don't know.

1069
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,200
Doesn't make it wrong, though,
does it?

1070
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,800
- Hey.
- Hi.

1071
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,600
How's Remy?

1072
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,900
He lied to me.

1073
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,100
What did Remy say about Ray
back in Roxbury?

1074
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,000
- Never heard of him.
- Never heard of him.

1075
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,100
Now he says Ray's been snitching
for him for 15 years.

1076
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,400
He called him his "old pal."

1077
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,400
Said he couldn't find
enough people to snitch out.

1078
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,700
Patrick...

1079
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,700
And Ray Likanski is the reason
Amanda got taken in the first place,

1080
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,000
and Remy lies about knowing him.

1081
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,500
Let it go.

1082
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,100
Why would he lie?
What's he have to hide?

1083
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,200
Amanda's dead.

1084
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,400
Let it go.

1085
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,800
Babe.

1086
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,900
Nick died.

1087
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,600
Left. Left.

1088
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,600
Mr. Kenzie.

1089
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,900
Nice fucking job on Corwin Earle.

1090
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:18,800
Amen.

1091
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,300
- Sorry about Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1092
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:03,000
I was thinking about our conversation
the other night.

1093
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,200
Well, I said some things
I shouldn't have.

1094
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,900
You know, too much rum.

1095
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,600
Yeah, like what?

1096
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,100
Don't fuck with me, Patrick. Not today.

1097
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,600
Oh, I wouldn't fuck with you.

1098
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,600
Oh, you wanna play it like that, huh?
Okay.

1099
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,500
Forget about the other night,
and we'll be friends.

1100
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,300
What if I don't?

1101
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:34,800
That's not an "if"
you wanna bring into your life.

1102
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,400
Had lunch with him last week.

1103
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,600
Dana had lunch with him last week?

1104
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,100
Excuse me.

1105
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,900
Hey, Dev.

1106
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,900
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right, how you been?

1107
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,000
I can't complain.

1108
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,600
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

1109
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,400
Not here.

1110
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,900
If it's like that, then
you're gonna have to buy me lunch.

1111
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,700
- How's the Chart House, half hour?
- Sounds about right.

1112
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,500
Hey, Remy used to work Narcotics
with you, right?

1113
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,300
DCU, yeah. What's up?

1114
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,900
Why'd he leave?

1115
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:14,500
Had a habit of just
rubbing people the wrong way.

1116
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,600
Like what? What'd he do?

1117
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:19,200
Like marry a prostitute, for one.

1118
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,300
Come on.

1119
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,100
Might not wanna do that
if you're a cop, right?

1120
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,800
Might not wanna do that
if you're a plumber.

1121
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,700
So, what happened?

1122
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:30,400
He says he loves her,
tells Mike Snell to go fuck himself,

1123
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,600
and puts in for a transfer.

1124
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:32,700
What, to Doyle?

1125
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,500
Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana, back in '72.

1126
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:40,000
You don't think that Remy's
dirty, though, do you?

1127
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,900
What's "dirty"?

1128
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,800
- I know he planted evidence once.
- Oh, you do?

1129
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,300
Yeah. Why?

1130
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,900
Look, man. CSI is killing us out here.

1131
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,500
Every other juror, all they wanna know
is where the microfibers are.

1132
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,400
Certain people are workers.

1133
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,100
Don't wanna plant it,
but you know how it is.

1134
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,400
So they don't mind it.

1135
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,000
So tell me something,
what you fucking with him for?

1136
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,900
He lied to me.

1137
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,300
I can't think of one reason
big enough for him to lie

1138
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:17,000
that's small enough not to matter.

1139
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,600
All right, look.

1140
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:28,100
I know one thing, but it's third party,
so you gotta play it like that.

1141
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,200
Helene and Ray took Cheese's money
back in June, right?

1142
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,300
Yeah.

1143
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,400
One week later,
Remy goes to a cop in DCU

1144
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,900
asking if anybody knew
who robbed Cheese.

1145
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,200
So what?

1146
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,000
So my informant tells me,

1147
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,600
Cheese didn't even know
he got robbed until two weeks later.

1148
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,800
So Remy knew Cheese got robbed
before Cheese did?

1149
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,700
How'd he know that?

1150
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,700
Let me tell you something.

1151
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:53,800
You better think long and hard

1152
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:56,900
before you start running around here
investigating the police.

1153
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,800
You try and take food out their mouths,
and they will fuck you up.

1154
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,300
Thanks for the steak.

1155
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,700
All right.

1156
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,500
Hey.

1157
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,100
I got it.

1158
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,600
We need to talk to you, Lionel.

1159
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,100
About what?

1160
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,900
About the acoustics in your apartment.

1161
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,600
What?

1162
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:37,600
Oh, we live
in a three-decker, too, Lionel.

1163
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,500
I got nothing to talk about.

1164
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,700
Well, that's fine.
We can talk to the state police.

1165
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,900
Meet me at Murphy's Law.

1166
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,900
I don't meet him
down Murphy's,

1167
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,200
he's gonna call the staties.

1168
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,700
He's putting a
move on you. Don't go down there.

1169
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,800
I can handle Patrick Kenzie.

1170
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,600
- This is an oath we took.
- I started this.

1171
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,700
- This has to be protected.
- I got things to protect, too.

1172
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:16,800
- Listen to me!
- All right, Remy.

1173
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:19,300
You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me.

1174
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,700
- Just trust me, all right?
- No! Trust me!

1175
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:26,400
Where I come from,
you die with your secrets!

1176
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,100
How long have you known Remy?

1177
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,300
Detective Bressant? Just in...

1178
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,600
Met him through
the investigation of Amanda.

1179
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,600
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1180
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,200
How long you known Remy?

1181
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,400
What is this?

1182
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,500
They got the Internet, now, Lionel.

1183
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,900
You know how it is in town.
Everybody knows everybody.

1184
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,500
No. Everybody don't know everybody.

1185
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,100
- What're you talking about?
- Why you lying?

1186
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,200
I'm not.

1187
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:25,100
You bragged about taking a hard bust
on the first day we met you.

1188
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:26,700
- No, I didn't.
- Bullshit.

1189
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,300
You're hiding something, Lionel,
and you better fucking tell it,

1190
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:32,300
'cause you came to our house
and you asked us for help.

1191
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,600
And we killed ourselves
trying to save Amanda.

1192
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,500
And I know you ain't being 100%
with me right now,

1193
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,500
and it's really fucking pissing me off
that you're lying,

1194
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,000
so you better interrupt me at any time,
'cause I'm about to lose...

1195
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,000
Okay. Fine, fine. All right?
Don't have a heart attack.

1196
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,300
I haven't been honest with you.

1197
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,300
It's just not something I'm proud of.
You know?

1198
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,300
I got in a bar fight back in the day.

1199
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:54,600
The other guy cracked his skull.

1200
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,100
At some point,
I must've said, "I'll kill you."

1201
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:01,600
So they had me up for attempted.
It's my word against this other guy's.

1202
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,400
Witness testified to my version
and the jury believed him.

1203
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,400
- 'Cause he was a cop.
- Yeah, he testified for me.

1204
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,100
So you knew Detective Bressant.

1205
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,500
- It's not like we were best friends.
- But you lied.

1206
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:14,800
- Why did you call Remy?
- He's a cop.

1207
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,700
- That's not why you called him, Lionel.
- Come on.

1208
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,600
It's a small place.
You heard them arguing.

1209
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:20,300
- They were being loud.
- Who? Who... Who...

1210
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,800
So you called Remy, and you and him
took Amanda to blackmail your sister.

1211
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,600
Why would I do that?

1212
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,700
I don't know, Lionel. I really don't know.

1213
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,800
Maybe because after all the
"I put the fucking plug in the jug,"

1214
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,800
and the "count your blessings"
and the "watch your language,"

1215
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:40,100
you're just like everybody else.

1216
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,000
You saw a bag of money
and you wanted it.

1217
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,700
And you thought
you could get away with it.

1218
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,900
But Bea called the media
and made a big thing of it.

1219
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,300
And then she called us,
and then you were fucked.

1220
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,500
The case is closed, Patrick.
The case is closed.

1221
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,900
Coke-dealing Haitian's
a pretty easy target for a frame.

1222
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,300
- Lionel?
- Excuse me.

1223
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,400
- Look at me.
- Okay. Excuse me.

1224
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,100
You took your niece,
and you laid it off on a black guy.

1225
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:58,400
- Pardon me.
- Lionel, tell me what happened.

1226
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,600
Can I get some service?

1227
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,100
Yeah.

1228
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,200
What?

1229
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:15,000
- Three shots of Cutty and a tallboy.
- Yeah.

1230
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,500
Thank you.

1231
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,900
Just give me a second.

1232
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:54,100
Twenty-three years
is something, right?

1233
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,100
Go.

1234
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,400
I come up to check on Amanda.
She was alone as usual.

1235
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:20,200
I was reading her a story
when Helene and Ray come home.

1236
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:21,400
They didn't know I was there.

1237
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:25,000
Stop fucking yelling,
my daughter's sleeping in there.

1238
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,700
They started talking about how
they'd robbed this drug dealer.

1239
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,900
You know what he's fucking gonna do
if he finds out?

1240
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,700
What's the monkey gonna do?

1241
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,100
- Oh, you know...
- I'm not...

1242
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,400
And they were talking
about leaving the state.

1243
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:39,900
So I called Remy and told him.

1244
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,700
There's another drug run
up to Nashua. Taking cocaine...

1245
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,400
And then what?

1246
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,300
We took her.

1247
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,900
Remy laid out this plan.
It seemed easy.

1248
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:57,800
We take her, force Helene and Ray
to cough up the cash,

1249
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,900
then we put her back. You know?

1250
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Amanda gets to spend
a weekend in the country.

1251
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,600
My sister learns a lesson.

1252
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,700
And fuck it, everybody gets paid
on top of it.

1253
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,800
I got no problem taking money
from a guy like Cheese.

1254
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,400
They were gonna handle the cops.

1255
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,700
But Bea, she went nuts.

1256
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,400
Started calling the papers. Hired you.

1257
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,800
Lionel don't want me coming here,
now you don't want the job?

1258
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,800
But once you found the money,
they had Amanda and the money.

1259
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:27,000
So they decided to set up
a fake exchange for you to witness.

1260
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:29,800
They got Chris Mullen
to set up Cheese at the quarry.

1261
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,400
15K and a chance to be the boss.

1262
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,500
Cheese figured out
what was happening.

1263
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,100
Even though it was too late,
he started shooting.

1264
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,100
Panicking.

1265
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,100
And she just fell. I mean, she just...

1266
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,800
She fell in.

1267
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:53,900
She's gone.

1268
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,200
It was an accident.
It was just an accident.

1269
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,400
She was your sister's kid, Lionel.

1270
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:04,000
- Your sister's child.
- You think I don't miss her?

1271
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,600
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1272
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:11,800
Last summer, Helene and Dottie
took Amanda to the beach.

1273
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,100
It was a real hot day.
Amanda fell asleep.

1274
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,100
They left her in the car
while they go off into the dunes,

1275
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,000
smoke a doobie with some guys.

1276
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,800
Two hours.

1277
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,200
Amanda literally roasted.

1278
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,000
She was three.

1279
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:37,000
Later on, I was holding her,
trying to help her get to sleep.

1280
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,700
My little Amanda, she was so hot.

1281
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,900
She felt like something
just come out of the oven.

1282
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,600
Like a fucking pot roast.

1283
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:56,000
So don't feel too sorry for my sister.

1284
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:59,900
Because she never gave a shit
about anyone but herself.

1285
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,800
Bartender. Open the safe. Now.

1286
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:10,400
Everybody needs to shut up and stay
calm. On the floor. On the floor!

1287
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,200
- Hands on your head. Do it.
Oh, my God.

1288
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,800
Everybody stays calm,
this'll be over in a minute.

1289
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:16,800
Hey, do you know
whose bar this is, shithead?

1290
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,300
Or you can get wise, it's up to you.

1291
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,800
What did you say?

1292
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,600
You're a talker, huh?

1293
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,200
Just keep revving, motherfucker.

1294
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,400
Don't antagonize him.
He's got a gun.

1295
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,800
- Oh, just keep yapping away.
- I didn't say nothing.

1296
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,800
You should learn
to keep your mouth shut.

1297
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,300
Shut the fuck up,
for Christ's sake.

1298
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:41,100
- Just keep talking, pal.
- I didn't say nothing.

1299
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:42,500
Close your eyes.

1300
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,700
- Fuck!
- Remy Bressant.

1301
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,100
Amanda McCready
was taken by Remy Bressant.

1302
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,900
Oh, fuck, God. Amanda McCready
was taken by Remy Bressant!

1303
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,800
- Wait. Wait. Jesus.
Remy Bressant.

1304
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,400
God damn it. Remy Bressant!

1305
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,600
Amanda McCready was taken

1306
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,800
- by Remy Bressant.
- Jesus. I told him.

1307
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,300
I told him we took her for ransom.
I told him. I told him, Remy.

1308
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,900
Please, I told him we took her
for ransom. I did it.

1309
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,800
Remy, please.

1310
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,500
Please.

1311
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,600
Are you all right?

1312
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:26,800
Stay with him.

1313
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,000
Drop your gun.

1314
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,400
Put it down!

1315
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:42,600
That bartender wasn't fucking around.

1316
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:53,800
What did you do?

1317
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,200
Did you get her killed?

1318
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,800
Say yes.

1319
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,100
Say yes.

1320
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,500
Say yes!

1321
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:14,600
What're you gonna do? Shoot me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1322
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:30,900
She was a child.

1323
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,000
I love children.

1324
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,400
Why would I expose a conspiracy
that I was a part of?

1325
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,300
I mean, did Lionel contradict
anything I've said?

1326
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,800
Did any of the witnesses at the bar
contradict anything I've said?

1327
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:28,600
A police officer was killed today.
That's not looked on lightly.

1328
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,800
Is corruption looked on lightly?

1329
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,600
Is a little girl getting killed
looked on lightly?

1330
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,900
Whoa, hold on.

1331
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:36,400
You charge people money
as a detective.

1332
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:40,400
Now, you're at the quarry
the other night, right?

1333
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,400
And you have no idea
that this is a setup?

1334
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,800
You're baffled. Right?

1335
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:51,800
No, because, strange as it might seem,

1336
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:55,200
I believe the police
when they tell me something.

1337
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,100
You're a fresh prick. You know that?

1338
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,400
And because I had a ransom note
and Amanda McCready's blanket

1339
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,600
put in my mailbox.

1340
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,700
And because I read a transcript of
a call that Cheese put into the station.

1341
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:04,800
A 911 call?

1342
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:08,000
No, it was a call
Cheese made to the station.

1343
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,300
To Remy Bressant at the station.

1344
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,500
Or that Chris Mullen made,
pretending to be Cheese.

1345
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,300
Or whatever the fuck it was,
but it was recorded,

1346
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,300
and there was a call.

1347
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:17,300
We don't record calls
coming into the station,

1348
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:20,200
and we don't do transcripts, smart guy.

1349
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,800
So, did you hear a tape?

1350
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,500
- No, I didn't hear a tape.
- Okay.

1351
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,800
Did you see a transcript?

1352
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,100
No, I must've remembered it wrong.

1353
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,800
Kids forgive.

1354
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,400
What do they get for it?

1355
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,900
Amanda literally roasted.

1356
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,400
You think I don't miss her.

1357
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,900
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1358
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,100
I love children.

1359
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,900
This is the kind of thing that if you do,
Patrick, you wanna be sure.

1360
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,900
Are you sure?

1361
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,000
No.

1362
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,700
Are you coming?

1363
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:31,600
No.

1364
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:46,000
Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana back in '72.

1365
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,800
Care to read
the highlighted portion?

1366
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,800
Taking a trip?

1367
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:04,600
Patrick Kenzie.

1368
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,000
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1369
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:11,700
Remy Bressant died last night.

1370
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:15,300
I was told. It's a shame.

1371
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:21,300
Yeah, it's hard to understand.
Because he seemed like a good man.

1372
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,200
He was a good man.

1373
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:27,200
We don't know
why people do what they do.

1374
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,900
Everybody looks out his own window.

1375
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:32,300
And everyone's got their reasons.

1376
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:44,400
- Hey.
- Hi.

1377
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,800
- How are you?
- Good.

1378
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,900
Nick! They're firing at me.

1379
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,700
Nick, you hear me? You okay?
They're firing at me!

1380
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,900
Remy!

1381
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,300
- I heard something go in the water!
- Ambush! Ambush!

1382
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:56,200
- Something went in!
- Run. Remy. Run!

1383
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,300
Panicking.

1384
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,200
Amanda got scared.
She started running.

1385
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:04,200
She just fell. I mean, she just fell in.

1386
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:09,800
Twenty-nine-year-old
Chris Mullen

1387
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,300
was gunned down last night

1388
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,600
in an apparent robbery.

1389
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:15,800
You go back inside with Frannie.
Papa will come in soon.

1390
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:17,100
Make you a sandwich, okay?

1391
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,400
- All right.
- That's my girl.

1392
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,500
Don't go down there.

1393
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,300
If I think he has the evidence,
I'll take the hit.

1394
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,500
I got no problem doing the time.

1395
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,000
Fuck up, and it's Amanda and her life.

1396
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,400
All right.
I got things to protect, too.

1397
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,700
You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me

1398
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,000
and you're a danger to Amanda.

1399
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,200
Please, I told him
we took her for ransom. I did it.

1400
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,300
I told him. Remy, please.

1401
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,700
So now you know.

1402
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,100
My sister's not stable.
She's on crack.

1403
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,200
She's talking about leaving the state.
I'm scared for my niece.

1404
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,500
- Who's gonna take care of her?
- We'll do something.

1405
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,700
We'll figure it out.
She's an addict.

1406
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,400
Bigot. Drug mule.

1407
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:55,500
The child will be dead
or on the street in 10 years.

1408
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:58,200
What about the uncle?
He can never tell anyone.

1409
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:01,700
Not even his wife.
Or he'll never see her again.

1410
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:05,800
It's worth it to him.
Know she'll have a better life.

1411
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,800
Do one last good thing
before we hang it up.

1412
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,700
How many children
have we seen destroyed?

1413
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:15,900
Enough.

1414
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,600
Does it make you feel better?

1415
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,800
Telling yourself you did it
for the right reasons?

1416
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,200
That you took her to be saved.

1417
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:28,100
From her own mother?

1418
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:33,500
We're just trying to give
a little girl a life.

1419
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:38,100
Wasn't your life to give.
Helene's her mother.

1420
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:40,900
If you thought she was a bad mother,
you should've gone to Social Services.

1421
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:44,900
Short of that, she's her mother,
and that's where she belongs.

1422
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,300
You turn around.

1423
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:52,600
You go back to your fucking car,
and you wait 30 years.

1424
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,500
You don't know
what the world is made of yet.

1425
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,900
I'm calling state police in five minutes.
They'll be here in ten.

1426
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,800
Thought you would've
done that by now.

1427
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:09,300
You know why you haven't?

1428
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:15,200
Because you think
this might be an irreparable mistake.

1429
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:19,900
Because deep inside you, you know
it doesn't matter what the rules say.

1430
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
When the lights go out
and you ask yourself,

1431
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:26,000
"Is she better off here or better off
there," you know the answer.

1432
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:28,100
And you always will.

1433
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:35,000
You... You could do a right thing here.

1434
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,800
A good thing.

1435
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Men live their whole lives
without getting this chance.

1436
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,900
You walk away from it,

1437
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,300
you may not regret it
when you get home.

1438
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,700
You may not regret it for a year,

1439
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,500
but when you get to where I am,
I promise you, you will.

1440
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,700
I'll be dead, you'll be old. But she...

1441
01:37:55,800 --> 01:38:00,000
She'll be dragging around a couple of
tattered, damaged children of her own,

1442
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:04,600
and you'll be the one
who has to tell them you're sorry.

1443
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,800
You know what? Maybe that'll happen.

1444
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:12,000
And if it does, I'll tell them I'm sorry,
and I'll live with it.

1445
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:16,600
But what's never gonna happen
and what I'm not gonna do

1446
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,400
is have to apologize
to a grown woman

1447
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:19,500
who comes to me and says,

1448
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,700
"I was kidnapped
when I was a little girl,

1449
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:24,000
"and my aunt hired you to find me.

1450
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,600
"And you did, you found me
with some strange family.

1451
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:30,500
"But you broke your promise
and you left me there.

1452
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:33,400
"Why? Why didn't you bring me home?

1453
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:38,400
"Because all the snacks and the outfits
and the family trips don't matter.

1454
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:42,700
"They stole me.

1455
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:46,500
"It wasn't my family
and you knew about it

1456
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,700
"and you knew better
and you did nothing."

1457
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,000
And maybe that grown woman
will forgive me,

1458
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,500
but I'll never forgive myself.

1459
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:04,400
I did what I did for the sake of the child.

1460
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:09,700
All right. For me, too.

1461
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:17,700
But now, I'm asking you
for the sake of the child.

1462
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,200
I'm begging you.

1463
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:29,300
You think about it.

1464
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,300
She's happy.

1465
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:43,500
What?

1466
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,800
She's happy here. I saw her.

1467
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,900
Angie, don't do this.

1468
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:54,000
If you call the police,
they will send her back.

1469
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,100
I'm not sending her anywhere.
Helene is her mother.

1470
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,700
She's better off here.

1471
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:03,600
Why? Because he's got money,
and he makes her sandwiches?

1472
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,700
Because he loves her.

1473
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:09,200
- Helene loves her, too.
- Helene doesn't treat her that way.

1474
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:11,200
Well, maybe she'll change.

1475
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,400
She won't change.
People don't change.

1476
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,100
Helene is arsenic.

1477
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,400
Angie, I know that this is hard.

1478
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,800
Look at me, I know it's hard.

1479
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:24,200
But I need you to stand by me.
I need you to say,

1480
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:25,400
"We're gonna make the right decision,

1481
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:26,700
"and we're gonna
make everything okay."

1482
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,900
Everything will be okay.

1483
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,100
Because we're gonna leave her here,

1484
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,300
and every now and then
we're gonna talk about her.

1485
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:35,500
And where she is,
and about what grade she's in.

1486
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:39,600
And that'll be okay, because
we're gonna know what school she's in,

1487
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:42,100
and we're gonna know she's happy,
and she's got birthday parties,

1488
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:45,100
and she smiles every day,
and she has sleepovers.

1489
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,400
Baby, I'm sorry.

1490
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:53,100
But you can't ask me
to do something that I can't do.

1491
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:59,100
And you can't ask me to live with it.

1492
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:04,600
Patrick, for me. Please?

1493
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:14,000
I will hate you for doing this,
and I don't want to.

1494
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:45,000
Once an icon of justice
and a model for crusaders,

1495
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:48,700
Jack Doyle is behind bars tonight.
Evelyn?

1496
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,900
Social Services, as demanded by law,

1497
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,300
will take time to examine little Amanda
before returning her to home,

1498
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:57,400
and the arms of a mother
who never gave up hope

1499
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,600
that she would see
her daughter again.

1500
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:07,900
- Helene, how do you feel...
- Helene, what does it feel like

1501
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,800
- to have your daughter with you now?
How do you feel?

1502
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:11,600
Helene, how you feeling
right now? How you feeling...

1503
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:15,400
Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

1504
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,800
Amanda, how do you feel
to see your mom?

1505
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,500
Hey, Amanda.

1506
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,600
Helene, how you feeling?

1507
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:23,600
- Tell us how it feels.
- Tell us what you're thinking right now.

1508
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:24,700
You must be so excited.
Give us your feelings.

1509
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:25,800
Oh, my sweetheart. Oh, my.

1510
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:28,500
Helene, the whole world wants to know
what you're feeling right now.

1511
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,300
How are you, sweetheart?

1512
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:33,400
Oh, my heart is brimming.

1513
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:39,900
And just God bless to everyone
and thank you to all...

1514
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,100
To all the policemen and the firemen,

1515
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,900
I feel like 9l11 right now.

1516
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:49,100
Oh, I swear to God, I mean, just...

1517
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,500
Do you have any
comments for parents out there

1518
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,000
that might be in a similar situation?

1519
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:55,700
Oh, just never let
your kids out of your sight.

1520
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,500
Don't trust them to no one.

1521
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:00,700
And just keep them in your arms,

1522
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:03,900
as much as they're in your heart,
you keep them in your arms.

1523
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,700
How about that?
A great end to that story.

1524
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,500
- Good news for everybody.
Yes, it is.

1525
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:37,500
- Sorry, I had to get some stuff.
- It's all right.

1526
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,200
You wanna talk for a minute?

1527
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,800
There's nothing to say.

1528
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:55,100
Sorry for being rude, I gotta be
out of here in, like, two minutes.

1529
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:57,000
Do your thing.

1530
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,500
- Think he'll like me?
- Who?

1531
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:09,900
My date.

1532
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:12,900
Oh, how could he not?

1533
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,200
You're sweet.

1534
01:46:15,300 --> 01:46:17,400
He seen me on my American Victim.

1535
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:20,500
He wrote me letters,
I was like, "Whatever."

1536
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:24,500
But then he seen my Meredith Vieira,
he drove down here from Providence.

1537
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:27,600
I'm like, "That's romantic." Right?

1538
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:29,100
How's your girlfriend?

1539
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:31,200
She's all right,
she's at the North Shore with her sister.

1540
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:34,000
Oh, hope she got
better family than I do, right?

1541
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:36,300
Those dirty motherfuckers.

1542
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:43,200
She don't get smart, I'll take you out.

1543
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:47,800
- How's Bea?
- Fuck Bea.

1544
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:50,000
I banned her from the apartment.

1545
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:54,100
She sold her unit,
moved out fancy-pants Melrose.

1546
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:57,300
Don't think she don't hate you
for Lionel going to jail, neither.

1547
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,300
Well, that's probably
why she never paid my bill.

1548
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,700
You should fucking sue.

1549
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,900
How about you, Helene?

1550
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,700
You hate me?

1551
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:08,400
Fuck no.

1552
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:12,600
Brother or not, he took my kid.
Fuck Lionel. She could have been hurt.

1553
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:15,700
- What about Amanda?
- What about Amanda?

1554
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:20,600
- Who's gonna watch her?
- Dottie.

1555
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:23,200
Yeah, does Dottie know that?

1556
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:26,000
- She will in five minutes.
- Great.

1557
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:30,500
Fuck, I'm gonna be late, too.
Unless you don't mind sitting for her.

1558
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,200
- Yeah, sure.
- For real?

1559
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:40,300
- Yeah, that's fine.
- She likes you.

1560
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,900
Bye, sweetheart.

1561
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,200
You're a godsend, Patrick.

1562
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,500
Bye.

1563
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:11,400
Is that Mirabelle?

1564
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:14,600
Annabelle.
